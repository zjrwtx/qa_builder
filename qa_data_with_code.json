    "question": "A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination. She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.\nUpon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th\u201375th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th\u201375th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5\u20133.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4\u201348 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.\nA right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm \u00d72.2 cm\u00d72.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()\nPostoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "A 56-year-old man was admitted to the renal unit of the tertiary university hospital with symptoms of polyuria with nocturia, and polydipsia with severe thirst for the past 2 months. Initially, the patient visited a local clinic and was diagnosed as type 2 DM with a fasting blood sugar, 150mg/dL. Despite being controlled hyperglycemia with an oral hypoglycemic agent, he continued drinking daily more than 8 L of cold water (about 10 bottles of refrigerated water, 750 ml capacity) and passed large amounts of urine frequently. He had no specific history including head trauma or mental disorder, and denied any pertinent family history. The patient showed no signs of systemic illness such as fever or arthralgia, or neurologic symptoms involving the central nervous system. He has been working as a gardener with 176 cm in height and 68 kg in weight (71 kg before this event). The physical examination was unremarkable with blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, pulse rate of 80/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and temperature of 36.8\u2103. In the laboratory findings, his white blood cell count was 9,700/mm3; hemoglobin, 13.4 g/dL; platelet, 376\u00d7103/mm3; sodium, 140 mEq/L; potassium, 3.8 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 12 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL and osmolality 295 mOsm/kg water. HbA1c was 7.2% and post-prandial glucose was checked around 180mg/dl with fasting blood sugar of 140 mg/dL. In urine analysis, the urine pH was 6.0; specific gravity 1.006; albumin (-); glucose (-); WBC 0-4/HPF; RBC 0-2/HPF, and osmolality 140mOsm/kg water. Fluid intake and output in 24 hours recorded 9 L in oral water intake from water containers and 11.7 L in urine output. In hormone assays, ACTH was 25.2 pg/mL (reference value, 6.0-76.0 pg/mL), prolactin 8 \u00b5g/L (reference value, 0-15 \u00b5g/L), cortisol 9.8 \u00b5g/dL (referencel value, 5-25 \u00b5g/dL), hGH 2.26 ng/mL (reference value, 0.5-17 ng/mL), and TSH 0.99 \u00b5U/mL (reference value, 0.5-4.7 \u00b5U/mL). Also, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was within normal range (reference value, <40 U/L).\nOn hospital day 5, the patient underwent a water deprivation test according to the method of Miller-Moses test because of persistent polydipsia and polyuria despite blood glucose control. The results are shown in . During dehydration, the patient lost 3kg (4.4% of body weight), and urine osmolality remained hypotonic below 130 mOsm/kg. Basal ADH level was 5.18 pg/dL, and the repeat ADH level following the stimulation by water deprivation was 3.95 pg/dL, which revealed no increment despite the increased serum osmolality up to 300 mOsm/kg from the baseline levels of 285 to 295 mOsm/kg. One puff (5 \u00b5g) of desmopressin nasal spray resulted in the increase of urine osmolality to 266 mOsm/kg (>100% increase from the baseline level, 126 mOsm/kg) and in the marked reduction of urine output from 200-410 ml/hr to 44-60 ml/hr. These results were compatible with CDI,, whose causes would be mostly idiopathic because of normal findings in hypothalamus and hypophysis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of sella ().\nOn discharge (hospital day 9), the dose of desmopressin nasal spray (minirin nasal spray\u00ae) was adjusted to 1 puff per 12 hrs (10 \u00b5g/day), and urine output was markedly reduced to below 2-3 L/day with no more intense thirst. Also, DM was controlled with fasting blood sugar below 115 mg/dL by metformin (novamet GR\u00ae 500mg bid) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended diet. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "In 2008, a 59-year-old Japanese woman was admitted for evaluation of renal disease. RA had been diagnosed at another hospital in 1972 when she presented with bilateral arthropathy of the hands, knees, ankles, and feet. Treatment was started with a combination of a gold preparation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but was not been effective. Prednisolone (PSL; 15 mg daily) and bucillamine (BUC; 200 mg daily) were started in 1987, but her disease remained active. Methotrexate (MTX; 5 mg daily) was started in 1995 but was discontinued because of nausea. In 2002, urinary protein was found to be positive by a dipstick urine test, and BUC was stopped. Then treatment was continued with PSL (5 mg/day) and loxoprofen (50 mg/day). However, urinary protein excretion increased in 2007, and serum creatinine (Cre) was elevated to 1.96 mg/dL.\nOn admission, the patient was 154.2 cm tall and weighed 44.0 kg, with a blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg and temperature of 36.4 \u00b0C. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities of the heart and lungs. The joints of her hands, knees, ankles, and feet showed bilateral swelling and deformity. In addition, the lower extremities were edematous. Her cervical spine was unstable, with flexion causing numbness in the upper limbs.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: serum Cre was 4.2 mg/dL, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 9.3 mL/min/1.73m3, C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.9 mg/dL, and SAA was 43.2. In addition, rheumatoid factor (RF) was positive at 59 U/mL (normal: < 10), and cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies were positive at 218.5 (normal < 4.5). 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 6.5 g, and the urine sediment contained 1 \u2013 5 red cells per high-power field (HPF). The disease activity score (DAS)-CRP was 7.1. Radiographs showed deformation of the finger and foot joints as well as atlantoaxial joint subluxation. Renal biopsy was performed for evaluation of her kidney disease.\nRenal biopsy\nLight microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen containing 4 glomeruli revealed global sclerosis in all 4. There was severe tubular atrophy, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis occupied ~ 95% of the entire renal cortex. All 4 glomeruli contained multinodular structures of amorphous material with a PAM-positive border. This material was positive for Congo-red and amyloid A, but was negative for \u03ba and \u03bb chains, \u03b2-2 microglobulin, and transthyretin (). Electron microscopy showed randomly arranged fibrils measuring 8 \u2013 12 nm in diameter corresponding to the amyloid deposits (f). AA amyloidosis was diagnosed from these findings. In addition to the glomeruli, amyloid deposits were mainly observed in the interlobular artery walls and tubulointerstitium (e). Endoscopic biopsy of the stomach, duodenum, and colon revealed AA-positive deposits in the small arteries and tissues of the submucosal layer (a).\nClinical course\nPSL was discontinued, and administration of a soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor inhibitor (etanercept; 25 mg every 2 weeks) was started in May 2008, but it was not effective. By September 2008, Cre was increased to 6.0 mg/dL. She underwent surgery to prepare an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. Etanercept was discontinued, and a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab; 8 mg/kg = 360 mg/month) was started in February 2009. After 3 months, her CRP decreased to 0.0 mg/dL, and the DAS28-CRP sore was 2.12. After 2 years of tocilizumab therapy, urinary protein excretion was decreased to 1.1 g/day, and Cre was 4.0 mg/dL. Subsequently, Cre remained in the range of 4.5 \u2013 5.0 mg/dL until December 2017. While Cre increased to 7.1 mg/dL after initiation of treatment with denosumab (a human monoclonal antibody that binds to receptor activator of NF\u03baB ligand) for osteoporosis in October 2018, it remained at 7.0 mg/dL in June 2019 ().\nGastroduodenal biopsy was performed in May 2013 and May 2017. On both occasions, no amyloid deposits were detected in the submucosal blood vessels (b). What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "A 34-year-old man was admitted for evaluation of worsening pedal edema. He was apparently healthy until four years back, when he developed edema of both feet and nonpruritic macular skin rash involving both lower limbs. Subsequently, he was detected to have hypertension, proteinuria and mild renal failure (6 months ago). He had no history of arthralgia, Raynaud's phenomenon, paraesthesia or gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\nSix weeks prior to admission in our centre, he developed weakness of left upper and lower limbs with slurring of speech and was hospitalized elsewhere. A computerized tomographic scan of head had revealed an infarct in the right middle cerebral artery territory and he was treated with aspirin, statins, and antihypertensives. He made a complete recovery but was detected to have renal failure and was referred to us for further evaluation.\nHe weighed 74 kg and had a height of 174 cm. He had pallor and bilateral pitting pedal edema. There was no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. Examination of cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and abdomen was normal. There were no neurological deficits.\nInvestigations revealed hemoglobin of 8.79 gm/dL, platelet count of 112000/mm3, total WBC count of 7960/mm3 - with a normal differential count, ESR of 40 mm at end of first hour. Urinalysis showed protein ++++, 6-8 RBCs/HPF; and 24 hour urine protein was 4420 mg. Blood urea was 72 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 3.1 mg/dL with normal serum levels of electrolytes. Liver function tests, PT and aPTT were normal. Serum albumin was 3.6 gm%, serum globulin 3.8 g/dL and serum cholesterol 240 mg/dL. Serum protein electrophoresis was normal. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. HBsAg, antihepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV antibodies were negative VDRL, cANCA, pANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies, ANA, antids DNA were negative. Serum homocysteine [12 \u00b5mol/L] was normal and serum complement levels were reduced (C3:70 mg/dL, C4:18 mg/dL). Serum cryoglobulin assay was positive. On PAGE electrophoresis, the mobility was suggestive of mixed cryoglobulins. HCV RNA was negative in serum [polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]. Qualitative analysis for HCV RNA [by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)] in the cryoprecipitate was negative []. Doppler study of extra cranial carotid and vertebral vessels was normal. Ultra sonogram of abdomen, ECG, and echocardiogram were normal. Bone marrow examination was normal. X-rays of chest, skull spine, and pelvis were normal. Kidney biopsy showed lobular accentuation of glomeruli with mesangial proliferation, mild endocapillary proliferation, and double contour of glomerular basement membrane on light microscopy. Intracapillary eosinophilic PAS positive hyaline deposits were noted []. Interstitium showed mononuclear infiltrates. Immunofluorescence showed mesangial and capillary granular positivity for C3 IgG and IgM. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "question": "A 67-year-old Japanese woman underwent OWHTO to treat SPONK that had occurred in the left medial femoral condyle (Fig. ). The patient reported the following history of the present illness. Pain in the left knee joint initially occurred at 1 year and 4 months before admission, without any particular trigger. Her former treating physician had provided conservative treatments such as oral administration of anti-inflammatory analgesics, rehabilitation including quadriceps muscle training, and guidance on the use of a cane to relieve weight bearing. However, this treatment was not successful in relieving her symptoms, and she was referred to our department for surgery. The patient had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and she had been taking oral candesartan and atorvastatin. The patient was a housewife with no noteworthy aspects related to social, family, or environmental history. On physical examination, the patient had a height of 157 cm, a body weight of 62 kg, and a body mass index of 25.2 kg/m2. She reported feeling pain in the medial joint space of the knee during walking, as well as during climbing or descending stairs. At the time of the first admission, her systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 165/97 mmHg. Table provides an overview of the patient\u2019s pain scores in the knee joint, ROM of the knee joint, and knee joint function. Neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings. Similarly, laboratory findings at the time of the first admission did not indicate any abnormality: total protein 7.3 g/dl, albumin 4.6 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 22 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 18 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 213 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 297 U/L, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 18 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, Na 142 mEq/L, Cl 104 mEq/L, K 4.5 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 21.4 mg/dl, creatinine 0.56 mg/dl, Ca 9.7 mg/dl, inorganic phosphorus 3.7 mg/dl, leukocytes 5100/\u03bcl, erythrocytes 5.00 \u00d7 106/\u03bcl, hemoglobin 14.4 g/dl, hematocrit 43.6%, and platelets 263 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl.\nThe HAL-SJ treatment program was divided into five phases []. Phase 1 consisted of preoperative observation from the day of hospital admission until the day of surgery. The patient\u2019s thigh circumference and lower leg length were measured preoperatively to adjust the HAL-SJ to the patient\u2019s physical size, which would ensure appropriate training. We palpated the patient\u2019s quadriceps muscles (vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and vastus lateralis) and attached electrodes to each muscle to detect the bioelectric potentials of the long axis along the belly of each muscle. We instructed the patient to perform knee extension and to contract her quadriceps. On the basis of these data, we instructed the patient to simulate the knee extension training, which would be performed postoperatively. Specifically, the patient sat with her lower leg hanging down naturally, and the height of the chair was adjusted so that the patient\u2019s feet were not in contact with the floor. The patient performed ten knee extensions with HAL-SJ assistance, using the muscle that exhibited the largest bioelectric potential amplitude.\nPhase 2 involved surgery (day of surgery). The patient underwent OWHTO (Figs. and ) using TomoFix (DePuy Synthes, Bettlach, Switzerland), artificial bone (OSferion60, \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate; Olympus Terumo Biomaterials, Tokyo, Japan), and biplanar osteotomy, as described by Takeuchi et al. []. The preoperative weight-bearing line (WBL) percentage [], calculated on the basis of an anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph of the affected leg in full knee extension, was 29.6%. The surgery was planned with a target postoperative WBL percentage of 62.5%. The actual enlarged angle and distance of osteotomy were 5.5 degrees and 7 mm, respectively.\nPhase 3 consisted of postoperative observation from day 1 to day 7 postoperatively. For postoperative rehabilitation, partial weight bearing was allowed after a non-weight-bearing period of 2 weeks, and full weight bearing began at 4 weeks postoperatively. The patient received rehabilitation training under the guidance of a physical therapist (ROM exercises and muscle-strengthening training) for 20\u201340 minutes each day, 5 days per week, from the first postoperative day until discharge. For ROM exercises, continuous passive motion training began on the first postoperative day for 1 hour per day and continued every day until discharge. On postoperative day 7, we attached electrodes to the quadriceps muscle to detect the bioelectric potential along the long axis of the rectus femoris muscle belly (Fig. ). Then, the patient was instructed to perform active knee extension exercises that involved contracting her quadriceps, thus simulating training with HAL-SJ (Fig. ).\nPhase 4 consisted of HAL-SJ therapy from postoperative day 8 to discharge. The CVC mode of HAL-SJ serves to support the patient\u2019s voluntary motion on the basis of voluntary muscle activity and the assistive torque provided to the knee joint []. In this study, we used the CVC mode, which allowed the operator to adjust the degree of physical support to maintain the patient\u2019s comfort while gradually reducing support as training progressed. In addition to the regular rehabilitation program (Fig. ), the patient performed HAL-JS-assisted knee extension exercises while sitting, which consisted of five sets of ten repetitions per set, twice per week (Fig. ). The training was performed six times before the patient was discharged (postoperative days 8, 10, 15, 17, 22, and 24). The mean training duration, including the time required to put on the HAL-SJ, was 15.5 \u00b1 1.4 minutes (15 minutes, 16 minutes, 17 minutes, 16 minutes, 13 minutes, and 16 minutes during training sessions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). There were no adverse events related to the use of HAL-SJ, and the patient was discharged 30 days after the surgery.\nPhase 5 consisted of post-HAL-SJ therapy observation from discharge until 3 months after the end of HAL-SJ therapy, during which the following indicators were assessed: EL, assessed as the difference between the maximum knee joint extension angle during passive exercise and that during active exercise; knee pain rated on the visual analogue scale (VAS); isometric knee extension muscle strength (IKEMS); active ROM before surgery, before and after HAL-SJ training, and at 1 and 3 months after the end of training; and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score [] before surgery, at discharge, and at 1 and 3 months after the end of training. Furthermore, we used lateral radiographs to measure the tibial slope angle (TSA) and Insall-Salvati ratio (ISR) as indicators of patellar tendon shortening before surgery and after implant removal at 1 year after the operation [] (Fig. ). Measurement of knee ROM was performed using goniometry, and the landmarks used in the measurements were the greater trochanter of the femur, proximal head of the fibula, and lateral malleolus. Goniometry was used because it has been reported that goniometric measurements of ROM are more reliable than visual observation, with an accuracy of up to 1.0 degree []. The maximal IKEMS of the operated leg was assessed with the patient in a sitting position, with the hips and knees flexed at 90 degrees. A \u03bcTas F-1 handheld dynamometer (Anima Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was fixed to the chair, and two measurements were recorded. Each trial lasted 3\u20135 seconds, with 30 seconds of rest between trials. The higher score of two valid trials was recorded. All measurements were performed by a single trained physical therapist to eliminate interobserver variability. The EL, VAS, IKEMS, and ROM results are shown in Table . The EL improved from 3 degrees preoperatively to 0 degrees at the end of the sixth HAL-SJ training session, but it returned to 3 degrees at 1 and 3 months after the end of the training. When we compared results obtained before training against those obtained after each of the six training sessions, we observed that three sessions produced improved EL and three sessions produced improved or relatively constant VAS scores immediately after training. However, for the other three sessions, the patient reported increased pain immediately after training, with the greatest increase in pain reported immediately after the first HAL-SJ training session, when the VAS score was 1.7 times higher immediately after training than before training. The EL improved after training sessions 1 and 3, when the patient reported increased knee pain (expressed as the VAS score). However, the EL did not change after training sessions 2 and 4, when the patient reported less knee pain (improved VAS score immediately after training). The patient did not refuse to undergo training because of increased pain. The IKEMS value was the largest preoperatively (17.6 kgf) and decreased to its lowest value (30% of the preoperative strength) before the first HAL-SJ intervention at 8 days after the operation. The IKEMS remained relatively constant throughout HAL-SJ training but recovered to the preoperative value during follow-up (18.7 and 16.6 kgf at 1 and 3 months, respectively, after completion of HAL-SJ training). The active ROM also recovered to the preoperative value by the end of the sixth HAL-SJ training session. Thereafter, the extension ROM did not change, but the flexion ROM was maintained or improved. The JOA score decreased from 60 points preoperatively to 55 points at discharge, but it improved with time, reaching 65 and 85 points at 1 and 3 months, respectively, after the end of HAL-SJ training. Whereas the TSA was maintained at 13.1 degrees before and after the surgery, the ISR decreased from 1.13 preoperatively to 0.97 postoperatively. At 6 months after surgery, the passive ROM was 0\u2013135 degrees, and the JOA score was 90 points. There were no complications throughout the preparation, surgery, or rehabilitation process. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "This is a 61-year-old woman who presented with diabetic symptoms and was misclassified as having type 1 diabetes with negative autoimmune-related type 1 diabetes antibodies (Tyrosine Phosphatase antibodies and Glutamic acid Decarboxylase antibodies). She was referred to our center due to uncontrolled diabetes despite the high doses of insulin and the coexistence of severe insulin resistance and decreased body mass index (BMI: 19.4 kg/m2). Age of presentation was 29 years and for the following 30 years she was treated with multiple daily insulin injections with high insulin requirements (5 IU/kg/day) together with metformin 2 g/day for 30 years, but constantly displaying poor glycemic control. Dyslipidemia was observed at the age of 35 years with raised cholesterol levels and severe hypertriglyceridemia despite intense lipid lowering therapy which lately consisted of the combination of fenofibrate 145 mg, rosuvastatin 40 mg/day and omega-3 fatty acids/day together with restricted fat intake. Hypertension was observed at the age of 5 years, and lately treated with the combination of nifedipine 120 mg/day, eplerenone 25 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day.\nShe also had micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes indicating constantly insufficient glycemic control. She presented peripheral diabetic neuropathy (distal symmetric polyneuropathy) and nephropathy (eGFR: 43 ml/min, albuminuria: 314 mg/24 h). She also suffered from severe cardiovascular disease including peripheral artery disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Peripheral artery disease presented as intermittent claudication and carotid stenosis, for which she had a right carotid endarterectomy at the age of 52 years old. She was managed with clopidogrel 75 mg/day.\nShe had menarche at the age of 11, followed by irregular menstruation and then premature menopause at the age of 38. She also reported polycystic ovarian syndrome and never conceived. She underwent hysterectomy due to fibroids at the age of 54. She was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 58 and has since received alendronate 70 mg/week.\nIt has not been possible to conduct genetic family screening. Her mother and her maternal aunt displayed a lipodystrophy phenotype with fat loss of upper and lower extremities, presented diabetes from the ages of 25 and 28 respectively, and both showed early presentation of cardiovascular disease, presenting as ischemic stroke at the age of 45 years old and myocardial infarction at the same age, respectively. Her mother had reproductive problems and six miscarriages. Two out of four sisters and one brother developed hypertension and dyslipidemia at a young age.\nA genetic analysis for lipodystrophy was performed and included the sequence and deletion/duplication analysis of the following genes: ADRA2A, AGPAT2, AKT2, BSCL2, CAV1, CAVIN1, CIDEC, FBN1, KCNJ6, LIPE, LMNA, LMNB2, PCYT1A, PIK3R1, PLIN1, POLD1, PPARG, PSMB8, and ZMPSTE24. The analysis revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the PPARG gene (c470A>G, p. Glu157Gly, exon3) (The University of Chicago Genetic Services Laboratory). This particular amino acid change has not been described in other patients with PPARG-related disorders, but a different pathogenic sequence change affecting the same amino acid residue (p. Glu157Asp) has been described in a family with PPARG-related lipodystrophy (). In our case the substitution of the negative charged glutamic acid at position 157 by the hydrophobic glycine could possibly lead to the formation of a non-functional protein responsible for the lipodystrophy phenotype. According to missense interpretation by experimental report classifier (MITER) the described mutation is associated with 78.6% probability of causing FPLD3 and 6.5-fold increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nExamination revealed clinical signs of lipodystrophy of upper and lower limbs and gluteal area. Facial fat and abdominal prominence were also noted. She also had phlebectasia, hirsutism and cervical acanthosis nigricans. The patient mentioned that this phenotype was present from the age of 20 years old. Blood pressure was 175/84 mmHg.She was underweighted with a BMI: 19.40 kg/m2 (weight: 46 kg, height: 154 cm) ().\nTo assess the degree of regional fat loss in this case, we compared the total and proportional fat content in defined body regions using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with a group of healthy, lean postmenopausal women (). The case has a relatively short stature and as a consequence a total lean mass not far from the lower end the 95% confidence interval of the comparators. The total fat mass was drastically lower giving a first indication of a lipodystrophic state. The visceral fat mass was similar to the comparators whilst the proportional fat content in extremities was drastically reduced showing the classic features of peripheral fat loss in partial lipodystrophy ().\nAt the time of the first evaluation biochemical measurements revealed glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 10%, a total cholesterol of 132 mg/dl of which high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) was 25 mg/dl. There was severe hypertriglyceridemia at 2.919 mg/dl. Further tests confirmed chronic kidney disease (blood urea nitrogen: 49.6 mg/dl, creatinine: 1.3 mg/dl, eGFR: 43 ml/min) and albuminuria (314 mg/24 h).\nWe performed glucagon stimulation test which revealed residual insulin secretion (fasting C-peptide: 2.09 ng/ml, 6 min after 1 mg of glucagon infusion C-peptide: 3.13 ng/ml). Plasma leptin concentration was close to zero (0.43 ng/ml).\nAbdominal ultrasound confirmed hepatic steatosis and transient elastography (fibroscan) detected liver stiffness of 18 Kpa. Abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was unremarkable apart from hepatomegaly with a liver percentage fat fraction of 9.4%, and an enlarged spleen (). Cardiac MRI revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (maximal wall thickness 17 mm) and myocardial fibrosis in the basal interventricular septum (LGE SCORE 1/48, LGE mass 2%). Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal mitral regurgitation, and ejection fraction of 60% ().\nAfter noting her poor glycemic control, her antidiabetic treatment was intensified with empagliflozin 10 mg/daily and liraglutide 1.8 mg/daily, but this resulted only in a slight improvement in glycemic control after 3 months (HbA1c: 9.3%), despite additional strict dietetic management, but without any change in insulin management. We did not observe any change in triglyceride (TG) levels.\nMetreleptin was then initiated at 5 mg once daily on top of the current lipid and diabetes management. Glycemic control and hypertriglyceridemia improved within two months of treatment evidenced by decrease of HbA1C from 10 to 8.7% and the reduction of TG from a baseline value of 2.919 to 242 mg/dl. At six months there was further reduction in HbA1C (7.9%) and in TG (198 mg/dl). This improvement was sustained one year after treatment with metreleptin in the same dose (HbA1C: 8%, TG: 185 mg/dl-standard serum determinations are listed in ), (). Insulin doses were reduced from more than 5 to 2.22 IU/kg/day. Blood pressure was also better controlled without any change in anti-hypertensive medication.\nAt six months of metreleptin treatment a reduced liver fat content was observed (MRI estimated liver percentage fat fraction was reduced from 9.4 to 6.8%). However, liver stiffness assessed by transient elastography remained stable. A repeated DXA scan showed unchanged total fat mass content and cardiac MRI revealed no change (). Reduction in appetite following metreleptin treatment was reported. Hunger scales for the assessment of appetite were not used. Metreleptin treatment was well tolerated with no other adverse effects. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "A 53-year old man (height, 175 cm; weight, 87 kg) was scheduled to undergo subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein reconstruction for pancreatic cancer after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Laparoscopic left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma was performed 1 year prior; therefore, harvesting the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction was planned because the left renal vein was too short. Preoperative serum creatinine level and potassium level were 1.39 mg/dL and 4.1 mEq/L, respectively.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced rapidly with propofol, rocuronium, fentanyl, and remifentanil and maintained with desflurane. The patient\u2019s vital signs remained stable while resection of the distal stomach, gallbladder, distal common bile duct, and pancreatic head was performed. Bleeding from the first jejunal vein (J1V) occurred during adhesion detachment around the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and clamping of the J1V was required to control the bleeding. Immediately after J1V clamping, bowel congestion progressed because the patient\u2019s intestinal blood flow had been bypassed from the SMV to the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein through J1V due to complete obstruction of the portal vein by the tumor. Therefore, a heparin-coated bypass tube (ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube, TORAY MEDICAL Co., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted from the SMV to the right great saphenous vein to relieve the bowel congestion. Several minutes after insertion of the ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube, blood potassium level rose from 4.7 mEq/L to 6.0 mEq/L, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia occurred. Chest compression was promptly performed by surgeons, and anesthesiologists attempted direct current defibrillation several times; epinephrine, magnesium sulphate, bicarbonate, lidocaine, and amiodarone were also administered. In addition to resuscitation, anesthesiologists inserted a blood-access catheter to the right internal jugular vein and started continuous renal replacement therapy to prevent elevation of blood potassium level. Spontaneous circulation was recovered after 30 min. The surgical team decided to discontinue the surgery, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after packing gauze into the abdomen and with the ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube left inserted. Total blood loss was 5620 mL, and total fluid balance was + 6115 mL. The operation time was 10 h 30 min.\nTwo days after the first operation, the patient was scheduled to undergo tumor resection and portal vein reconstruction with REIV. The surgical team abandoned using the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction because of concerns that brain congestion after harvesting the jugular vein could affect brain function recovery. Anesthesia was maintained with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, rocuronium, and remifentanil. Continuous hemodiafiltration had been performed in the ICU due to persistent anuria and continued during the operation to prevent hyperkalemia. Both legs were compressed with a pneumatic compression device throughout the operation to prevent deep venous thrombosis formation. A section of the REIV 5 cm in length was harvested intraperitoneally with a surgical stapler, and the REIV distal end was closed with a 4-0 polypropylene running suture. The inferior epigastric vein, pubic branch of the obturator vein, and the deep circumflex iliac vein were preserved. A surgical nurse noticed swelling of the patient\u2019s right leg 2 h after harvesting; the surgical team ensured careful observation throughout the surgery because a transient change by congestion of the right leg was suspected. Blood potassium level was slightly elevated after REIV resection, but ventricular arrhythmia was absent. Surgery was completed as scheduled (operation time, 7 h 3 min), and the patient was transferred to the ICU again. Total blood loss and total fluid balance were 2485 mL and + 2587 mL, respectively.\nOn ICU admission, distention and fullness of the right leg worsened. An orthopedist diagnosed the patient with acute compartment syndrome, and right leg elevation to lower the intracompartmental pressure was initiated. Blood potassium level was rapidly elevated immediately after leg elevation (Fig. ), which caused sustained ventricular tachycardia despite efforts to lower blood potassium level such as the administration of bicarbonate, glucose-insulin, and continuous hemodialysis with potassium-free dialysate. Chest compressions were initiated immediately. Ventricular tachycardia was prolonged; therefore, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) was induced, and spontaneous circulation was recovered after resolution of hyperkalemia (Fig. , Table ). Emergent fasciotomy was performed by orthopedists 1 h after induction of V-A ECMO because the intracompartmental tissue pressure of the anterior compartment was 70 mmHg.\nV-A ECMO was withdrawn 2 days later, and the patient was extubated 10 days after portal vein reconstruction. He had no apparent neural deficits; however, paralysis and paresthesia of the right leg persisted after discharge from the ICU 17 days post-operatively. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 51-year-old lady presented to our emergency department because of generalized body ache and marked weakness in both lower extremities for two days duration. She had no history of vomiting, diarrhea, frequent urination, recent use of laxatives or diuretics, current or previous use of lithium, licorice ingestion, or activities leading to profuse sweating. Past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, seizure disorder and schizoaffective disorder. She also had a long-term history of alcoholism, consuming two to three pints of vodka every day for about 20 years. Her last drink of alcohol was about 48 hours prior to presentation. On examination, her weight was 79 kg, height 65 inches, body mass index 29.3 kg/m2. Vital signs were stable, temp 98.6\u00b0F, heart rate 68 bpm, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 113/71 mmHg and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. She was alert and oriented, there was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. Cardiac examination revealed a regular sinus rhythm with no murmurs. There were no deformities or edema of the extremities and distal pulses were present. There was no cushingoid facies, buffalo hump or abdominal striae noted. Neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness of 4/5, with intact sensory system and reflexes. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable.\nBiochemical analysis of the serum showed severe electrolyte disturbances, a potassium level of 2.3 mmol/L (reference 3.6\u22125.1 mmol/L), magnesium level of 0.9 mg/dL (reference 1.8\u22123.0 mg/dL), phosphorus level of 2.0 mg/dL (reference 2.4\u22124.6 mg/dL), corrected calcium level of 7.8 mg/dL (reference 8.9\u221210.3 mg/dL). Renal function was mildly deranged with Creatinine of 1.35 mg/dL (reference 0.4\u22121.3 mg/dL) and BUN of 12 mg/dL (reference 8\u221220mg/dL). The results of hepatic enzymes, AST 113 IU/l (reference 15\u221241 IU/l), ALT 42 IU/l (reference 17\u221263 IU/l) was suggestive of alcohol induced hepatic damage. Electrocardiogram (ECG) () showed no arrhythmias, but changes characteristic of hypokalemia with increased amplitude of the U-wave and marked corrected QT segment prolongation (QTc 551 ms). Patient was admitted to intensive care unit for severe hypokalemia management and cardiac monitoring. Aggressive supplementation of electrolytes was initiated (), however despite supplementation with enteral and parenteral potassium as well as magnesium and phosphate, potassium level failed to increase () and subsequently she had a sinus bradycardia followed by asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated when asystole was noted, return of spontaneous circulation was obtained after 8 minutes of resuscitation. Patient was mechanically ventilated for two days and her own efficient respiration was reestablished, then she was successfully extubated. During the following days, the patient was conscious, alert and oriented to time, place and person. Further laboratory testing revealed thyroid- stimulating hormone level was 1.100 mIU/L (reference 0.45\u22124.50 mIU/L). Active renin level was 0.653ng/ml/hr (reference 0.167\u22125.38 ng/ml/hr), aldosterone levels was <0.01 ng/dL (reference 0.00\u2212 30 ng/dL). Creatine kinase (CK) level was 6922 U/L (reference 38\u2013297 IU/L), indicating rhabdomyolysis. The arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH of 7.430, partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 29 mmHg; partial pressure of oxygen was 74 mmHg; HCO3 was 25 mmol/L and base excess of -4.7 mmol/L. Urinalysis showed dilute urine of 1.010 g/mL specific gravity (reference 1.005 to 1.030), Urine pH of 6.5, and no proteinuria. Urine electrolytes were measured on spot urine analysis and twenty-four-hour urine collection, result depicted in . Serial electrocardiogram monitoring showed resolution of ECG changes (). Follow up laboratory tests revealed normalization of electrolytes level (). Post cardiac arrest serial ECGs didn\u2019t reveal any ischemic changes, cardiac enzymes were not elevated and echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function, Ejection Fraction of 60\u201365%. Cardiac arrest was presumed to be secondary to severe hypokalemia and there was no necessity for further cardiac evaluation. She was then discharged from the hospital with recommendations for abstinence from alcohol. Follow up outpatient appointment with primary care physician was provided. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 43-years-old Caucasian male (height 198 cm, weight 115 kg, tobacco smoker \u2013 1 packet of cigarettes/day) was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital from a municipal hospital because of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome associated with infection and necrosis of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia of the left lower leg. The signs and symptoms of the disease \u2013 edema and pain affecting the left leg-began 7 days before admission. The patient's medical history was significant for hepatitis C (HCV), treated with ribavarin and interferon, and diabetes mellitus treated with insulin. On the day of admission the HCV-RNA test was negative. A mosquito bite was the probable triggering event.\nOn admission to the ICU the patient was confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9. He was afebrile, had tachycardia, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, hypotension, with a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, and relative respiratory insufficiency (oxygen saturation of 88% \u2013 90%). He had moderately-dilated pupils with a delayed light reflex. We noted crepitus over the bilateral lung fields, a tender abdomen with absent bowel sounds, and oliguria. There were numerous hemorrhagic extravasations on the skin. Examination of the left leg revealed diffuse edema of the skin, with marked erythema and necrosis; margins of infection were sharply demarcated, spreading onto the buttock and perineum on the left side (Figure ). Laboratory tests showed a metabolic acidosis, with the following values: base excess -15 mmol/l, lactate level 7.3 mmol/l, PaO2 64 mmHg, platelet count 29,000/mm3, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.24, serum creatinine 691.6 \u03bcmol/l, bilirubin 62.6 \u03bcmol/l, and C-reactive Protein (CRP) 224.6 \u03bcg/dl.\nThe Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on the day of admission was 31 points and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 18 points. The patient required fluid resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation in BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) mode, continuous intravenous infusion of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) and low doses of steroids to restore blood pressure. After obtaining cultures from the affected tissue, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in appropriate media, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotics were immediately administered (meropenem 3 g/day in a 3-h infusion, vancomycin 3 g/day in continuous infusion, metronidazole 1.5/day in 3 divided doses). Because of progressive organ dysfunction, therapy was started with activated protein C, in doses of 24 \u03bcg/kg/h; continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was also started. After several hours, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats per minute and his blood pressure decreased to 80/50 mmHg. Electrical cardioversion was performed three times, followed by continuous infusion of cordarone (12 mg/kg/day). During this time, intensive fluid resuscitation was administered. During the first day, the patient received 12,800 ml of fluid (colloids and crystalloids). His unstable condition did not allow for early surgical management.\nThe cultures from the affected areas of skin contained Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus sciuri. Based on sensitivity results, vancomycin and metronidazole were discontinued, and penicillin G was started at a dose of 60 million units a day (intravenous) in 6 divided doses. Because the patient's poor condition persisted and the microbes were sensitive to clindamycin, it was added at 2.7 g/day in 3 divided doses. In spite of the lack of information about G-pathogens, meropenem was continued. The patient also received 40 g of commercially available gamma-globulin (intravenous), 8 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 8 units of platelets. After several days his condition improved, with urine output of 100\u2013150 ml/h and resolution of his metabolic acidosis. On the sixth day, the patient's hemodynamic parameters deteriorated again, with tachycardia to 160 beats per minute and a decrease in blood pressure to 85/60 mmHg. CVVH was administered again for detoxification. On the seventh day, the necrotic tissue was surgically excised (Figures , ). We also noted a progressive decline in the white blood cell count to 2,200/mm3, and administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor.\nCultures of the BAL showed 104 colony-forming units/ml of methycillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). (The patient had been a carrier of methycillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] isolated from his nose vestibule on admission.) Because MRSA also was present in blood cultures and the patient's condition remained poor, linezolid 1.2 g a day in 2 divided doses was initiated based on additional results of susceptibility tests. After 10 days of intensive treatment, the patient was hemodynamically stable, and we discontinued mechanical ventilation. 25 days after admission the patient was discharged to the trauma surgery ward for plastic reconstruction of his wounds. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 65-year-old female consulted our office for naturopathic primary-care support for a myriad of conditions, which included diabetes with weight gain, chronic fatigue, depression with emotional lability, frequent colds, and recurrent urinary tract infections. The latter was attributed to a medullary sponge kidney as was her history of kidney stones and hypertension. The patient also suffered with long-standing acid reflux and was prone to irritable bowel with diarrhea. She had also suffered with multiple abscesses in the past as well as poor generalized wound healing. A history of fibroadenomas was also noted. The patient recollected, \u201cnever being well\u201d, even as a child. She described her diet as a child as \u201cdeficient\u201d and consisted mostly of canned beans and bread, which she attributed to her poor socioeconomic status as a child.\nPharmacological management of her diabetic condition included the use of metformin/sitagliptin (1,000 mg/50 mg, taken twice per day) and gliclazide (30 mg), also taken twice per day.\nAdditional medications included ramipril (5 mg/day), ranitidine (150 mg, twice per day), low-dose aspirin (81 mg/ day), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day), allopurinol (100 mg/ day), citalopram (40 mg/day), and mirabegron (50 mg/day).\nPhysical examination revealed a 1.69 m (66.5 inch), 88.5 kg (195.0 lb) female. Body mass index was calculated at 31.0 (Obese Class I) (32). Central waist measurement was 112 cm, while her hips measured 118 cm. Blood pressure was 114/64 mmHg, measured at the left brachial artery. Bioimpedance analysis revealed a lean body mass of 49.9 kg (111.0 lbs) and a fat mass of 38.0 kg (84.0 lbs).\nLaboratory assessment prior to date of initial consult (June 2017) revealed a HBA1C of 7.8% and a random glucose of 6.5 mmol/L.

    "question": "An 18-year-old adolescent female was evaluated at 15 weeks\u2019 gestation for history of persistent emesis for four weeks, extreme fatigue and red colored urine for one day. There was no history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or urinary tract infection.\nPast medical history was unremarkable for diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other autoimmune diseases. She was not known to have hyperthyroidism in the past. Pregnancy had been uneventful except for persistent episodes of emesis for past one month. There was no prior history of mood symptoms or altered mental status. There was no history of heat intolerance, diarrhea, or weight loss. There was no recent history of usage of corticosteroid, loop or thiazide diuretic, strenuous exercise, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge of grape-like vesicles, seizures, alcohol intake, and carbohydrate load. Family history was notable only for type 2 diabetes in the father. There was no known family history of autoimmune diseases, thyroid disorders, hypokalemia, and periodic paralysis. There was no consanguinity.\nVital signs upon presentation showed blood pressure (BP) 142/87 mm Hg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oral temperature 38.9 \u00b0C (102.02 \u00b0F), respiratory rate 18 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her height was 172.7 cm and weight was 109 kg (240 lb 4.8 oz). Physical examination was remarkable for an overweight female who was awake but slow to respond. There was no goiter and ophthalmopathy. There was mild scleral icterus. There was no tremor or pretibial edema.\nSerum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was 246,000 mIU/mL and sonogram confirmed the presence of a single viable intrauterine fetus of approximately 15 weeks gestation with expected uterine size. Renal function test showed sodium 127 mmol/L, potassium 2.5 mmol/L, bicarbonate 33 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 123 mg/dL, serum creatinine 4.2 mg/dL (MDRD estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 17 mL/min/1.73 m2), calcium 9.5 mg/dL, phosphorus 2.7 mg/dL and magnesium of 1 mg/dL. Liver function test showed aspartate aminotransferase 140 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 203 IU/L, total bilirubin 2.9 mg/dL, ammonia 55 \u00b5mol/L, and serum albumin 3.1 gm/dl. Renal function test two months prior to pregnancy showed normal serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL (MDRD eGFR 113 mL/min/1.73 m2) and normal electrolytes (serum sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.9 mg/dL, and magnesium was not available) Serum creatine kinase was normal at 121 U/L (normal 0\u2013180 U/L). Urine sodium was <10 mmol/L, urine creatinine 84 mg/dL, urine potassium 28 mmol/L and urine osmolality was 344 mOsm/kg. Fractional excretion of sodium was 0.4%. Urinalysis showed 1+ proteinuria, no microscopic hematuria, 5 white cells per high power field, no ketonuria, pH 5, specific gravity of 1.015, and negative nitrites and leukocytes. Plasma renin activity was 14 ng/mL/h (normal 0.5\u20134 ng/mL/h, upright) and serum aldosterone was 13 ng/dL (normal 4\u201331 ng/dL, upright). Blood and urine cultures were negative. Other extensive investigations for infectious etiologies were also negative. Urine for Chlamydia and Neisseria was negative. SARS-CoV-2 DNA PCR from the nasopharyngeal swab was negative. Other labs were notable for undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level < 0.030 mIU/L (reference 0.4\u20135 mIU/L), total T3 238 ng/dL (reference 87\u2013178 ng/dL), and free T4 > 6.99 ng/dL (reference 0.6\u20131.2 ng/dL). Computed tomography of the head showed no acute intracranial abnormalities.\nInitial management included administration of intravenous fluids (IVF), propranolol, potassium iodide, propylthiouracil (PTU), and hydrocortisone. A presumptive diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum with thyroid storm and AKI secondary to persistent emesis was made. She met criteria for thyroid storm due to elevated serum free T4 and total T3 with undetected TSH, along with pyrexia, tachycardia, icterus, and altered mental status. Her clinical condition improved somewhat after receiving PTU, propranolol, and hydrocortisone as heart rate, blood pressure, and free T4 began to decrease. Her mental status improved and she became more alert and engaged in conversation. Given tachycardia and hypertension, she was started on propranolol 60 mg every 4 hours which was later converted to 160 mg daily.\nOther thyroid studies showed thyroid peroxidase antibody 0.3 IU/mL (reference < 9 IU/mL), TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) < 0.90 (reference < 1.75 IU/L), and undetected thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) of < 0.10 (reference \u2264 0.54 IU/L). Given negative TRAb, Graves\u2019 disease was highly unlikely. Serum free T4 normalized in ten days, TSH in two weeks and total T3 in five days. Given pregnancy, further modalities including radioactive iodine uptake study were not pursued, given risk of fetal hypothyroidism, mental retardation, and increased risk of malignancy. Partial molar pregnancy was initially considered due to presentation of thyroid storm, however, the beta-hCG level was trending down and the patient did not show any signs of pre-eclampsia. Thyroid sonogram showed normal sized thyroid with homogenous thyroid texture and without increased vascularity, making Grave\u2019s disease unlikely. Investigations for AKI included renal sonogram which showed right kidney measuring 12.8 cm in length and left kidney measuring 12.6 cm in length with bilateral normal cortical echogenicity without evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrocalcinosis. Hepatic sonogram showed gallbladder sludge. A chest X-ray was normal without pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly. Electrocardiogram showed normal Q-T interval. Echocardiogram was normal with ejection fraction of 65%. Cardiac enzymes were normal.\nPTU was later changed to methimazole as she was no longer in the first trimester of pregnancy and as she demonstrated signs of liver insufficiency. Anti-emetics and IVF were discontinued after few days as the patient was able to tolerate well by mouth. Hydrocortisone was discontinued after two days. Subsequently, propranolol was discontinued along with methimazole, as the beta-hCG mediated hyperemesis was thought to be the likely etiology of thyroid symptoms. Her vital signs, including BPs, remained stable and her thyroid levels returned to normal without anti-thyroid drugs. Serum beta-hCG at discharge was 175,557 mIU/mL. Given decreasing level of hCG without other signs or symptoms of gestational trophoblastic disease, molar pregnancy was unlikely. She was discharged without any thyroid medications.\nDuring the hospitalization, her serum potassium remained around 2.4\u20132.9 meq/L along with serum bicarbonate 30\u201338 meq/L despite resolution of emesis. Serum magnesium remained low, as well as with values ranging from 1\u20131.4 mg/dL. Twenty-four hour urine collection showed a urine calcium of 0.04 mg/kg/day. Random urine calcium to creatinine ratio was also low at 0.005. She required multiple intravenous potassium and magnesium supplements. Discharge serum potassium and magnesium was 3.5 meq/L and 1.2 mg/dL, respectively. She was discharged on magnesium oxide 400 mg daily and potassium chloride 10 meq twice daily. BUN and serum creatinine slowly improved with intravenous hydration. Kidney biopsy was not performed and renal replacement therapy was not required. Discharge BUN and serum creatinine was 15 mg/dL and 0.97 mg/dL (MDRD eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), respectively. Due to the persistent hypokalemia, alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria despite resolution of emesis, a genetic testing by next generation sequence analysis was done which showed that the patient was homozygous in the SLCA123 (NM_001126108.2) gene for a known sequence variant designated c.2581C>T (p.Arg861Cys) (Prevention Genetics, Marshfield, WI, USA). No further in vitro functional studies were performed, hence the exact functional implication of this variant was unknown. However, to determine the pathogenicity of this variant, in silico tests were performed using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, FATHMM and MutationTaster. The resulting prediction utilizing these in silico tools was \u201cPathogenic\u201d. At 37 weeks gestation, a healthy infant of 3.5 kilograms was born vaginally without any perinatal complications. The serum creatinine remained stable at 0.7 mg/dL after delivery (MDRD eGFR 132 mL/min/1.73 m2). What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "The patient is a 78-year-old male patient with renal disease from 9 years ago (March 2005). He has lived in Semnan, Iran. His medical records were reviewed in October 2014. Laboratory findings in the patient at first were as follows: BUN = 22, Cr = 1.3, weight: 60 kg, height: 166 cm, blood pressure 145/95 mmHg. The patient was treated. The BUN and creatinine levels gradually increased and reached to BUN = 43 and Cr = 4 thirty months after the first referral. All laboratory tests were performed in a medical diagnostic laboratory using the calibrated equipment and common methods. The BUN and creatinine levels were measured by auto analyzer TC-6062 manufactured by Tecom Co, China. Blood pressure was measured by the Riester sphygmomanometer (Germany). At that time he had referred for arteriovenous graft and an arteriovenous fistula made by a surgeon. Six months later he had a functional fistula. Patients were treated with the conventional treatment and Eprex. Specific variables in this case were creatinine and GFR. Blood pressure controlled in the range of 110/80 mmHg. The patient's GFR decreased from 20 to 14 cc/min and his last blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg. The mean serum creatinine level was 3, maximum 4.2 and minimum 1.5. At present, the patient is in stage 4 of CKD and under usual medical treatment. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 23-year-old man presented to hospital with a 2-week history of oedema, frothy urine and lower abdominal pain. This is on a background of ulcerative colitis (UC) for which he was on sulfasalazine. He denied any other regular medications, over the counter medications or herbal supplements. His family history included his mother having IgA nephropathy. He was an occasional smoker and rarely consumed alcohol. He denied illicit drug use. On examination, he was mildly tachycardic (105 beats per minute) and normotensive. He was 180 cm tall and weighed 93 kg. He had mild bilateral pitting oedema to his knees. The rest of his examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed normal renal function with a creatinine of 75 \u03bcmol/L, hypoalbuminaemia with a serum albumin of 15 g/l and urinalysis revealing 3+ protein. His urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) was 944.9 mg/mmol. His total cholesterol was 8.3 mmol/L. GN, vasculitis, infection and myeloma screen (dsDNA, C3 & C4, anti-PLA-2R, hepatitis B & C serology, serum free light chains and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation) were negative, with the exception of a positive atypical perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Importantly the myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3) titres were both < 1 IU/ml. ANCA positivity is most likely explained by our patient\u2019s history of UC where ANCA positivity is reported in 60\u201380% of patients, with a predominant p-ANCA pattern [].\nDuring preparation for renal biopsy our patient was found to have a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 47 s. This corrected on a mixing study. Factor 12 deficiency (29%) was subsequently identified. Haematology opinion was that this conferred no increase in in vivo bleeding risk.\nRenal biopsy was undertaken with LM revealing no morphological abnormality (see Fig. ). IF revealed nonspecific trace glomerular deposits of IgM and C3. MCD was the most likely diagnosis. Our patient was consequently commenced on 75 mg oral prednisone daily.\nAfter 1 month our patient achieved complete remission. He was no longer oedematous, his serum albumin was 33 g/l (from 15 g/L) and uACR was 0.7 mg/mmol (from 944.9 mg/mmol). His prednisone was slowly weaned from 75 mg daily to 50 mg daily for a fortnight and then 25 mg daily for a fortnight. Our patient remained in remission with a serum albumin of 39 g/L, total cholesterol of 6 mmol/L and no albuminuria.\nThe electron microscopy (EM) report from our patient\u2019s renal biopsy returned 2 months later. This revealed patchy foot process effacement, and mesangial expansion with some deposits suggestive of a mesangiopathic process (see Fig. ).\nOur patient then suffered a dramatic relapse with the prednisone dose at 20 mg/day. He reported recurrence of frothy urine, 4 kg of weight gain and proteinuria (on urine dipstick given for home monitoring). His prednisone was increased to 25 mg daily but despite this his oedema worsened and proteinuria persisted. Therefore his prednisone dose was further increased to 75 mg daily to induce remission (see Fig. ).\nA complete clinical remission was achieved over the next 2 months with serum albumin improving to 38 g/L and total cholesterol to 6.3 mmol/L. At this stage he was commenced on oral cyclosporin 100 mg BD as a steroid sparing agent given the previous failed attempt to wean steroids. Over the next 5 months our patient\u2019s prednisone dosage was weaned more slowly. At a dose of 10 mg prednisone daily he suffered a second relapse with recurrence of oedema in association with albuminuria and hypoalbuminaemia to his previous levels. His prednisone dose was increased back to 50 mg daily and then 75 mg daily to re-induce remission.\nGiven his multiple relapses, steroid dependence and initial EM report suggestive of a mesangiopathic process, our patient underwent a second renal biopsy. LM was again normal, however IF found significant mesangial deposits of IgM (2\u20133+) and C3 (2\u20133+) (see Figs. and ). IgM nephropathy was then consider a possible diagnosis.\nThis time our patient took longer to achieve remission, requiring 75 mg prednisone daily and an increase in his cyclosporin dose to 125 mg BD. His prednisone dose was again weaned to 25 mg daily. He also self-ceased his cyclosporin. Our patient was adherent to the recommended prednisone dose as he recognised that without it he would relapse, and he felt further relapses would impact his career progression.\nAfter more than 12 months on prednisone 25 mg daily, and a total of 2 years on continuous corticosteroids, our patient agreed to a slow wean of the corticosteroid dose. Our plan was to use anti-human CD20 (Rituximab) if severe nephrosis recurred. He once again relapsed as soon as his prednisone dose reached 20 mg daily. At this stage his prednisone was increased to 50 mg daily, and he received the first of two planned doses of Rituximab 1 g as an outpatient. He suffered no adverse reactions from the rituximab. During this relapse, his serum albumin reached 10 g/L, 24 h urinary protein was 14.76 g/day and his total cholesterol was 11.5 mmol/L (see Fig. ).\nSeveral days after the rituximab infusion, our patient presented to the Emergency Department with a severe headache, nausea and vomiting. His headache had been progressively worsening since the day prior to his rituximab infusion. There were no focal neurological signs on examination. Computed tomography brain (CTB) and computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed a right transverse sinus thrombosis and non-occlusive posterior sagittal sinus thrombosis. We found no evidence of any inherited or acquired thrombophilia with extensive testing (anti-thrombin 3, factor V Leiden, lupus anticoagulant, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C & S, JAK 2 mutation analysis and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria assay). He was commenced on therapeutic enoxaparin and bridged to warfarin.\nHe went on to receive a second dose of rituximab 1-month later. Since then he has remained in complete remission (see Fig. ). His prednisone was weaned over the following 6 months, and his prednisone was ceased. A repeat CTB and CTA showed resolution of the transverse sinus and posterior sagittal sinus thromboses and a decision was made to stop anti-coagulation. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "An 11-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with microscopic hematuria and nephrotic-range proteinuria detected by school urinary screening. The patient did not have any characteristic features of Fabry\u2019s disease such as angiokeratoma or neuralgia. On admission, her physical examination was unremarkable (body weight 47.4 kg, body height 157.3 cm), and her blood pressure normal (106/60 mmHg). Laboratory investigations revealed hypoproteinemia (serum total protein 5.6 g/dL, serum albumin 2.9 g/dL, serum IgG 318 mg/dL). All other biochemical investigations were within normal limits: blood urea nitrogen 8 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.43 mg/dL, IgA 111 mg/dL, C3 140 mg/dL (normal 84 \u2013 151 mg/dL), C4 26 mg/dL (normal 17 \u2013 40 mg/dL). Anti-hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C antibody, and anti-nuclear antibody were negative. Urinalysis findings were 3+ for occult blood and 3+ for the dipstick protein reaction; her 24-hour urine protein excretion was 2.5 g. Light microscopy analysis of the initial renal biopsy specimen revealed diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibrocellular crescents in 4 of 13 glomeruli (a). Immunofluorescence revealed granular deposits of IgA (3+) and C3 (1+) in the mesangial areas (b), and electron microscopy revealed paramesangial electron-dense deposits. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of severe IgA nephropathy was made. The patient was treated intravenously with three courses of methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg/day) pulse therapy (MPT), followed by 2 years of alternate-day prednisolone (initially 1 mg/kg and then tapered gradually) combined with an angiotensin receptor blocker (telmisartan 1 mg/kg/day). In addition, a tonsillectomy was performed 3 months after MPT. However, microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria persisted.\nAt the age of 13 years, the patient was re-admitted for a second renal biopsy to assess the therapeutic effect. All laboratory investigations were within normal limits: serum total protein 6.3 g/dL, serum albumin 4.0 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 12 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.44 mg/dL, IgA 108 mg/dL, C3 96 mg/dL, C4 26 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed a 2+ value for occult blood and a dipstick protein reaction of 2+; the 24-hour urine protein excretion was 0.5 g. Light microscopy analysis of the second renal biopsy specimen revealed focal segmental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. Immunofluorescence revealed granular deposits of IgA (2+) and C3 (1+) in the mesangial areas, and electron microscopy revealed paramesangial electron-dense deposits. After the second renal biopsy, the patient was additionally treated with three courses of MPT, and her microscopic hematuria disappeared within 6 months.\nAt the age of 15 years, she was admitted for a third renal biopsy. On admission, her physical examination was unremarkable (body weight 55.9 kg, body height 165 cm), and her blood pressure normal (102/70 mmHg). Laboratory investigations were all within normal limits: serum total protein 6.6 g/dL, serum albumin 4.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.48 mg/dL, IgA 135 mg/dL, C3 121 mg/dL, C4 25 mg/dL. Urinalysis was negative for occult blood and the dipstick protein reaction was 2+; her 24-hour urine protein excretion was 0.7 g. Light microscopy analysis of the third renal biopsy specimen revealed minor glomerular abnormalities (a). Immunofluorescence revealed granular deposits of IgA (2+) in the mesangial areas, and electron microscopy revealed paramesangial electron-dense deposits. In addition, numerous myelin-like bodies were first observed in podocytes (b). Low serum \u03b1-galactosidase A activity (13.8 Agal U, cut-off value < 20) and increased GL3 excretion in the urine (0.54 mg/mgCr, control 0.1 \u2013 0.4) were also observed. On the basis of these findings, a final diagnosis of concomitant IgA nephropathy (healing stage) and subclinical Fabry\u2019s disease was made.

    "question": "A 27-year-old female presented to the Gout Clinic of Peking Union Medical College Hospital with recurrent arthritis and infertility. Fourteen years before presentation, she noticed protrusion of her right ankle but did not undergo evaluation at a hospital. Eight years before presentation, at age 19, she experienced acute pain and swelling of her right ankle. The pain resolved spontaneously but recurred 6 to 7 times/year, involving the bilateral metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, bilateral ankles, and right knee. Her serum urate level (SUA) was elevated to 789 \u03bcmol/L. A diagnosis of gout was made, and she was prescribed NSAIDs for pain relief and allopurinol and benzbromarone to lower her urate level. However, she discontinued allopurinol and benzbromarone on her own as these medications triggered acute flares. Five years before presentation, she noticed multiple nodules in her MTP joints, ankles, and fingers. The nodules on her feet interfered with normal walking. She also complained of the inability to conceive after 3 years of attempts. Her age at menarche was 14 years, and her cycles were irregular. She was reported to prefer snacks and fatty food during her childhood. Her father had hypertension. Her grandfather had an SUA level greater than 400 \u03bcmol/L but without gout. On physical examination, the patient was generally healthy, with a height of 168 cm and a weight of 55 kg. Her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal. On abdominal palpation, the liver was enlarged with a normal soft texture. A joint examination revealed multiple nodules on the bilateral MTP1 joints, ankles, and fingers.\nA serological examination after overnight fasting revealed a SUA level of 548 \u03bcmol/L, serum creatinine (Cr) level of 49 \u03bcmol/L, fasting glucose level of 3.6 mmol/L, total triglyceride level of 6.22 mmol/L, and total cholesterol level of 6.60 mmol/L. Her resting lactate level was 7.4 mmol/L. Her 24-h urine urate level was 2.262 mmol/24 h, and her fractional excretion of uric acid (FE-UA) was 2.48 %. Her liver enzymes were normal. The estrogen level and basal body temperature curve were normal for her age and menstrual status. Renal ultrasonography revealed normal kidney size with possible calcium deposits in the bilateral renal medulla. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of her abdomen showed hepatomegaly without nodules. The pelvic ultrasonography and salpingography findings were normal. Serum examinations of her parents and her husband were normal.\nWhole blood DNA was extracted from all four family members (the patient, both parents, and her husband) after signing an informed consent form. A genetic study was first conducted with a target gene sequencing approach. A search of the OMIM, NIH, and PubMed databases using the key words \u201cFEMALE,\u201d \u201cGOUT,\u201d and \u201cHYPERLACTACIDEMIA\u201d indicated familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy, glycogen storage disease type I, and glycogen storage disease type II. Next-generation sequencing was used to sequence each of the exons of the UMOD, RENIN, G6PC, SLC37A4, and GAA genes, as well as two SNP loci (rs2231142 and rs72552713) of ABCG2 found in our previous report of a family including a female with gout.\nThe genetic sequencing results showed that UMOD, RENIN, SLC37A4, GAA and rs72552713 of ABCG2 were all normal in the patient and her family. Sequencing of the G6PC gene revealed composite heterozygous c.190G>T/c.508C>T mutations in the patient, a heterozygous c.190G>T mutation in her father, and a heterozygous c.508C>T mutation in her mother. The genetic analysis of her husband was normal. The c.190G>T mutation was located on exon 1 and encoded a missense mutation of p.V64L, whereas the c.508C>T mutation was located on exon 4 and encoded a nonsense mutation of p.R170X (Fig. ). Sequencing of 50 healthy females and 100 healthy males at the two loci produced normal results. To our knowledge, the c.190G>T mutation has not been reported in previous literature. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 31-year-old black Congolese female patient, P3G3, who had a pregnancy of 38 weeks and four days, was transferred from a district hospital to a tertiary facility in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, for severe preeclampsia with acute on chronic fetal distress. Her past medical history was notable for eclampsia during her first pregnancy in 2011 and preeclampsia in 2013 during her second pregnancy. She had had two cesarean sections for her pregnancies, and she had her antenatal care for her third pregnancy at a referral hospital. She was diagnosed with preeclampsia during her third pregnancy for which she received 250 mg alpha-methyl-dopa twice a day. \u200b\u200bDuring the 30th week of gestation, the patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure became labile, oscillating between 140 and 150 mmHg, despite her antihypertension medication. The patient consulted at a district hospital where she underwent a fetal wellbeing ultrasound which did not find anomalies.\nThe patient was the 7th of 9 children, and her father was hypertensive. She weighed 72 kg for 155 cm, and upon arrival at the authors\u2019 hospital, her blood pressure was 217/152 mmHg. Her heart rate was 101 bpm, her respiratory rate was 24 cpm, and SpO2 was 96% free air. The patient was in pain, she was lucid and coherent, her palpebral conjunctivae were colored, and she had bilateral pitting edema. The fundus height was at 30 cm, the presentation was cephalic, the fetus was bradycardic at 88 bpm, and there were no signs of genital bleeding. The cervix was median, soft, 80% effaced with a 2 cm dilation. Urine deep stick revealed 3+ proteinuria. She had 1.5 mg/dL of creatinine (normal: 0.5\u20131.5 mg/dL), 22 mg/dL of urea (normal: 10\u201350 mg/dL), 15,000 white blood cells/ml, 213,000 platelets/ml and 14 g/dL hemoglobin. Based on these findings, we indicated an emergency cesarean section for acute fetal distress, which resulted in the extraction of a dead infant.\nPostoperative suites were marked on day two by decompensated anemia (hemoglobin at 7.8 mg/dL) for which the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells. On postoperative day three, the patient presented an abdominal effusion, exacerbation of the bilateral pitting edema, blood pressure increase, hematemesis, melena, petechiae, hematuria, and oliguria. Her blood pressure was 215/120 mmHg and she had signs of renal failure (creatinine = 6.9 mg/dL (normal: 0.84\u20131.21 mg/dL); urea 132.5 mg/dL (normal: 5\u201320 mg/dL); hyperkalemia at 6.4 mmol/L (normal: 3.5\u20135 mmol/L); hyponatremia 109 mmol/L (normal: 136\u2013145 mmol/L); hypocalcemia 0.88 mmol/L (normal: 1.12\u20131.32 mmol/L)), and signs of hepatic failure (AST 135 IU/L, normal: < 33 IU/L; ALT 325 IU/L, normal: < 33 IU/L; prothrombin ratio 100% (normal: 80\u2013110%). PTT was 39 s (normal: 24\u201335 s), LDH was 1398 IU/L (normal: 120\u2013280 IU/L), and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (normal: 0-1 mg/dL)). She equally had neutrophilic leukocytosis at 22,180 cells/mm3 and low platelets at 44,000 cells/mm3. Additionally, schistocytes were identified in the peripheral thin smear.\nThe team excluded TTP and HELLP syndrome as possible causes of the postpartum microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). This decision was based on the history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was retained as the final diagnosis, and in the absence of anti-complement therapy, the patient underwent four sessions of hemodialysis. Hypertension was treated with Nicardipine, 5 mg/hr. IV with a 2.5 mg/hr. increase every 15 min without exceeding 15 mg/hr., and the goal was to lower the systolic blood pressure below 160 mmHg. Hyperkalemia was corrected with insulin and glucose (10 units of insulin dose with 25 g of glucose per each 1 mmol/L of potassium above the normal). A favorable clinical and biologic evolution was observed, and the patient was released for outpatient follow-up on postoperative day 18 (Figs. , and ).\nLaboratory tests could not be obtained more frequently due to their financial burden to the patient and her immediate family. The patient had a normal kidney function at postoperative day 160 (urea 24.2 g/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL) and postoperative day 202 (urea 16.9 g/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL). She did not present new episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "question": "A 32-year-old male patient was admitted to the outpatient clinic with complaints of weight gain, dry mouth, and fatigue. In 2002, some eruptions appeared on the skull. Two (2) years later, skin eruptions spread all over his body. At that time, he was diagnosed with psoriasis and prescribed topical clobetasol propionate. He had not been reexamined after that and has been using clobetasol propionate 0.005% routinely for 10 years. He has applied the drug to his arms, legs, and all over the trunk. Over the past year, he put on weight obviously (8 kg). He stopped the treatment 1 month ago, at the time of writing. He has been complaining of dry mouth and fatigue for the last month. On his physical examination, moon face, central adiposity, and purple-red striae on the abdomen under umbilicus were observed. There were scaly patches and erythematous plaques on the skull, interscapular area, sacrum, arms, legs, knees, and elbows []. Other systemic examinations were all normal. Blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg, pulse 75/min, height 1.76 m, weight 77 kg, and body mass index 24.8 kg/m2.

According to these findings, the patient was diagnosed with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome secondary to topical steroid use. For adrenal insufficiency, 20 mg/day hydrocortisone treatment was commenced, and for vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D replacement. As the patient had high blood glucose levels, dyslipidemia, and large waist circumference (101 cm), he was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, and a low-calorie diet and exercise were advised. Metformin treatment at a dose of 2000 mg/day was commenced for glucose regulation. The patient consulted at the dermatology department for his psoriasis, and calcipotriol pomade and emollients were prescribed. One (1) month after that, 1 \u03bcg tetracosactide i.v. was applied and cortisol levels were measured at 30 min and at 60 min. As both measured levels were below 3 \u03bcg/dL, glucocorticoid maintenance treatment was continued. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "The patient is a 28-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of\nhypertension, high serum cholesterol, and gastritis who presented to the emergency\nroom for the evaluation of abdominal pain of 2 days duration. Six months prior, she\nhad similar pain. An upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy at that time showed\npeptic ulcer disease and no other mucosal lesions. The patient had a strong family\nhistory of renal disease and 2 of her siblings required a renal transplant, but she\ndid not know what kidney pathology they had. Her medications included Lisinopril\noral 10 mg tablet daily and Pantoprazole oral 40 mg daily. On presentation at the\nemergency room (ER), her height and weight were 157 cm and 61 kg, respectively, and\nher blood pressure was 206/121 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient had\nepigastric tenderness. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.\nRadiology was ordered to exclude any anatomical abnormality. A computed tomography\nscan showed neither atrophy nor enlargement of the kidneys. She then followed up as\nan outpatient with a nephrologist shortly after her ER visit. Her laboratory work up\nduring that visit revealed the following: nephrotic range proteinuria (9.2 g protein\non 24-hour urine collection; reference range, 0-2.5 g/d), hypoalbuminemia (300\n\u00b5mol/L; reference range, 421-662 \u00b5mol/L), hypoproteinemia (50 g/L; reference range,\n60-80 g/L), elevated serum creatinine (148.5 \u00b5mol/L; reference range, 44-80 \u03bcmol/L),\nhigh chloride (110 mmol/L; reference range, 98-106 mmol/L), and low hemoglobin (100\ng/L; reference range, 120-160 g/L). The lipid profile showed an increased total\ncholesterol level (8.3 mmol/L; reference range, <5.2 mmol/L), elevated\ntriglycerides (3.7 mmol/L; reference range, <1.70 mmol/L), elevated low-density\nlipoprotein fraction (5.9 mmol/L; reference range, <2.6 mmol/L), and decreased\nhigh-density lipoprotein fraction (1.1 mmol/L; reference range, \u22651.55 mmol/L).

    "question": "A 73-yr-old woman with atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency room complaining of chest discomfort, dyspnea, and agitation. The patient had suffered from atrial fibrillation for the last 2 yr. Her medications for the previous 2 yr included diltiazem 90 mg, metoprorol 25 mg, and aspirin 100 mg twice a day. In addition, she had been taking mirtazapine 30 mg, alprazolam 0.25 mg, and zolpidem 10 mg daily for a 6 yr history of dysthymia.\nPhysical examination showed a blood pressure of 100/83 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 beats/min, and a normal body temperature. Her body weight was 62.3 kg, and she was 158 cm in height. Initial laboratory results were unremarkable with a normal PT of 12.3 sec (INR 1.0). Routine chemical studies indicated normal values for total protein (6.6 g/dL), albumin (3.9 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (17 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (10 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (79 U/L), total bilirubin (0.3 mg/dL) blood urea nitrogen (16.4 mg/dL), creatinine (0.6 mg/dL), and electrolytes. Results of hematological studies including complete blood counts were also normal. Mild cardiomegaly was found on the chest radiography. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Echocardiogram revealed mild aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation and left atrial enlargement (45 mm).\nThe patient underwent heparinization with an initial bolus administration of 3,600 IU heparin followed by continuous infusion for 6 days. Then the patient was started on 2 or 3 mg of warfarin daily (16.3 mg/week) to prevent thromboembolism, and was discharged after 3 days with a PT of 37.4 sec (INR 2.81). When she revisited the outpatient clinic after 3 days, her PT was found to be 50.0 sec (INR 3.68). After normalization of the patient's PT with warfarin withdrawal for 3 days, 1 or 2 mg/day (10.5 mg/week) of warfarin was prescribed. The PT after 3 days of treatment was 41.6 sec (INR 3.11). The administration of warfarin dose was changed (6.5-10.5 mg/week) continuously, which resulted in a PT of 20.9-43.1 sec (INR 1.64-3.21). She had to discontinue warfarin therapy temporarily 3 times. The difficulty in finding the optimal treatment dose during the induction period of anticoagulation continued for more than 2 month.\nThe patient continues to receive warfarin therapy at the outpatient clinic monthly and her PT remains within the recommended target therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0), even though her warfarin dose has been reduced to 6.5 mg/week.\nThe patient was genotyped for CYP2C9 after informed consent. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and all 9 exons of the CYP2C9 gene were amplified by PCR (-). The PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISIM BigDye terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.). The patient was found to be an intermediate metabolizer with the genotype of CYP2C9*3/*4 (). What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 35-year-old man diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) eight years ago and treated with intermittent metformin administration visited our clinic. He had a history of a spontaneously healed ureteral stones ten years ago. He was 169.3 cm tall, weighed 51.6 kg, and his body mass index (BMI) was 18 kg/m2. None of his family members had a known history of diabetes. He complained of a warm and painful lesion on his thigh for the last three weeks, but reported no recent history of trauma or injection. Initial physical examination of the painful lesion revealed tenderness and non-pitting edema of the anteromedial right thigh. His blood pressure and body temperature were 120/80 mmHg and 36.4\u2103, respectively. There was no leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 9,190/\u00b5L) and C-reactive protein was normal, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 62 mm/hr. His glycemic control was very poor, with an HbA1c 14.5% and postprandial glucose of 446 mg/dL. Other biochemistry values were as follows: serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 24 mg/dL, potassium 4.6 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.6 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 86 U/L, albumin 4.1 g/dL, and creatinine kinase 436 mg/dL. He had proteinuria (trace) and glycosuria (4+) on urinalysis.\nSerial blood culture showed no evidence of bacterial infection. As infectious causes were thought to be less likely, we conducted arterial and venous doppler ultrasonography of the extremity to exclude vascular problems such as deep vein thrombosis or peripheral artery disease. There was no evidence of vascular structural abnormality, but an ill-defined hyperechoic lesion and thick fluid collection in the right vastus medialis muscle was found. After four days, the amount of fluid increased, and thus fluid aspiration at the intermuscular fascial plane adjacent to the vastus lateralis was done (). The fluid was clear, watery and serous. Gram stain and culture of the fluid were negative. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the right thigh reflected diffuse edema around the vastus medialis with low signal intensity on T1 () and high signal intensity on T2 images (). The three-phase bone scan showed increased blood flow to the right thigh consistent with myonecrosis as shown on the thigh MRI (). The bone scan also revealed increased blood flow at the right medial tibial condyle consistent with an insufficiency fracture, which was subsequently confirmed by X-ray and MRI (). Since these clinical findings and images were highly suggestive of DMI of the right vastus medialis with insufficient fracture of the right tibial condyle, a muscle biopsy was not performed.\nDue to the early onset of disease (age 27), no obesity and no family history of T2D, we needed to clearly identify the exact type of his diabetes. Baseline C-peptide level was very low (0.1 ng/mL) and did not sufficiently rise at 6 min after glucagon stimulation test (0.3 ng/mL). Antinuclear antibodies, and anti-IA2 antibody results were not significant, but antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD Ab) were positive (2.0 U/mL). Other immunologic factors were negative. Considering his age, low BMI, positive anti-GAD Ab, and severely decreased C-peptide level, we diagnosed his diabetes as a case of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). After we examined microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications, he was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and non-proliferative retinopathy of both eyes as well as microalbuminuria based on spot urine analysis (152 \u00b5g/mg Creatinine).\nWhen we evaluated the cause of the insufficiency fracture, we found that his bone mineral density (BMD) was reduced, with T-scores of -3.9 (Z-score -3.3) at L1-L4 and -2.7 (Z-score -2.3) at the femur neck. Due to the young age of the patient, we also evaluated possible etiologies of secondary osteoporosis, including hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism, and glucocorticoid excess. 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-[OH]D) level was also lower than the normal limits (<4 ng/mL, normal range 11.1 to 42.9) and osteocalcin level was slightly decreased (2.4 ng/mL, normal range 2.7 to 11.5). Thyroid function test was normal (free-T4 0.90 ng/dL, normal range 0.77 to 1.94 ng/dL; Thyroid stimulating hormone 2.24 \u00b5U/mL, normal range 0.30 to 4.00 \u00b5U/mL; T3 120 ng/dL, normal range 80 to 200 ng/dL), and there was no significant finding of thyroid autoantibodies. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 19.6 pg/mL (normal range 13 to 54 pg/mL). C-telopeptide level was within normal limits (0.74 ng/mL, normal range 0.07 to 0.78 ng/mL). Testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were also within normal limits (Testosterone 2.19 ng/mL, normal range, 1.8 to 8.96 ng/mL; FSH 4.0 ng/mL, normal range, 2.8 to 9.6 ng/mL), with a slightly low luteinizing hormone level (1.3 ng/mL, normal range, 1.8 to 5.2 ng/mL).\nAntibiotics were initially prescribed, but discontinued when bacterial infection was ruled out and DMI was thought to be the most likely clinical diagnosis. Instead, the patient was treated with analgesics such as acetaminophen, application of a long leg splint and bed rest, and multiple daily injections of insulin for strict glucose control. For his osteoporotic fracture, he was administered oral vitamin D and calcium agents. After about two weeks of supportive management, the tenderness and swelling of the right anteromedial thigh gradually reduced and the patient was able to walk without help, and so the splint was removed. 3 months later, when the hyperglycemia was controlled, we have done the oral glucose tolerance test and calculated the insulinogenic index (IGI, delta insulin 30 min-0 min/delta glucose 30 min-0 min). Calculated IGI was 0 (reference range >0.5), which reflects diminished beta-cell function on glucose stimulation. On follow-up ultrasonography after 6 months, the myonecrosis of the right vastus medialis muscle was dramatically resolved and his HbA1c had improved to 5.7%. In addition, his 25-(OH)D level had risen to 58.7 ng/mL after 6 months of treatment. Five months after treatment, the patient complained of frequent injections, so we changed his insulin regimen to a premixed combination insulin injection twice a day. He is currently under follow-up at the outpatient clinic without any evidence of recurrence. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 43-year old male presented with a history of proteinuria discovered on a routine medical examination in 1985 when he was 22 years old. His medical history was acute pancreatitis at age 17 and hypertension at age 40, and the family history indicated that his nephew had IgA nephropathy. The patient occasionally consumes alcohol, but doesn\u2019t smoke. The patient visited a local doctor and underwent a renal biopsy for suspected active nephritis because of the finding (Table ) of hematuria 3+ protein from pooled urine 0.78 g/day and a plasma creatinine (Cr) level of 1.16 mg/dl [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 71 ml/min/1.73 m2]. Pathologic examination revealed IgA nephropathy with partial cellular crescent formation in 1 of the 12 glomeruli, slight mesangial matrix expansion, and mild atrophy of the renal tubule and interstitium. He was followed up without treatment, and the urinary abnormalities resolved spontaneously. He stopped visiting the hospital 3 years after the first visit because of the repeated negative urine analysis and did not visit any other hospital thereafter. He continued to undergo routine medical examinations, which were intermittently positive for microhematuria and proteinuria. His next visit to a medical institution was in 2002 at 38 years of age and revealed urine protein 2+, urine occult blood 1+, plasma Cr 1.13 mg/dl and hypertension. An angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) was started. After that, he saw a doctor regularly, but hematuria and proteinuria became gradually worse. A relapse of IgA nephropathy was suspected. In March 2009, he was admitted to a hospital for renal biopsy to evaluate the progression of IgA nephropathy.\nThe patient's general condition at the time of hospitalization was height 163.0 cm, weight 55.0 kg, body mass index 20.7 kg/m2, blood pressure 116/72 mmHg, heart rate 83 beats/min and temperature 36.6 \u00b0C. He was lucid with no sign of anemia in the palpebral conjunctiva. No swelling of the throat, abnormal chest auscultation, hard and tender points in the abdominal area or edema of the extremities was observed. Medical examinations (Table ) revealed urine protein 3+ (0.90 g/day), urine occult blood 3+ (RBC 10\u201319/HPF) and serum Cr 1.63 mg/dl.\nRenal biopsy (Fig. ) showed 4 global scleroses, 3 cellular crescent formations and 3 adhesions in 28 glomeruli; moderate expansion of the mesangial matrix; moderate tubular atrophy with mild cell infiltration in the interstitium; and moderate arteriolosclerosis and thickening of interlobular arteries. Immunostaining of IgA confirmed the diagnosis of active chronic-progressive IgA nephropathy.\nAfter admission, the patient was treated with tonsillectomy and steroid pulse therapy. Steroid pulse therapy was given as follows: methylprednisolone was administered continuously at a pulsed dose of 500 mg/day for 3 days, followed by oral prednisolone at a dose of 30 mg continuously for 3 weeks. After completion of the third course, oral prednisolone was initiated at a dose of 30 mg/day every other day after treatment and tapered by 5 mg every 2 months. The after-treatment follow-up was continued for 1 year. The patient underwent tonsillectomy after discharge from the hospital (day 75) and was then followed up at the outpatient clinic. He completed oral prednisolone treatment in approximately a year, but continued taking an ARB during the follow-up period. Clinical remission was achieved 7 months after the initiation of therapy (Table ), and hematuria and proteinuria were no longer observed in this 3-year follow-up period (Fig. ).

The biochemical parameters of the patient who was scheduled for operation under regional anesthesia with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome were as follows; Hb:14.0 mg/dL, Htc:43.0%, Plt:229000/mm3, WBC:6000/mm3, FBG:100 mg/dL, BUN:2817 mg/dL, Creatinine:0.7 mg/dL, AST:20.72 mg/dL, and ALT:12.45 mg/dL. His electrocardiogram (EKC) revealed a HR of 70 bpm with normal sinus rhythm.\nPreoperatively the patient was informed about axillary nerve blockade, and his written informed consent was obtained. He didn\u2019t receive any preoperative premedication, and in the operating room, his standard EKG, peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2), and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) were monitores. Using a 18 G branule a vein on the back of his left hand was punctured, and 0.09%NaCl infusion at a rate of 200 ml/hr was initiated. Right arm to be operated was positioned at 90\u00b0 abduction with the torso, and forearm was flexed 90\u00b0. After cleansing the surgical field with a sterile antibacterial solution, the site was covered with sterile drape, and a single injection was made with a 22 G x 50 mm needle (Stimuplex\u00ae Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Retrograde blood was not observed during negative aspiration.\nUsing a peripheral nerve stimulator (Stimuplex A; B.Braun Melsungen AG, B.Braun Medical AG CH-6021, Germany) at an intensity of 1.5 mA the nerve was localized. When the intensity of the electrical current was reduced to 0.5 mA, nervous stimuli were observed which made us to think that we were on the innervation site of the nerve to be blocked. Then 40 mL anesthetic solution preprepared by anesthesia technician which we thought to be our routinely used mixture i.e. [20 mL 1% lidocaine (2 ampoules of 2% lidocaine, and 10 mL NaCl 0.09%) and 20 mL 1% prilocaine (10 mL 2% prilocaine, and 10 mL0,09% NaCl)] was injected to the patient with negative suctions after each application of 5 mL. Injection site was compressed for 5 minutes. Nearly 10 minutes later the patient felt numbness on his tongue, irritability, restlessness, agitation, he uttered meaningless words, and moved his arms, and legs senselessly. Decreased peripheral oxygen saturation and presence of peripheral cyanosis led us to make an initial diagnosis of methemoglobinemia, and supportive O2 therapy was initiated via oxygen mask at a rate of 6 lt per minute. We couldn\u2019t measure methemoglobin levels because of lack of necessity facilities. Arterial blood gas measurements were as follows. pH: 7.43 pO2:60.1, and pCO2:44.0. Respiratory distress of the patient increased, and deepened, with a drop in his SpO2 to 76, was intubated under 1 mg/kg propofol, 1 \u00b5/kg fentanyl, and 0.5 mg.kg\u22121 rocuronium anesthesia to enjure the patency of his airway. For the post-intubation maitenance of anesthesia 50 oxygen \u2013nitrogen, and 1 mac sevoflurane were used. Following induction of anesthesia, hypotension (NIBP: 60/40 mmHg), and bradycardia (HR:40 bpm) developed which required administration of 0.5 mg atropin, and intermittent IV injections of ephedrine (total dose 30 mg). When his health state was stabilized, NIBP values improved, and his HR dropped to 70 bpm with SpO2: 95%, he was amenable for surgery. At the end of the operation which lasted for nearly half an hour, the patient was awakened with injections of 10 \u00b5g/kg atropine, and 40 \u00b5g/kg neostigmine. Thoughy the patient still continued to articulate meaningless words, and make senseless movements, since he was more cooperative we transferred the patient into the intensive care unit.\nWhen we discerned that in place of 2% lidocaine ampoule which we always requested as a local anesthetic from the pharmacy, 10% lidocaine ampoule was sent, and anesthetic mixture was prepared without checking whether it was 2% lidocaine, we made the diagnosis of local anesthetic intoxication related to wrong formulation of lidocaine rather than methemoglobinemia\nDuring 24-hour monitorization in the intensive care unit his hemodynamic parameters were stable, and his complaints resolved. Then the patient was traansferred to his service with relevant recommendations. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "A 51-year-old gentleman, recently diagnosed to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and systemic hypertension, presented to the cardiology outpatient clinic on 28th July 2016 with history of pricking chest pain and shortness of breath for the past 7 years and recurrent attacks of syncope since the previous year. He weighed 49 kg and with a height of 157 cm; body mass index was 19.88 kg/m2. His blood pressure (BP) was 120/80 mmHg and pulse rate was 78/min and regular in rhythm. He was afebrile. Systemic examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory findings revealed hemoglobin of 15.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 47%, white blood cell count of 11,300/mm3 (differential count of neutrophils of 56%, lymphocytes 26%, eosinophils 11%, and monocytes of 7%), and platelet count of 293,000/mm3. Urine on routine examination showed a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1015, and was negative for albumin, glucose, red blood cells, and pus cells. Blood glucose fasting was 115 mg/dL and post-prandial was 219 mg/dL with an HbA1C of 7.1%. Blood urea was 27 mg/dL and creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, and bicarbonate 28 mEq/L. Serum cholesterol was 183 mg/dL, serum triglyceride 121 mg/dL, and serum uric acid 3.9 mg/dl. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular dimensions, no regional wall motion abnormality, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 69%. Holter monitoring showed occasional supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes. On 2nd August, coronary angiography showed insignificant coronary artery disease with dominant right coronary system and he was discharged with medical advice.\nOn 3rd August, he attended emergency department with complaints of severe back pain, palpitation, and sweating. His back pain was sudden in onset, gradually progressive, throbbing type, rating 8/10 in pain scale, radiating to the left flank, aggravated by exertion, and partially relieved by rest. He had no other complaints. He was on metformin and calcium channel blocker. He looked anxious, agitated, and restless but was oriented and afebrile. His pulse rate was 112/min, respiratory rate was 28/min, and BP was 210/120 mmHg in the right upper limb and 210/100 mmHg over the left upper limb in supine position. There was no radio-femoral delay. Systemic examination was unremarkable except for a mild tenderness in the lumbar region.\nOn investigation, electrocardiography, chest X-ray, complete blood counts, liver function tests, 2D echocardiography, urine analysis, and toxicology screen were all within normal limits. Serum amylase and lipase were normal. Blood urea was 58 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 2 mg/dL. Venous blood gas (VBG) analysis showed a pH of 7.21, bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, base excess of \u22129.4 mmol/L, and a lactate of 10.81 mmol/L. Serum electrolytes were sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 108 mmol/L, and anion gap was 12 mmol/L.\nThe following were considered in the differential diagnosis of this situation: (a) acute mesentric ischemia, (b) aortic dissection (c) hypertensive emergency, and (d) pancreatitis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography abdomen showed a lesion in the left adrenal gland measuring about 3.5 \u00d7 3.2 cm with mild enhancement in the arterial phase, features consistent with pheochromocytoma [: Contrast enhanced CT scan of abdomen showing the mildly enhancing left adrenal mass]. No additional extra-adrenal tumors were seen. There was no evidence of mesenteric ischemia, aortic dissection, or pancreatitis. Upon further questioning his family members, it was known that he was unwell in the previous 6 months with on and off headache, palpitation, and anxiousness, which they attributed to the recently diagnosed diabetes mellitus.\nHis BP was managed with alpha adreno-receptor blocker and calcium channel blocker. Phenoxybenzamine was added at a dose of 10 mg twice a day and later increased to 20 mg three times daily. Persistent tachycardia and BP were stabilized with addition of beta blocker.\nOn 5th August 2016, the level of 24-h urine metanephrines was 14,536 mcg (reference range: less than 350 mcg/24 h) and nor-metanephrines was 7,607 mcg (reference range: less than 600 mcg/24 h).\nLaparoscopic removal of pheochromocytoma was done under general anesthesia on 12th August 2016. After the surgery, there was a brief episode of hypoglycemia and hypotension, which was managed with 25% dextrose and normal saline, respectively. Azotemia resolved and blood gases were normalized. Pathological examination of the resected mass revealed a well-encapsulated tumor of size 5 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm, without hemorrhage. It showed polygonal and round cells with abundant cytoplasm and increased vasculature. There was no capsular or vascular invasion. Tumor cells were seen in the background of spindle cells with ganglion cells and Schwanian stroma. These features were reported as consistent with a CP\u2013ganglioneuroma of the left adrenal gland []. Immunohistochemistry examination showed positivity for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 stains and negativity for calretinin in pheochromocytoma cells. Calretinin, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 stains were positive in the ganglioneuromatous component. Vimentin was positive and cytokeratin was negative. These staining characteristics confirmed the composite nature of the tumor.\nAt the time of discharge, his blood pressure and blood glucose were normal. Upon review on 28th February 2017, his BP was 130/80 mmHg without antihypertensive medicine. Blood glucose fasting was 90 mg/dL and post-prandial 66 mg/dL, with an HbA1C of 6.1% without any antidiabetic medicine. The levels of 24-h urinary metanephrines and normetanephrines were 62 and 604, mcg, respectively. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "question": "A 12-year-old boy, average student of class VII, presented with 1 year history of generalized tonic clinic seizures which lasted for 2-3 min. In the initial 2-3 days of his illness, he had 2-3 seizures daily for which he received carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily. Seizure though was controlled, but he started having carpopedal spasms lasting for 1-2 min. His elder brother aged 16 years also had similar illness. Examination revealed that the patient was of average built and nutrition (height 157.5 cm, weight 48kg) and there were no dysmorphic features. The neurological examination was normal except Trousseau\u2019s sign.\nThe laboratory studies revealed normal hemoglobin and blood counts. His serum calcium was 6 (ionized 4) (normal 8.5-10.8, ionic 4.6-5.3) mg/dl, phosphorus 8 (normal 2.5-4.5) mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 999 U/l, and magnesium 2.2 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 8 mg/dl, and creatinine 0.7 mg/dl. 24-h urinary calcium was 150 (normal 200) mg, phosphorous 0.06 (normal 1) g, and creatinine 1.29 (normal 1-2) g. His calculated TmP/GFR was 2.57 mmol/l (normal 1.15-2.44 mmol/l for 2-15 years age).[] The glomerular filtration rate was 122 ml/min. Serum 25-OH vitamin D was 9.98 (normal 9-47) ng/ml and PTH 335.4 (normal 9-55) pg/ml. His electrocardiogram, electroencephalography, radiograph of hand, feet and pelvis were normal. CT scan revealed bilateral hyperdensity in bilateral caudate, globus pallidus, putamen, and right frontal white matter. Cranial MRI revealed T1 hyperintensity in caudate, globus pallidus, putamen, and dentate nuclei bilaterally. T2 and FLAIR images were normal. He was prescribed calcitrol 0.25 mg twice daily and calcium gluconate 500 mg four times daily without anticonvulsant, on which he was asymptomatic till 1 year follow up.

    "question": "A 26-year-old man with progressive chest pain and respiratory distress was transported\nas an emergency case to our hospital from the local airport. He had just returned to\nJapan from traveling in southeastern Asia for 1 week. He had no relevant past medical\nhistory and was not on medication. He had developed pain in the right lower mandibular\narea over the past week. The pain had progressed from the neck to the chest; he\ndeveloped a high fever during his journey and could not eat or drink. In the emergency\nroom, peripheral oxygen saturation was 95% with receiving oxygen at 15 L/min via an\noxygen mask and a reservoir bag. A chest X-ray showed a slightly widened mediastinum\nwith pleural effusion (). An\nECG revealed widespread ST-elevation (). Physical examination revealed a body mass index of 23.0 kg/m2\n(height 168.0 cm; weight 65.0 kg), blood pressure of 121/68 mmHg, average heart rate of\n110/min, respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, body temperature of 37.9\u00b0C, and\ntenderness and redness in the anterior and bilateral sides of the neck. White blood cell\ncount was 14,510/\u00b5L, neutrophils were 11,320/\u00b5L, red blood cell count\nwas 5.07\u00d7106/\u00b5L, hemoglobin was 14.7 g/dL, and the platelet\ncount was 196,000/\u00b5L. C-reactive protein level was elevated at 54.52 mg/dL (ref.\n0.0\u20130.14 mg/dL). Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were 45 mg/dL (ref.\n8\u201320 mg/dL) and 1.06 mg/dL (ref. 0.65\u20131.07 mg/dL), respectively. Lactate\ndehydrogenase was elevated to 510 U/L (ref. 124\u2013222 U/L). Creatine kinase and\ncreatine kinase-MB were 269 (ref. 59\u2013248 U/L) and 11.6 (ref. 0.0\u201312.0\nU/L), respectively. The fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels were normal. Although\nthese findings indicated the possibility of acute pericarditis, an ECG did not show any\nfindings of pericarditis or myocardial dysfunction. Contrast-enhanced CT images revealed\nthat a large volume of gas had collected in the neck and upper and anterior mediastinum\n(). In addition,\nan abscess had formed in the retropharyngeal, bilateral sub-mandibular, upper\nparatracheal, and mediastinal spaces with pleural effusion and atelectasis in the right\nlower basal lobe (). Thus, DNM induced by odontogenic infection with a right mandibular\nsecond or third molar abscess was highly suspected.\nA multidisciplinary team, including physicians, otolaryngologists, surgeons, and\nintensivists commenced treatment within 2 hours of arrival. He received intravenous 600\nmg clindamycin bid and 4.5 g tazobactam/piperacil-lin hydrate qid. A tracheostomy,\nbilateral neck drainage, neck fasciotomy, and debridement via a cervical incision were\nperformed 5 hours after arrival. The blood culture on admission was negative.\nGram-positive cocci were found in sputum and pus, and Streptococcus\npyogenes, Streptococcus constellatus, Fusobacterium\nnecrophorum, and Peptostreptococcus sp. were found later in\npus culture. Continuous bilateral thoracic drainage began due to the development of a\nbilateral pyothorax. Subsequently, the transcervical mediastinal and right mediastinal\nareas were drained via thoracotomy. His condition improved steadily, and he was\ndischarged without any comorbidities on hospital day 63 after admission. Pathological\nfindings from the excised skeletal muscle and fascia indicated acute inflammation with\nnecrosis (),\nconsistent with necrotizing fasciitis, and a large number of Gram-positive cocci were\nobserved (). Thus, the\nradiological diagnosis of DNM was confirmed histologically and bacteriologically. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "question": "A 66-year-old man (body height, 168 cm; body weight, 88.5 kg) experienced dyspnea, a sensation of chest tightness, and back pain for a few days before he was brought to our hospital on an emergency basis. His symptoms became aggravated suddenly as he was about to get off a taxi on his way home from work. He presented with a history of close contact with a coworker with COVID-19 and was waiting for instructions from a public health center.\nIn the ambulance, the following conditions were documented: Glasgow Coma Scale score, E4V5M6; heart rate, 80/min and irregular; blood pressure, 100/60 mmHg; body temperature, 38.4\u00baC; oxygen saturation, 98% (O2 delivered with reservoir mask at a rate of 15 L/min). On admission, his white blood cell count was 22,300/\u00b5L; hemoglobin, 14.7 g/dL; platelet count, 35 \u00d7 104/\u00b5L; creatinine level, 2.23 mg/dL; creatine kinase level, 2582 IU/L; creatine kinase myocardial band level, 164 ng/mL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 97 mg/dL; high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol level, 19 mg/dL; triglyceride level, 173 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c level, 7.9%; C-reactive protein level, 13.8 mg/dL; troponin T level, 9.640 ng/mL; N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, 11753 pg/mL; procalcitonin level, 0.62 ng/mL; d-dimer level, 16.34 \u00b5g/mL; and soluble fibrin level, 113.1 \u00b5g/mL. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation; ST-elevation in II, III, aVF, and V2\u2013V6 leads; and ST depression in aVR leads (Figure ). Echocardiography revealed severe hypokinesis extending from the anterior wall to the apex and the inferior wall in left ventricle, with an approximate ejection fraction of 20%. We diagnosed STEMI and decided to perform emergency coronary angiography (CAG). A chest radiograph showed infiltrative shadows in both lungs and tracheal intubation was performed in the emergency outpatient unit (Figure ). Continuous infusion of noradrenaline (0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min) was started because his systolic blood pressure dropped below 80 mmHg. After heparin (5,000 U) was administered intravenously, the patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization room.\nCAG was performed by cardiologists, emergency physicians, clinical engineers, nurses, and radiological technologists who donned appropriate personal protective equipment before entering the room. CAG revealed total occlusion of the middle of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD; Figure ). After a loading dose of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, 162 mg; clopidogrel, 300 mg), an intra-aortic balloon pump catheter was inserted, and a 7-Fr guiding catheter was inserted into the left coronary artery. We removed white material, which did not at a first glance appear to be a typical thrombus, with an aspiration catheter, but blood flow did not improve. The onset-to-device time and door-to-device time were 116 and 84 minutes, respectively. Subsequent intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) revealed several structures, which were thought to be thrombi; therefore, we performed plain old balloon angioplasty (Figure ). After the balloon was expanded, blood flow improved slightly in the LAD but not distally. Next, we placed an everolimus-eluting stent (4.0 \u00d7 38 mm) in the middle of the LAD, but peripheral blood flow was still not observed. Repeated IVUS revealed severe stenosis caused by plaque with thrombi. An additional balloon was inflated at the distal site, and a cutting balloon was also used. Another everolimus-eluting stent (2.25 \u00d7 38 mm) was placed at the distal site, but no blood flow improvements were seen angiographically.\nWe moved a double-lumen catheter to the distal LAD and performed CAG from the distal LAD, which revealed retrograde blood flow up to the middle of the LAD and collateral circulation from the septal branch to the RCA. Repeated IVUS examination revealed thrombi and plaque at the distal end of the stent and no intrastent blood flow (Figure ). Then, we tried to perform PCI for the total occlusion of RCA, but it was unsuccessful. At this point, 7 hours passed since the patient entered the cardiac catheterization room, and so we finished the procedure. The levels of activated clotting time during PCI were maintained at 280\u2013310 seconds. After PCI, pathological examination proved the aspirated white material was white thrombi. Chest computed tomography performed after PCI showed ground-glass opacities distributed unevenly in both the lungs, as well as left-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). After the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, he showed pulseless electrical activity, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved with 1 mg of epinephrine and one cycle of CPR. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was considered, but his family decided against it. The blood pressure was maintained through the continuous administration of noradrenaline, dobutamine, and adrenaline. His nasopharyngeal swab was tested with polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19-related pneumonia was diagnosed. Remdesivir treatment was initiated at a dose of 200 mg/day on the 5th day of hospitalization and continued at 100 mg/day. Because of the possibility of concomitant bacterial pneumonia, ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium (9 g/day) was also administered. However, the patient's oxygenation level worsened, and he died on the 7th day. It was difficult to confirm a main cause of death because we were not permitted to dissect patients due to COVID-19. We assumed that he had died from both cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction and septic shock due to covid-19 infection.

You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 17-year-old male presented with a few days history of severe headache, visual disturbances, and a few episodes of vomiting. There was no history of fever, altered consciousness, seizures, or upper or lower limb weakness. The past medical history was unremarkable. At the time of examination, his BP was 240/130 mm Hg. The fundus examination revealed bilateral papilledema with grade 4 hypertensive changes. The neurological examination revealed normal grade 5 power in all four limbs with normally elicited deep tendon reflexes. The sensory examination was unremarkable with normal flexor plantar response bilaterally. Serum electrolytes were normal; kidney function tests were deranged (blood urea 86 mg/dL, serum creatinine 3.7 mg/dL). A renal biopsy revealed features of IgA nephropathy. MRI of the brain revealed a hyperintense signal of medulla and cervical cord on T2 and FLAIR images (Figures ); small hyperintense foci were also noted in the parieto-occipital regions and deep cerebellar white matter. The lesions were also hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (because of T2 shine-through); there was no evidence of restricted diffusion on apparent diffusion co-efficient maps. As there was no clinical or lab evidence to support the diagnosis of encephalomyelitis or acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) as suggested initially by the radiologist, an atypical variant of PRES was considered as the most plausible diagnostic possibility. Further investigations including CSF studies were not considered necessary in view of the strongly suggestive clinical and imaging features. The patient rapidly improved with antihypertensive treatment and a repeat MRI done 1 month afterward showed resolution of the earlier imaging findings.

    "question": "A 63-year-old female on maintenance hemodialysis was admitted to our hospital for an initial generalized tonic seizure suffered at home. Just after admission, a second generalized tonic seizure was observed. During the seizure, conjugate eye deviation toward the upper left was noted. On admission, her pulse rate was 92 beats/min, blood pressure 134/92 mm Hg, and body temperature 36.5\u00b0C. Neither abnormal heart sounds nor rales were noted on auscultation. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no mass lesion, hemorrhage, or infarction (Figures and ). Electroencephalography showed repetition of intermittent high-amplitude irregular slow waves in the right frontal lobe (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with generalized partial seizures. After administration of phenytoin sodium, the seizures resolved, and neurological findings normalized. According to her medical record, she had no history of diabetes mellitus or coronary artery disease, nor any family history of coronary artery disease. She had been stable on maintenance hemodialysis for 32 years, and the appropriate dry weight was maintained. Kt/V (urea) was 1.48. Her administration had included fentanyl patch, etizolam, rabeprazole sodium, celecoxib, lactomin, camostat mesilate, tocopherol nicotinate, acetaminophen, and mecobalamin. On admission, electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal.\nOn the second hospital day, ECG showed inverted T waves and QT prolongation in all leads without chest pain, dyspnea, or any other cardiac symptoms. Neurological findings were normal. Blood test findings were as follows: creatinine, 6.46 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 55 mg/dL; sodium, 141 mEq/L; potassium, 5.3 mEq/L; calcium, 8.9 g/dL; phosphorus, 7.0 mg/dL; hemoglobin, 12.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 19 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 8 IU/L; creatine kinase, 312 IU/L; and cardiac troponin t-test, negative (Troponin T kit; TROP T sensitive, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany: cutoff value is 0.1 ng/mL). Thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) did not show any abnormal findings. Echocardiography demonstrated left apical akinesis. On the third hospital day, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization. While coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries, left ventriculography showed extensive severe hypokinesis in the anteroseptal and apical segments with hyperkinesis in the basal segments (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\nWe followed with serial ECG monitoring for several weeks. Her clinical course of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was uneventful and seizure had not been seen. After two months, left ventricular apical wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography had reversed, and the inverted T waves and QT prolongation on ECG had also resolved ().

    "question": "A 61-year-old Caucasian man presented to the emergency department in autumn with one week of dyspnea, productive cough, myalgia, and fever. He denied any chest pain or hemoptysis. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma with receipt of an allogeneic stem cell transplant 13 years prior. Given prior complications due to graft versus host disease, he was receiving prednisone at a maintenance dose of 15 mg daily for several years. He had multiple documented allergies to penicillin, sulfa drugs, macrolides and fluoroquinolones, with reported reactions including rash, hives, and anaphylaxis. Approximately one week prior to the onset of symptoms, he was traveling in the Midwest United States with his partner and staying in various hotels.\nUpon arrival to the hospital, he was noted to have a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 128/76 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 89% requiring eight liters of supplementary oxygen, and an oral temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F). He was in acute respiratory distress and had evident decreased breath sounds and crackles bilaterally. He was noted to have normal heart sounds without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. He did not have any rash on examination.\nLaboratory investigations revealed a normal peripheral leukocyte count of 10.4 x 109 cells/L (10.4 x 103 cells/\u00b5L) , decreased hemoglobin of 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL), decreased platelet count of 96 x 109 cells/L (96 x 103 cells/\u00b5L), and increased creatinine of 676 \u00b5mol/L (7.65 mg/dL). His liver enzymes were normal. His initial chest radiograph revealed diffuse, bilateral air space opacities in the mid and lower lung zones (Figure ).\nTwo sets of blood cultures were collected and sputum samples were sent for culture as well as stains and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii). A nasopharyngeal sample was collected for respiratory virus PCR testing for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus. In addition, a serum cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCR and Legionella urine antigen were sent. He was empirically started on meropenem, vancomycin, oseltamivir, and intravenous pentamidine.\nDespite initiation of broad spectrum antimicrobials, he continued to deteriorate with increasing oxygen demands, persistent fever, hemodynamic instability, and worsening radiographic infiltrates (Figure ).\nSputum and blood cultures were negative for any bacterial growth; sputum stains and PCR were negative for P. jirovecii. His serum CMV PCR was negative. His nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory virus testing was negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus; however, his Legionella urine antigen was positive.\nAccording to his pharmacy records, he had previously received and tolerated a five-day course of moxifloxacin approximately one year prior to this hospital admission. Given his diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease, intravenous moxifloxacin therapy was initiated. However, shortly following receipt of his first dose of moxifloxacin, he developed an allergic reaction with a generalized, erythematous, maculopapular rash and angioedema, necessitating administration of epinephrine.\nGiven his documented allergies to both fluoroquinolones and macrolides, hemodynamic instability, and concern for poor gastrointestinal absorption of oral antimicrobials, he was subsequently treated with intravenous tigecycline with an initial, loading dose of 100 mg, followed by 50 mg twice daily for a total of 14 days of therapy. Intravenous doxycycline is not readily available in our institution. His oxygen requirements decreased and fever resolved following 48 hours of treatment with tigecycline. All other antimicrobials were discontinued once the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was made. There was no recurrence of infection after three months of follow-up; his repeat chest radiograph showed resolution of his bilateral air space opacities.\nLater in discussion with the North Dakota Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was determined that there was an ongoing outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease associated with five cases over a 13-month period; all cases including our patient had stayed at the same hotel. Subsequent environmental testing of the hotel was negative, but this may have been impacted by a recent deep clean of the hotel\u2019s ventilation system. Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?",

    "question": "The patient, a 22-year-old woman of Chinese Han ethnicity, was admitted for severe edema of the facial region and two lower limbs over 3 mo.\nThe patient developed edema of the facial region and two lower limbs 3 mo ago without obvious cause. Her symptoms were mild in the morning and severe in the afternoon. At the same time, she experienced migratory pain of the small joints, which improved after movement, as well as decreased urinary volume, weakness, and poor appetite.\nThe patient had a free previous medical history.\nThe patient\u2019s temperature was 36.6 \u00b0C, heart rate was 78 bpm, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 122/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation in room air was 98%. The patient was conscious and she complied with the physician's physical examination. Her heart, lungs, and abdomen examinations showed no significant abnormalities, no percussion pain in her kidney area, and severe pitting edema in both lower extremities.\nRoutine urine examination revealed the following: Proteinuria +++, hematuria ++; phase of urinary red blood cells: Deformed erythrocytosis 70%, urine protein quantitation 4.2 g/24 h; urea nitrogen 15.7 mmol/L, and serum creatinine 141.4 \u03bcmol/L. Routine blood test results were as follows: Hemoglobin 92 g/L, white blood cells 4.8 \u00d7 109/L, blood platelets 218 \u00d7 109/L, antinuclear antibody 1:3200, cytoplasmic granules 1:1000, ds-DNA antibody > 1:3200, C3 0.56 g/L, and C4 0.22 g/L.\nPathological results showed 35 glomeruli in the punctured renal tissue, including one with global sclerosis, two with ischemic sclerosis, and the remaining glomeruli with diffuse proliferation of mesangial cells and endothelial cells, accompanied by segmental dual-track formation of a thickened basement membrane, segmental Meyer's loop, leukocyte infiltration, and segmental microthrombus formation. Fuchsinophilic protein deposition can be found at the mesangial region and subepithelial region, including fibrin crescent formation of one cell. The kidney tubular epithelium exhibited granular and vacuolar degeneration, as well as multifocal atrophy. The renal interstitium showed multishaped lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, together with mild thickening of the arteriole wall. Paraffin immunofluorescence revealed: Immunoglobulin (Ig) G (++), IgA (++), IgM (++), C3 (+), fall risk assessment (+), C1q (++), and granular deposition along the mesangial region and capillary wall. Combined with clinical findings, this condition was considered diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, with IV-G (A), AI = 11, and CI = 5. AI was scored as follows: Cellular proliferation (2 points), leukocyte infiltration (1 point), nuclear fragmentation/fibrinoid necrosis (2 points), cell crescent (0 points), Meyer's loop/thrombus (2 points), and interstitial monocyte infiltration (2 points). CI was scored as follows: Sclerosis (2 points), fibrin crescent (0 points), tubular atrophy (2 points), and interstitial fibrosis (2 points) (Figure ).\nAfter consideration of the renal puncture results, oral administration of prednisone was begun at 50 mg/d, and meanwhile, cyclophosphamide was applied through intravenous injection at a dosage of 1.0 g monthly, which lasted for a consecutive 6 mo and was stopped after an accumulative use of 6 g. The serum creatinine fluctuated within an approximate range of 120-160 \u03bcmol/L, and blood albumin fluctuated from approximately 29-35 g/L. Then, the patient began to take AZA 50 mg/d as maintenance treatment but experienced extensive alopecia and shedding of pubic hair on the 13th day after oral administration. Pharyngalgia appeared on the 14th day, and fever with a body temperature up to 42 \u2103 occurred on the 15th day. The patient came to the hospital for the second time. Physical examination revealed the following: Body temperature, 39.4 \u2103; pulse, 92 times/min; breath rate, 22 times/min; blood pressure, 182/100 mmHg. The patient exhibited clear consciousness and emotional distress; she presented scattered chromatosis on her skin, and a rash was found on the inner surface of the bilateral thighs. Pharyngeal congestion was noted, and the breath sounds of the two lungs were clear. The heart rate was 92 times/min. The abdomen was flat, soft, and free from tenderness or rebound tenderness, and there was no liver or spleen involvement. Routine blood work showed the following: Hemoglobin 72 g/L, white blood cell count 1.25 \u00d7 109/L, blood platelet count 13 \u00d7 109/L, lymphocyte ratio 95.7%, neutrophil ratio 1.6%, and neutrophil count 0.01 \u00d7 109/L (Figure ). The results of the bone marrow biopsy were as follows: Myelodysplasia low in the myelogram and focal hyperplasia in bone marrow tissue with active hyperplasia in some areas (Figure ). Routine urinalysis results were as follows: Protein (+), occult blood 2+, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity (3.58 \u00d7 104). TPMT genotyping testing (four single nucleotide polymorphisms, single base extension method) revealed the following: TPMT 3C gene polymorphism (719A>G) (this site is the most common gene mutation site in Asians) test result: A/A; TPMT 3B gene polymorphism (460G>A) test result: G/G; TPMT 2 gene polymorphism (238G>C) test result: G/G; no abnormity was found in any of the above results.

    "question": "A 35-year-old Japanese man with a history of renal disease presented to a dermatology clinic with sudden onset of a purpuric rash on his lower extremities () and was diagnosed with anaphylactoid purpura. Although he was asymptomatic, proteinuria, and haematuria were detected during a screening test when he was 20 years old, and he was diagnosed with IgAN based on renal biopsy. Histopathological examination of renal biopsy specimens revealed mild mesangial proliferation (). Immunohistochemical examination revealed mesangial IgA (), IgG and C3 () depositions, and he was treated with corticosteroids. Thereafter, he moved to our city and continued to be treated here. Corticosteroids treatment was continued for 7 years and was subsequently tapered.\nPhysical examination following the appearance of purpura revealed purpuric rash without any pitting oedema on his legs. Blood pressure was 147/78 mmHg. Urinalysis showed (+++) urinary protein, no urinary glucose, 6\u201310 red blood cells/high power field, urinary protein was 1.4 g/g creatinine (Cr). A peripheral blood smear showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12,100 cells/mm3, red blood cell of 5.16 million cells/mm3, and platelets 192,000 cells/mm3. Serum haemoglobin was 16.6 g/dL and haematocrit 45.4%. Blood chemistry showed total serum protein 7.2 g/dL, serum albumin 4.2 g/dL, serum sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 105 mEq/L, serum Cr 1.35 mg/dL, serum aspartate aminotransferase 21 IU/L, serum alanine aminotransferase 28 IU/L, blood glucose 96 mg/dL, glycosylated haemoglobin 4.8%, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.57 mg/dL. Immunological examination showed an antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer 24 IU/mL, IgG 1095 mg/dL, IgA 315 mg/dL, IgM 133 mg/dL, C3 164 mg/dL, C4 35 mg/dL, and CH50 67.0 U/mL. A month before the appearance of purpura urinalysis revealed (++) protein, absence of haematuria, urinary protein level of 0.73 g/gCr, and serum Cr level of 1.10 mg/dL. Two months thereafter, purpura subsided, and his urinary protein level and serum Cr level were restored to the former levels. Skin biopsy was not performed because his purpura was typical for anaphylactoid purpura.

    "question": "A 66-year-old male, known diabetic for last 1 year was hospitalized with pain in right upper quadrant of abdomen for 20 days and breathlessness at rest for 5 days. No written reports of blood sugar levels were available with patient at the time of admission. On verbal enquiry, he reported that blood sugars were always below 140 mg%. His blood sugars were well-controlled on medical nutrition therapy (diet with low glycemic index). He had never taken any anti-diabetic drugs. During this admission, blood investigations revealed fasting blood sugar of 142 g/dl, white blood cell count of 12700/c.mm, platelets of 48000 lacs/c.mm. Renal profile showed blood urea nitrogen of 33.4 mg/dl, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dl, sodium of 129 meq/l, and potassium of 3.9 meq/l. Liver function tests revealed total bilirubin level of 6.6 mg/dl, direct bilirubin level of 5.8 mg/dl, alanine amino-transferase level of 75 u/l, aspartate amino-transferase level of 103 u/l, alkaline phosphatase level of 202 u/l, total protein level of 5.8 g/dl and albumin level of 2.9 g/dl. Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) and anti Hepatitis C virus (HCV) were negative. Chest X-ray revealed right mid zone pneumonia and ultrasound abdomen was normal. Urine routine revealed 10-12 pus cells/high power field and later urine culture grew Escherichia coli. He was empirically started on i.v. moxifloxacin (400 mg) at admission and was managed symptomatically. Twenty four hours later i.v. cefepime/tazobactum combination was also added based on urine culture sensitivity report. After 16 h of hospitalization patient developed tremors, sweating and was found to have blood glucose level of 58 mg/dl. He was administered 10% dextrose intravenously, which relieved his symptoms. The patient had repeated episodes of hypoglycemia for subsequent 3 days (blood glucose levels 77, 44, 54 mg/dl) despite regular administration of intravenous 10% dextrose. Moxifloxacin was discontinued after 3 days, after it was suspected to cause the hypoglycemia. After stopping moxifloxacin, his blood sugar levels increased after 24 h and he developed hyperglycemia (blood sugars-273, 324, 298 mg/dl) and required insulin treatment. The patient was discharged on recovery after 10 days of hospitalization. At 1 month follow-up, his liver function tests and kidney function tests were normal. He continued to require insulin for glycemic control even 1 month after his discharge. His last blood sugars level was 115 mg% with insulin.

    "question": "The patient was a 45-year-old male with a past medical history of intermittent asthma, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department (ED) via ambulance status post fall in the context of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. Initially in the ED the patient was urinating on the floor, attempting to fight staff members, and uncooperative with examination. Intravenous haloperidol 5 mg and midazolam 4 mg were administered for agitation, after which the patient was able to tolerate medical evaluation and management. Additional history was limited at this time given the patient\u2019s intoxicated state. The patient was unable to participate in a formal review of systems given his altered mental status (AMS). Initial vital signs were blood pressure 146/83 mm Hg, pulse 104 beats per minute, temperature 98.4 \u00b0F, respiratory rate 18 breath per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. Physical examination was grossly normal aside from a 3 cm stellate forehead laceration. Apart from a leukocytosis of 15 K/mm3, complete blood count, and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal limits. Pertinent normal laboratory test results included a sodium of 140 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen of 15, and a creatinine of 0.87 mg/dL. Urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines and PCP. Urinalysis was positive for only bacteria and nitrites along with 6 to 9 epithelial cells per high-power field suggesting possible contamination. Urine cultures were not obtained. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated left zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures without acute intracranial pathology. CT imaging of the patient\u2019s cervical spine did not demonstrate any acute pathology. While in the ED, the patient\u2019s forehead laceration was sutured. The patient was admitted to an inpatient medicine unit for further management of his AMS and facial fracture.\nOn admission, the patient was somnolent, oriented only to self, and unable to engage with the admission assessment. An extensive AMS workup was completed, which included ammonia, vitamin B12 and folate levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone, blood cultures, C-reactive protein, repeat comprehensive metabolic panel/complete blood count, syphilis screen, and repeat head CT. Aside from a mildly elevated C-reactive protein of 2.6 mg/dL and leukocytosis of 14.2 K/mm3 the remainder of the patient\u2019s laboratory test results was within normal limits. Specific laboratory tests of interest pertinent to a delirium workup returned within normal limits as follows: ammonia 15 \u00b5mol/L, thyroid-stimulating hormone 0.4, vitamin B12 576 pg/mL, and folate 22.9 ng/mL. The differential diagnosis for the patient\u2019s AMS remained wide, so he was placed on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol protocol and started on intravenous thiamine as a history of alcohol use could not be ruled out. The patient was also given a 3-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone considering equivocal urinalysis findings. Plastic surgery was consulted and recommended nonemergent elective repair of the facial fractures, but treatment was deferred as the patient remained altered and could not consent to the procedure.\nPer family collateral, the patient worked part-time as a mechanic, lived alone, performed all activities of daily living independently, and did not have any history of neurologic or psychiatric disease. Family was unable to provide any additional information regarding the patient\u2019s substance use. The patient did not receive any additional lorazepam per Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol protocol or for vital sign abnormalities consistent with alcohol withdrawal. Aside from his tachycardia on initial presentation in the ED, the patient did not demonstrate tachycardia after admission to the inpatient medicine unit. On the third hospital day, the patient\u2019s AMS persisted, and neurology was consulted and evaluated the patient for additional causes of encephalopathy.\nOn the consulting neurologist\u2019s initial examination, the patient remained lethargic, oriented only to self, unable to follow complex commands, and hypophonic with increased speech latency. No focal cranial nerve deficit was appreciated; however, the patient exhibited hypertonicity with significant oppositional paratonias in all 4 extremities along with bilaterally upgoing plantar reflexes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) were ordered per neurology recommendations. EEG did not demonstrate epileptiform activity or generalized slowing. However, MRI revealed a restricted diffusion/focal hyperintensity within the splenium of the corpus callosum on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, respectively. MRI findings on FLAIR, DWI, and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) are highlighted in . In consideration of the patient\u2019s recent exposure to neuroleptics, persistent encephalopathy, and significant oppositional paratonias, the possibility of an atypical variant of NMS contributing to the patient\u2019s delirium was likely. Despite the likelihood of atypical NMS, in considering the wide differential diagnosis of callosal lesions the probability of the MRI lesion representing a new infarct remained. Therefore, the patient was placed on standing aspirin 325 mg along with atorvastatin 40 mg daily. CT angiography of the head and neck was completed and was unremarkable. The patient was also started on standing benztropine 1 mg twice daily for atypical NMS. Of note, lorazepam was not used as there was concern for additional central nervous system depression in an already somnolent and delirious patient.\nBy the seventh hospital day, the patient became more alert, had improved orientation, was able to complete 2 step commands with prompting, and had reduced cogwheeling on examination. Additionally, the patient\u2019s leukocytosis had down-trended to 13.2 K/mm3. The scheduled benztropine was also discontinued. The patient did not require any physical restraints or tranquilizers for agitation after admission. The patient\u2019s MRI was repeated 11 days after initial imaging, which redemonstrated the corpus callosum splenium hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and without restricted diffusion on DWI. The patient was instructed to repeat imaging as an outpatient to confirm the diagnosis of subacute callosal infarct versus transient splenial lesion of another etiology. The patient was recommended to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility to further manage his physical deconditioning and was subsequently lost to follow-up.

    "question": "A 58-year-old Thai female patient with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus was infected with HIV 1.5 years ago. She had been taking antiretroviral drugs including tenofovir, emtricitabine, and boosted darunavir thereafter and achieved virological control after 6 months of therapy. Her CD4-positive T-lymphocyte count was 532/mm3 (40%). Her other medications were amlodipine 5 mg/day, enalapril 10 mg/day, fenofibrate 300 mg/day, and metformin 500 mg/day. She gradually developed anorexia, nausea, and fatigue over two weeks' duration. She also noticed a decrease in her daily urine volume and new-onset nocturia together with swelling in both of her legs particularly in the evening. She reported no fever, rash, or joint pain. She denied taking over-the-counter medication or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. On examination, she was alert and had normal vital signs except for mild hypertension (body temperature 37.0\u00b0C, pulse rate 70/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and blood pressure 140/70 mmHg). She also had mildly pale conjunctivae and pitting edema in both of her legs. Laboratory tests showed severe azotemia (BUN 21.4 mmol/L, Cr 1,370 \u00b5mol/L) compared to baselines labs 1 month earlier (Cr 124 \u00b5mol/L). She also had hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated muscle enzyme (sodium 127 mEq/L, potassium 5.5 mEq/L, chloride 94 mEq/L, bicarbonate 10 mEq/L, and creatine phosphokinase 1,904 U/L; normal value 22\u2013165 U/L). Urinalysis revealed isosthenuria, albuminuria, leukocyturia, and microhematuria without dysmorphic RBC (specific gravity 1.010, proteinuria 2+, glucose negative, WBC 3\u20135/hpf, and RBC 20\u201330/hpf). Renal ultrasonography demonstrated normal size but mildly increased parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys without hydroureter or hydronephrosis. AKI was diagnosed. Differential diagnoses of AKI included tenofovir-induced ATN, HIV-associated nephropathy/immune complex glomerulonephritis, and rhabdomyolysis.\nRRT was initiated soon after admission due to uremia and volume overload. After successful insertion of flexible double-cuff PD catheter, automated PD (Homechoice cycler; Baxter) using total dialysate (Dianeal; Baxter) volume of 10 L was started (fill volume of 2 L, five cycles, therapy time 12 hours) on the first day of admission resulting in adequate control of fluid, electrolytes, and acid-base balance. The doses of PD by total weekly Kt/V and total weekly CCr were 3.63 and 91.94 L/week, respectively. Renal biopsy was later performed revealing evidence of acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis (AIN) and ATN without evidence of glomerular or vascular injury. Antiretroviral drugs-induced ATN/AIN was diagnosed. The attending physician then switched antiretroviral regimen to stavudine/lamivudine/boosted darunavir regimen. During fourth week of admission, her urine volume had increased to 0.8\u20131.0 L per day but the measured renal CCr was still low (6.62 mL/min/1.73 m2). She was discharged from the hospital anyway and was prescribed to continue automated PD during night time at home (night intermittent PD; NIPD) at a similar dose (fill volume of 2 L, five cycles, therapy time 12 hours). Eventually, PD was successfully discontinued 9 months after the onset of AKI in August 2014. At that time, her serum Cr was 159 \u00b5mol/L, and measured renal CCr was stable at 17.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 with daily urine volume of 2,480 mL. Afterwards, she remained in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 with stable renal function for another whole year.

    "question": "A 55-year-old previously healthy man from the western province of Sri Lanka was admitted to Colombo South Teaching Hospital (CSTH) 18 h after an HNV bite. He was initially managed in a peripheral hospital and later transferred as he was anuric for 8 h. He also had vomiting and loose stools. Fang marks were seen on the fifth left toe with pain, minimal swelling and two blisters on the dorsum of the foot. The killed snake was identified by the medical officer as an HNV. He was conscious and rational with a pulse rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure 150/100 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 98%. There was no bleeding tendency or neurological manifestations. Bedside whole blood clotting time was less than 20 min on admission to the peripheral hospital and at 18 h when seen at the CSTH. Polyvalent antivenom was not given as it is ineffective in neutralizing HNV toxicity and carry a high risk of side effects.\nInitial investigations revealed, haemoglobin 13.2 g/dl, white cells 13.2 \u00d7 109/L, platelets 68 \u00d7 109/L, serum sodium 143 mmol/L, serum potassium 4.2 mmol/L and serum creatinine 3.2 mg/dl. On the 2nd day, haematological investigations revealed, haemoglobin 10.5 g/dl, white blood cells 14.1 \u00d7 109/L and platelets 58 \u00d7 109/L, whole blood clotting time > 20 min, PT/INR 1.7 (reference range: < 1.1) and APTT 48 s (30\u201340s). Total bilirubin 62.14 \u03bcmol/L (5\u201321) with direct bilirubin 10.08 \u03bcmol/L (< 3.4), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 171 U/L (10\u201340), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 808 U/L (10\u201335), Creatine kinase (CK) 750 U/L (15\u2013105), serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 2370 U/L (230\u2013460) and serum creatinine was 409 \u03bcmol/L (70\u2013120). Blood picture revealed fragmented red cells and thrombocytopenia suggestive of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA). In view of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), he was transfused with fresh frozen plasma with the improvement of INR and APTT. The patient was commenced on haemodialysis due to acute kidney injury (AKI).\nOn the 3rd day, he became tachypneic with de-saturation and blood gases revealed PH 7.21, PCO2 45 mmHg, PO2 31 mmHg HCO3 12.4 mEq/L. He was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation. Bleeding through the endotracheal tube was noted but there was no bleeding from elsewhere. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral alveolar shadowing suggestive of pulmonary haemorrhages (Fig. ). At this time his platelet count was 56 \u00d7 109/L, INR 1.1, APTT 40 s, thrombo-elastometry showed only a deficiency of platelets. Due to the life-threatening nature of the situation, he was commenced on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g pulse therapy daily along with FFP and platelet transfusions. There was a rapid improvement of hypoxia with the resolution of chest x-ray changes during the next 48 h. We discontinued steroid therapy after 3 days as there was no further bleeding and chest x-ray changes were resolving (Fig. ).\nBecause of, persistent TMA as evidenced by a further drop in haemoglobin (8 mg/dl) and platelets (28 \u00d7 109/L) plasmapheresis was commenced and continued for 6 cycles. Despite the effective treatment of TMA, the patient went on to develop dry gangrene of toes on both feet (Fig. ). Renal function did not improve and required long term maintenance haemodialysis. He underwent renal transplantation 11 months after the incident due to end-stage renal disease. Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?",

    "question": "A 16-year-old boy presented with history of vomiting and headache of 15 days duration. On evaluation, he was found to have blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg. He had a history of consumption of anabolic steroids (dexona + dianabol [methandrostenolone] combination) for general body development for a duration of 3 months.\nLaboratory studies revealed a serum creatinine of 2.27 mg/dl, urine protein to creatinine ratio of 6, proteinuria of 4.7 g in 24 h. Urine microscopy showed 10-12 white blood cells and 5-40 red blood cells per high power field. His liver function tests (LFT) were normal. There was no jaundice or evidence of cholestasis. Tests for antibodies to HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. There was no biochemical evidence of a TMA. Ultrasound examination of both kidneys revealed Grade II renal parenchymal changes.\nThe renal biopsy showed global glomerulosclerosis in four of the 15 glomeruli, with the remaining showing mesangial and endocapillary cell proliferation with paramesangial capillary wall thickening. The extra glomerular compartment showed interstitial fibrosis amounting to 20%, aggregates of mononuclear inflammatory cells, tubular atrophy, microcystic dilatation of tubules with hyaline casts and necrotic cells in nonatrophic tubular lumina [].\nThe immunofluorescence (IF) done on two glomeruli revealed arborizing mesangial deposits of IgA (3+), IgG (2+ to 3+) and C3 (2+ to 3+) with extension into the paramesangial capillary walls. There was no staining for IgM, C1q or C4. Electron microscopic examination of seven glomeruli showed abundant paramesangial electron-dense deposits, focally extending subendothelially into peripheral capillary loops. Segmental thinning and splitting of glomerular basement membranes (GBMs) were present, suggestive of primary IgAN. One glomerulus showed segmental [Figures and ] and another showed global collapse with corrugated GBMs and pseudocrescent formation [Figures \u2013], features consistent with CG. Foot process effacement was extensive. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions were absent, in keeping with the patient's negative serology for HIV and other viral infections. There was no evidence of TMA.\nThe final diagnosis was CG associated with IgAN. The patient was treated with oral prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil with therapeutic drug level monitoring and strongly recommended to abstain from further use of body-building drugs. On follow-up after 6 months, the patient has achieved partial remission with proteinuria decreasing to 1.6 g/24 h. But serum creatinine remained high at 2.96 mg/dl.

    "question": "A 70-year-old man was referred to our institution because of abdominal distention and vomiting that started 2 days prior to admission. The patient was undergoing hemodialysis for chronic nephritis, and his past history included hypertension, chronic heart failure, and arterial sclerosis. He was never a smoker and had no history of abdominal surgery or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Upon hospitalization, the patient's blood pressure was 104/57 mm Hg, heart rate was 78 beats/min, and body temperature was 36.5\u00b0C. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness and swelling in the lower abdomen; the bowel sounds were enhanced. No purpura was found, which is characteristic of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura.\nA blood test performed on admission revealed mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL), hypoalbuminemia (2.6 g/dL), mildly elevated C-reactive protein (3.24 mg/dL), and elevated serum creatinine (5.24 mg/dL) levels. The stool culture test results were negative. Tuberculosis and anisakiasis were ruled out by interferon-gamma releasing assays and anisakis antibody tests, respectively.\nAbdominal radiography in the standing position revealed dilatation of the small intestine and air-fluid levels in the intestine (shown in Fig. ); plain computed tomography (CT) showed a stenotic site with wall thickening and dilatation of the small intestine on the oral side from the stenosis (shown in Fig. ). After admission, we inserted an ileus tube to ameliorate the elevated intraluminal pressure. Contrast medium from the tube showed a stricture at the end of the ileum (shown in Fig. ). We conducted TUS using Sonazoid TM and elastography techniques, which demonstrated a thickened wall and unclear stratification of the intestinal wall in the lower right abdomen (shown in Fig. ). The length of stricture was 70 mm, and the minimum lumen diameter was 5 mm. The small intestine on the oral side of the lesion was markedly dilated. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed sufficient mucosal blood flow in the stenotic lesion (Fig. ). Ultrasound elastography revealed lower elasticity of the intestinal lesion site than the elasticity of other intact parts of the small intestine that did not show wall thickening or stenosis (strain ratio [local deformation ratio under slight pressure]: 2.52) (Fig. ). Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with IE. Conservative therapies including fasting and total parenteral nutrition were initiated after the diagnosis; however, the patient's condition did not improve.\nSurgery was performed, and the stenotic lesion was surgically resected. Macroscopic findings of the resected ileum demonstrated circumferential ulceration and stricture. Microscopic findings demonstrated penetration of the surrounding tissue and infiltration of inflammatory cells mainly in the mucosal layer. The venules in the submucosal layer were occluded by hyalinization (shown in Fig. ). Two days after the operation, the patient started oral intake without the recurrence of IE and was discharged from our hospital 1 month later. There was no relapse when the patient was last assessed 1 year postoperatively.

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman from South America with a past medical history of anemia, hypertension, kidney stones, and COVID-19, 4 months prior (a positive antigen test without symptoms) was evaluated in the emergency department after being found to have calcium of 15.7 mg/dL in clinic. The patient endorsed fatigue, night sweats, lightheadedness, nausea, right flank pain with radiation to the right lower quadrant, urinary frequency, diffuse bone pain, constipation for the past 1 month, and weight loss of about 15 lb over the past 6 months. The patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or dysuria. Physical exam was benign except for severe tenderness to palpation over the buttocks and hips.\nLaboratories on admission were significant for calcium 15.9 mg/dL (reference range: 8.6-10.2 mg/dL), creatinine 1.33 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1.20 mg/dL), 1-25 dihydroxyvitamin D 116.0 pg/mL (reference range: 19.9-79.3), and 25 hydroxyvitamin D 21.0 ng/mL (reference range: >30 ng/mL). Parathyroid hormone was low (15.3 pg/mL, reference range: 15.0-65.0), and alkaline phosphatase was within normal limits. Of note, ACE was found to be elevated to 139 U/L (reference range: 14-82 U/L).\nThe patient was hydrated and treated with calcitonin, decreasing her calcium to 11.3 mg/dL and her creatinine to 0.98 mg/dL. On further interviewing of this patient (admission Day 4), it was discovered that she had silicone injections in her buttocks approximately 23 years ago by a local doctor. Her calcium continued to be >11 mg/dL despite in vitro fertilization (IVF) and calcitonin. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of malignancy; however, it was significant for extensive bilateral granulomatous calcifications of the patient\u2019s buttocks. The patient was started on steroid treatment with prednisone 60 mg daily. Ultimately, she was discharged after 5 days (once her calcium decreased to 10.6 mg/dL) and was given a 2-week course of prednisone; on return to clinic 3 weeks later (1 week after completion of her steroid taper), her calcium remained at 10.9 mg/dL. Four months later, this patient\u2019s calcium was found to be only mildly elevated to 10.6 mg/dL ().

    "question": "Between August 2017 and September 2017 in Tehran, a 59-year-old man was brought in the Emergency Department with fever, disorientation, and agitation which had developed over the previous two days. He had also suffered from a three-month period of nausea and abdominal pain along with a progressive weight loss of 17 kg. He had used opium every day for 20 years. His current medication included omeprazole 20 mg daily and ondansetron 4 mg bid.\nOn physical examination, the patient was agitated and disoriented. He had an axillary temperature of 37.4 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, pulse of 100 per minute, and a respiratory rate of 18 per minute. He looked pale. Neurologically, he was awake but disoriented. No other abnormalities were found.\nLaboratory tests showed an elevated urea (50 mg/dl), creatinine (1.7 mg/dl), sodium (153 mmol/L), and leukocytosis of 13000 per mm3 with a shift to left (75% neutrophil, 20% lymphocyte, and 5% mixed cells), a low hemoglobin of 10.3 mg/dl with a mild hypochromic microcytic smear; evaluation for hemolysis was negative. Other metabolic evaluations including glucose were normal. Serum drug screening revealed a positive level for opiates. The brain computerized tomography (CT) scan, electroencephalography (EEG), and his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were normal. As we could not rule out herpetic encephalitis with these data, he was commenced on intravenous acyclovir 750 mg every 12 hours and subcutaneously methadone 5 mg every 12 hours to control opioid withdrawal syndrome as well as providing electrolyte correction. After two days, his consciousness had not changed. Repeated evaluation of CNS, including brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CSF analysis, showed normal results.\nTo further the evaluation of his abdominal pain, the abdominal ultrasound and CT scan were requested which revealed a coarse echo of the liver and a diameter of the portal vein of 13 mm. The upper and lower endoscopy showed gastritis and internal hemorrhoid. The Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was normal. On the third day of admission, he had experienced a tonic-clonic seizure. EEG showed evidence of encephalopathy, but his brain CT scan remained normal. On the fourth day of admission, his gastric secretion changed to coffee-ground appearance. Finally, he had a cardio-pulmonary arrest and passed away. After his death, we received a negative result of his CSF herpes virus (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and his serum lead level showed 98 \u00b5g/dl.

    "question": "A 78-year-old man underwent open surgical repair of Crawford type III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm because its maximal diameter increased from 49 to 60 mm during 2 years of follow-up (). He had no major associated illness except for chronic renal dysfunction, with a serum creatinine concentration of 2.5 mg/dL. Under general anesthesia, the thoracoabdominal aorta was replaced via a left thoracoabdominal incision through the seventh intercostal space. Left femorofemoral partial cardiopulmonary bypass was performed for distal aortic perfusion, and the visceral branches were selectively perfused at the flow rate of 100 mL/min for each branch. As the most distal segment of the thoracic aorta had not experienced aneurysmal changes, the thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta were separately replaced with 2 grafts: a 26-mm tube graft (Gelweave; Vascutek, Inchinnan, UK) for the thoracic aorta and a 26-mm 4-branch graft (Gelweave Coselli, Vascutek) for the abdominal aorta (). The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 63 minutes and the entire operation took 280 minutes.\nThe patient quickly regained consciousness without any neurological deficits and could be extubated at 10 hours after the operation. However, oliguric renal failure developed, necessitating continuous renal replacement therapy, which was changed to intermittent hemodialysis starting on postoperative day (POD) 6. After being transferred to the general ward on POD 7, he had to remain in the hospital because of general weakness and poor oral intake. Postoperative computed tomographic (CT) imaging, which is usually taken before POD 7 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, was deferred for fear of aggravating the patient\u2019s renal dysfunction, which could be reversible. An arteriovenous fistula for dialysis access was made at the left forearm on day 29.\nOn POD 49, the patient developed fever and abdominal pain. After noticing rapidly progressing abdominal distension, CT angiography was immediately performed, and revealed a large amount of retroperitoneal hematoma around the prosthetic graft. Extravasation of the contrast agent was noted (). The branch graft connected to the left renal artery was not visualized. With those findings, the most probable diagnosis was considered to be dehiscence of the left renal artery graft.\nThe patient was directly transferred to the operating room for exploration. In contrast to our interpretation of the CT images, a 2-mm-long linear tear was found at the prosthetic graft at a location in direct contact with a sharp bony spur protruding from the second lumbar vertebral body (). After repairing the tear with a pledget-buttressed 4-0 polypropylene suture in a horizontal mattress manner, a retroperitoneal fat flap was interposed between the graft and the bony spur. The patient stayed in the intensive care unit for 3 more days and then remained hospitalized for 4 months. There was no further event during 2 years of subsequent follow-up. On a retrospective review of the CT images, we confirmed the presence of the vertebral bony spur, which had not drawn any attention from the surgeons and radiologists before the second operation ().\nInformed consent was acquired from the patient.

    "question": "A 68-year-old non-smoking Caucasian man initially transferred from a different hospital for evaluation of a brain lesion found on imaging. The patient has a medical history pertinent to BPH, and his family history was relevant for a father with colon cancer.\nSix months earlier, his primary care physician (PCP) evaluated him for worsening urinary symptoms and subsequently referred him to a urologist. Upon further evaluation, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was normal at 3 ng/mL, and his digital rectal examination was normal, for which a cystoscopy with prostate GreenLight\u2122 (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) enucleation was performed for BPH diagnosis. Five months later and one month before this admission, he discerned progressive worsening of double vision. His PCP examined and referred him to an ophthalmologist, who diagnosed him with third cranial (oculomotor) and sixth cranial (abducens) nerve palsy, which was subsequently confirmed by a neurologist.\nSubsequently, the patient was admitted to the other hospital, and upon admission, he was found to have an acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia. Laboratory studies showed white blood cells of 27 x 10^3/\u00b5L, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 201 K/\u00b5L. His chemistry was pertinent for sodium of 134 mmol/L, potassium of 6.5 mmol/L, chloride of 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate level of 10 mmol/L, a glucose of 159 mg/dL, creatinine of 13 mg/dL, uric acid of 19.6 \u00b5mol/L, chromogranin A of 656 \u00b5g/L, and PSA of 22.67 ng/mL. He received hemodialysis and underwent bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy, after which his AKI resolved. An abdominal CT scan showed findings consistent with diffuse metastatic disease to the lungs, liver, and peritoneum, and brain MRI showed brain lesions. Therefore, he was, subsequently, transferred to our hospital for further care.\nUpon evaluation in our hospital, imaging showed findings consistent with earlier recognized lesions at the other hospital (Figures -). The patient was, therefore, seen by a multidisciplinary team of a neurosurgeon, an ophthalmologist, a medical oncologist, and a radiation oncologist. Biopsies of a perirectal mass showed a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor. The oncologist who saw him diagnosed him with metastatic SCC of the lung; therefore, he was started on one cycle of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy during his hospitalization, which he tolerated well and was discharged home.\nA senior oncologist saw the patient, reviewed all his radiographic images, and questioned the initial diagnosis of lung SCC based on the patient\u2019s clinical presentation of urinary obstruction, hydronephrosis, and AKI. Hence, the original tumor location speculated to be consistent with a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor/SCC originating from the urinary tract. The senior oncologist, therefore, advised cystoscopy for prostate biopsy, which was declined by consulting urologist because the \u201cprostate exam was normal.\u201d Consequently, the senior oncologist sent the patient to a second urologist who performed cystoscopy and informed the patient that everything was normal. The senior oncologist had a thorough discussion to explain the necessity of a meticulous endoscopic urethral examination and prostate biopsy. Subsequently, the patient took the senior oncologist\u2019s advice, went back to the urologist, and underwent a repeat diagnostic cystoscopy. This time, biopsies of the urethra were taken and confirmed a high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. \n \nThe tissue specimen from this case was compared to the patient\u2019s previous perirectal mass biopsy and was found to have similar features. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were negative for CK7, CK20, PSA, and prostate-specific acid phosphatase. Scattered individual cells were positive for nuclear NKX 3.1 and cytoplasmic CK5. Moreover, there was diffuse variable positivity for nuclear p63 with greater than 80% of nuclei were positive for p53 and diffuse strong positivity for CD56, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and synaptophysin (Figure ).\nBased on the clinical history of disease distribution, the pathologist considered the neoplasm to be likely of either prostate or urinary bladder origin. Subsequently, the senior oncologist reviewed the urethral biopsy, remained suspecting the primary site of cancer to be originating from the prostate. Therefore, he advised for prostate biopsy. Finally, the patient underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, which confirmed that all 12 cores were positive for prostate SCC (Figure ). The pathology findings confirmed the senior oncologist\u2019s initial surmise that the metastatic cancer origin was from the genitourinary tract, likely involving prostate extending into the urethra.

    "question": "A 63-year-old male with history of alcoholic cirrhosis, without any significant valve disorder, and without history of drug abuse (MELD score of 13 as of a month ago) presented to the hospital with abdominal pain for the past 3 weeks. He had no prior history of ascites and never underwent a paracentesis. He had multiple admissions in the past for alcohol withdrawal with the most recent hospitalization 3 weeks ago. On examination, he was cachectic, icteric, and had a holosystolic murmur which was heard best at the apex with radiation to the axilla. His abdomen was diffusely tender and distended. There were erythematous, purpuric macules, and papules scattered diffusely on hands, legs, and feet bilaterally ().\nAdmission labs were white blood cell count of 16.8 k/uL, hemoglobin of 10 g/dl, platelets of 292 k/uL, prothrombin time 27.8 s, sodium of 125 mEq/L, potassium of 4.8 mmol/L, urea of 54 mg/dL, creatinine 3.3 mg/dL, bilirubin 9.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 24 U/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) of 76 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 93 U/L, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) 829 U/L, total protein of 7.4 g/dL, albumin of 2.6 g/dL, and INR of 2.3. One month ago, labs were essentially normal, except for a bilirubin of 4.4 mg/dL, and hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL. His current MELD score was 38 points. Paracentesis was performed on the ascitic fluid which showed a cell count of 2000 cells/mm3 with neutrophilic predominance with polymorphonuclear cell count PMN of 700 cells/mm3. The admission lab values are mentioned in .\nPatient was empirically started on Piperacillin and Tazobactam. Patient blood culture revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters and 750 mg of Vancomycin was added 2 days later (given high suspicion of healthcare-associated infection which is defined as infections that develop in less than 48 h after admission or previous exposure to healthcare setting in the preceding 90\u2013180 days).\n Final culture was positive for MSSA. Paracentesis fluid culture revealed MSSA as well. Echocardiogram showed vegetation on the mitral valve 17 mm \u00d7 4 mm (). Antibiotics were changed to cefazolin. The patient was not a candidate for surgery in spite of embolic events due to a high Mayo surgical risk of 40% mortality within 7 days. His kidney function continued to deteriorate. Urine studies showed UNa of 79 mEq/L, U creatinine of 50.2 mg/dL, and FENa of 4.1%. Patient had a daily electrocardiography (EKG) which did not show an AV block. No persistent fever or bacteremia was noted. He had hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) for which he was initially started on octreotide, midodrine, albumin without response, and eventually needed hemodialysis. He was discharged to rehab with long-term intravenous antibiotics for a total of 6 weeks. Patient\u2019s repeat echocardiogram showed improvement in valve function with clearance of vegetation (). Even with the clearance of infection, patient\u2019s clinical course continued to deteriorate with multiple admissions for refractory symptomatic ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, recurrent pleural effusion, acute liver failure and encephalopathy. He was not a candidate for transplantation due to active alcohol abuse within last 6 months. He underwent placement of palliative peritoneal drainage catheter and transferred to tertiary care for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The improved survival seen in patients with HRS from TIPS made us refer him for the same.\n Other factor affecting success from TIPS is pre-TIPS bilirubin which was 2.6 mg/dL in his case.

This occurred on the background of a 6 day history of general unwellness. He was conscious and orientated on arrival but was slightly drowsy. Other than clinical features of dehydration and mild central abdominal adiposity with a waist: hip ratio of 1.04, there were no other significant clinical signs. His random plasma glucose (RPG) on arrival was 59.1 mmol/L. His height was 1.76 meters (m) and weight was 90 kilograms (kg) making the body mass index (BMI) 29.0 kg/m2. The patient was previously fit and well without any known co-morbidities. He was on no regular medication. There was no family history of diabetes or other significant conditions. He was a non-smoker and consumed no alcohol. He works as a farm equipment evaluator. There was no history of specific weight loss over the preceding months. His general practitioner (GP) had performed a fasting plasma glucose test on him in February 2008 which showed a value of 6.4 mmol/L. This was repeated within 2 weeks and the repeated value was 6.1 mmol/L. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was also done and was 6.3%. Subsequent 75 gram (g) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) produced a value of 15.3 mmol/L, 14.1 mmol/L and 7.6 mmol/L 30 minutes, 1-hour and 2-hours post glucose load respectively. He was managed with dietary modification and exercise.\nHis sodium (Na) was 150 mmol/L, potassium (K) 4.6 mmol/L, urea 26.1 mmol/L and creatinine (Cr) 237 micromol/L. Calculated osmolality was 394.4 mOsm/kg. Arterial blood gas sampling (ABG) showed a pH of 7.36, pCO2 4.9 kPa, pO2 11.0 kPa, bicarbonate 20 mmol/L and BE -1 mmol/L. Lactate was mildly elevated at 1.4 mmol/L. \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (\u03b2-OHB) was slightly elevated at 3.67 mmol/L. Repeat HBA1c was 8.1%. Besides a small amount of ketones and glycosuria, urine testing revealed nil else of concern. Full septic screen was done; white cell count (WCC) and differential showed mildly raised WCC at 12.5 \u00d7 109 and neutrophils at 10.9 \u00d7 109 with the rest of differential count being normal, CRP was 4, urine microscopy, culture and sensitivity was normal and chest radiograph was normal. Thyroid function was normal. Lipid profile was also normal.\nThe patient was diagnosed with T2DM based on his presentation, age and absence of anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 65 (Anti-GAD 65), Insulinoma Antigen-2 (IA-2) and Islet Cell (ICA) antibodies. His acute presentation was consistent with hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) and acute renal failure secondary to dehydration. He was treated with intravenous insulin and intensively rehydrated with close attention to electrolyte balance. He improved considerably and renal function normalized. He was started on Metformin 500 mg twice daily (BID) increasing to 1 g BD and Penmix 30 subcutaneous insulin at a dose of 12 units BD increasing to 30 units BD. 5 days after the acute event, a 1 mg intravenous (IV) glucagon stimulation test was done at 9.00 am with blood samples for glucose and C-peptide taken at baseline, 5, 10 and 15 minutes.\nPatient had been fasted for 15 hours overnight and medications were withheld until after the test. The glucose values were 6.3 mmol/L, 15.1 mmol/L, 16.3 mmol/L and 16.6 mmol/L at baseline, 5, 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Corresponding C-peptide values were 0.21 nmol/L, 0.42 nmol/L, 0.47 nmol/L and 0.51 nmol/L respectively. He was finally discharged after 7 days of hospital care with clinic follow up in 2 months. His average capillary blood glucose (CBG) was 6.7 mmol/L and range 6.5-7.7 mmol/L on discharge.

    "question": "A male farmer patient of 53 years old, previously healthy, from the interior of Minas Gerais, Brazil, was admitted to the emergency room with a 6-day history of fever, myalgia, headache, and low back pain that progressively worsened over this period. On admission, he presented jaundice, fever (38 \u00b0C), heart rate of 98 bpm and blood pressure 120 x 70 mmHg. On an initial laboratory workup drew attention the total bilirubin of 13.6 mg/dL (reference range [RR], 0.2-1.4 mg/dL) with direct bilirubin of 6.11 mg/dL (RR; 0.0-0.3) and indirect bilirubin of 7.55 mg/dL, RR; 0.2-1.2 mg/dL), aspartate transaminase [AST] of 10,740 UI/L (RR; 15-37 UI/L) and alanine transaminase [ALT] of 3,120 UI/L (RR; 30-65 UI/L); renal failure (serum creatinine level of 3.21 mg/dL, [RR; 0.7-1.2 mg/dL] and urea of 77 mg/dL, [RR; 0.2-1.4 mg/dL]) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 33,000/mm3, [RR; 13-400x103/mm3]). On the day 7 after admission, a positive molecular test for yellow fever was available. The patient was referred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of an Infectious Disease Referral Hospital because of the worsening clinical status characterized by mental confusion, which progressed to hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, respiratory failure, and bleeding at the puncture sites. An antimicrobial regimen was empirically started with piperacillin/tazobactam, and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (800 mL), lactulose and glycerin enema were administered. The abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of moderate ascites and signs of nephropathy, but the absence of bile ducts\u2019 dilation and signs of chronic fibrosing liver disease. As the clinical course demanded, the patient was started on hemodialysis. Although no microorganism was isolated on cultures, the antibiotics were also empirically changed for meropenem, vancomycin, and polymyxin B due to the suspicion of peritonitis, ascending leukocytosis and severe hypotension requiring vasoactive drugs administration. Despite a normal echocardiography, on the D9 after the ICU admission, the patient unexpectedly presented a Mobitz II second degree AV followed by a total atrioventricular block, cardiogenic shock, and death.

    "question": "An 80-year-old female with no past surgical history was brought into the Emergency Department (ED) of a public teaching hospital with concern for altered mental status. She had a past medical history of atrial fibrillation (for which she was taking apixaban), two prior cerebrovascular accidents, hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and Stage 3 chronic kidney disease with a baseline serum creatinine of 1.3\u20131.5\u202fmg/dL.\nUpon evaluation, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Score of 8 (E(2)V(2)M(4)) and was unable to provide any history. Initial vitals showed a temperature of 97.8\u202f\u00b0F, heart rate of 73\u202fbeats/min, blood pressure of 118/65, respiratory rate of 18\u202fbreaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, her abdomen was distended and diffusely tender to palpation. Laboratory results showed an elevated serum creatinine of 5.0\u202fmg/dL consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI). Serum electrolytes, white blood cell count, serum lactate, and coagulation tests were within normal limits. The patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast, which showed a large dilated loop of proximal jejunum with evidence of mesenteric twist concerning for a closed loop SBO ().\nGiven the patient\u2019s age and medical comorbidities, her estimated American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program intraoperative mortality risk was 19%, and the risk of serious complications was 35% []. However, due to the acute decline in mental status, AKI, and concerning abdominal exam, emergent surgical intervention was recommended to the next of kin. After obtaining consent, we proceeded with an exploratory laparotomy.\nAfter intravenous fluid resuscitation and perioperative antibiotics, the patient underwent general anesthesia and intubation. Upon entering the abdomen, we noted several decompressed loops of small bowel, as well as a dilated loop of jejunum densely adherent to the mesentery of the SMA and transverse colon. We also noted twisting of the mesentery and numerous adhesions of the small bowel to the mesentery, retroperitoneum, and surrounding structures. During our lysis of adhesions, we noted a large mesenteric defect through which a loop of jejunum had become trapped, causing the closed loop SBO. Moreover, the cecum was visualized in the right upper quadrant instead of its usual anatomical location in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (A). It became apparent that the adhesions were in fact Ladd bands (A), and that our patient had an intestinal malrotation. After completely lysing the Ladd bands, we then proceeded with a Ladd procedure for malrotation. We first detorsed the mesentery through counterclockwise rotation. The segment of jejunum involved in the internal hernia appeared viable, so no bowel resection was performed. We then mobilized and rotated the cecum and the ascending and transverse colon towards the left, also performing an appendectomy. After straightening out and relocating the duodenum to the right hemiabdomen, the final position of abdominal contents was consistent with that seen after a completed Ladd procedure (B).\nThe patient\u2019s postoperative course was accompanied by resolution of AKI but complicated by delirium and prolonged ileus. Initial high-volume bilious output from her nasogastric tube prompted a CT scan that showed no evidence of SBO, and confirmed the new position of the cecum on the left (). The patient was discharged following clinical improvement and ability to tolerate a diet. She was seen in clinic two weeks later and reported feeling well, with no obstructive symptoms.

    "question": "A 60-year-old female suffering from frontal lobe epilepsy was presented to our hospital with a mental obtundation.\nWe have treated the patient for a period of 5 years and have registered an electroencephalogram (EEG) with ictal fast activity in the right frontocentral area. A brain MRI showed a T2 high, T1 low signal intensity of a single lesion without enhancement in the right anterior basal frontal lobe white matter (). She used to have partial seizures with a secondary generalization, and she has been on 1,200 mg/day VPA for the last 4 years. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSz) were well controlled, but partial seizures of left head version following left arm clonus occurred one to two times per several months. We added LEV to VPA and increased the daily dosage of LEV to 1,000 mg/day. Her partial motor seizures ceased and her EEG showed normal findings ().\nEight months later, mental obtundation developed insidiously. The neurologic findings showed no ataxia or nystagmus, and routine hematological and biochemical laboratories presented a normal complete blood count (WBC 6,600/mm3, Hb 13.4 g/dL, platelet 168,000/mm), electrolyte (Na 138 mmol/L, K 4.1 mmol/L), renal (BUN 11.1 mg/dL, Creatinine 0.72 mg/dL), and thyroid function test (free T4 1.230 ng/dL, TSH 0.779 uIU/mL). Her creatinine clearance was of 75.6 mL/min. However, her liver function test showed a mild impairment (aspartate aminotransferase 46 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 44 IU/L, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 656 IU/L), and the serum ammonia level was high (154 umol/L, normal: 12 to 47 umol/L). An abdomen computed tomography (CT) with a contrast enhancement showed no remarkable finding, except for a 0.6 cm-sized liver cyst. The blood concentrations of VPA was of 82.4 ug/mL (therapeutic range: 50\u2013100 ug/mL). The EEG presented an intermittent generalized delta slowing (). We suspected the possibility of side effects associated with LEV because she tolerated medication with VPA for 4 years and stopped LEV. Her mental function was gradually restored, with a decrease in the blood ammonia level (56 umol/L), and the generalized slowing disappeared in a follow-up EEG (). We added carbamazepine to treat for partial seizures, and the patient was asymptomatic until the last visit in July 2014.

    "question": "A 35 year old female with SCD, presented with pedal and periorbital edema, distension of abdomen, decreased urine output and dyspnoea on exertion since 1 month. On examination, she was pale, with pulse rate of 100/minute, normal temperature, and blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg. Her abdomen was distended due to moderate ascites however there was no organomegaly/scars. Cardio-respiratory and neurological examination was unremarkable. Ultrasonography showed right kidney, 10.9 \u00d7 6.0 cm, left kidney of 11.4 \u00d7 5.8 cm, with increased echogenicity and maintained cortico-medullary differentiation. Moderate ascites was present.\nOn investigations, urine albumin was 500 mg/24 hours, microscopy showed 30\u201340 pus cells and 3\u20135 granular casts/high power field, urine culture was sterile, serum creatinine, 7.0 mg%, serum proteins, 4.5 gm/dL; serum albumin, 1.8 gm%, serum bilirubin was 0.5 mg/dL, serum alanine amino transferase was 16 units/L, random blood sugar was 87 mg/dL, serum uric acid was 7.5 mg/dL, serum sodium was 134 meq/L and serum potassium, 5.5 meq/L and positive sickling test was noted at 24 hours. Her hemoglobin was 7.1 gm/dL; total leucocyte count was 7,700/cmm with differential count showing neutrophils, 76%, lymphocytes, 20% and eosinophils and monocytes, each, 2%. Peripheral smear showed few crenated and sickled cells with mild hypochromia and anisopoikylocytosis.\nShe was dialyzed and 2 units of packed cells were transfused. Renal biopsy was performed and after paraffin embedding, 3 micrometer sections were taken and stained using Hematoxylin and eosin, Periodic Acid Schiff, Jone's silver methaneamine and Gomori's trichrome stains. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were performed using anti-human IgG, IgM, IgA, C1q, C3, albumin and fibrinogen anti-sera (DAKO, USA). Histopathology revealed one core with 13 glomeruli. All of them were moderately enlarged in size and 11 had exuberant and occasionally circumferential cellular (rarely fibrocellular) crescents occupying 70\u201390% urinary spaces, occasionally replacing capillary tufts and shrinking or pushing the capillary tufts towards vascular poles (Figure ). Capillary tufts had fairly open lumina lined by membranes with occasional reduplication, thickening/rupture. There was uniform moderate mesangial prominence. Capillaries and crescents were infiltrated by few sickle shaped, dysmorphic RBCs, platelet/fibrin thrombi. Afferent and efferent arterioles were filled with sickled RBCs. Bowman capsules were segmentally thickened and occasionally ruptured evoking periglomerular leucocytic reaction. Tubules were moderately degenerated and filled with cellular casts and rarely RBCs. Focal atrophy was also evident. Interstitium was moderately prominent for focal fibrosis and overlying focal mononuclear cellular infiltration with admixed neutrophils. Peri-tubular capillaries were dilated and filled with sickled RBCs (Figure ). At least one medium caliber and two small caliber arteries showed lumina filled with trapped dysmorphic RBCs.\nImmunofluorescence studies showed fine granular fluorescence (+2) across 60\u201380% mesangial regions and adjacent capillaries of all glomeruli on staining with anti-human C3 and (trace/+1) with anti-human IgG, C1q and fibrinogen antisera (Figure ). Subsequently she was investigated for vasculitis and lupus nephritis. Indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA revealed anti-nuclear antibodies, (normal index: <1, test: 8.5), anti-dsDNA antibodies were >200 IU/mL (normal <25 IU/mL, Orgentec, Germany). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were absent. Final diagnosis was made as SCN with DPLN, ISN/RPS class IV-G (A).\nHemoglobin variant study using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (d-10, Biorad, USA) was performed 5 days after transfusion which showed HbSA of 6.9% (Figure ).\nShe was treated with Methylprednisolone 500 mg, intravenously for 3 days and Cyclophosphamide, 500 mg intravenously immediately and dose was repeated after 21 days. Then she was switched over to oral Prednisolone, 40 mg/day. Hemodialysis was done on alternate days for 21 days. At follow-up of 2 months, she is on maintenance dialysis with urine output of less than 400 ml/day.

    "question": "A 42-year-old Saudi male from Jizan, with a comorbidity of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 6 years prior (well controlled by oral antidiabetic agents: metformin 1000 mg twice daily and gliclazide 30 mg once daily), presented with impaired renal function and hematuria. After basic laboratory investigations, kidney biopsy was performed. Histological examination with light microscope revealed a global sclerosed glomeruli, minimal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy []. A diagnosis of glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology was made and treatment with mycophenolate (1 g PO twice daily) and prednisone (20 mg PO once daily) was initiated.\nAfter 3 months, the patient presented with a 3-week history of fever, abdominal pain and fatigue. The fever was subjective, intermittent, associated with chills and rigors, especially at night, and not relieved by paracetamol. The abdominal pain was intermittent, diffuse and colicky in nature and was associated with nausea and vomiting without blood (2\u20133 times/day). During these 3 weeks, the patient's appetite decreased, owing to which he lost 7 kg in weight. In addition, the patient reported a history of animal contact (goat and sheep), ingestion of raw goat milk and swimming in the valley water. There was no history of rash, cough, hemoptysis, jaundice, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, change in urine color, arthralgia, visual disturbances, oral ulcers, genital rash, discharge or contact with tuberculosis patients.\nOn physical examination, the patient was found to be obese, sweating, not jaundiced or cyanosed. He was conscious, alert and oriented to time, place and person. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 38.6\u00b0C; pulse rate, 98 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; blood pressure, 125/85 mmHg; and oxygen saturation, 100% on room air. He was pale, with normal jugular venous pressure and no oral ulcers or thrush. Abdominal examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness and a palpable liver 4 cm below the costal margin with a 15-cm liver span. The rest of the examinations were within normal limits.\nLaboratory investigations on admission revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.65/mcL (neutrophils, 72.1%; lymphocytes, 23.2%; monocytes, 4%; and eosinophils, 0.7%). Results of other hematological examinations were as follows: hemoglobin level, 8.8 g/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 88 mm/h; platelet count, 87,000/mcL; and reticulocyte count, 1.28%. Level of ferritin was 1000 ng/mL, with a transferrin saturation of 11.22 mg/dL. Estimation of electrolytes showed sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 3.2 mEq/L and bicarbonate 25 mmol/L. Liver function tests showed that total protein was 6.1 g/dL, albumin 3.2 g/dL, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, alanine transaminase 71 IU/L, aspartate transaminase 42 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 179 IU/L and gamma-glutamyl transferase 447 IU/L. International normalized ratio was 0.8. Renal function tests showed that blood urea nitrogen was 12 mg/dL and creatinine 2.15 mg/dL. Level of lactate dehydrogenase was 732 U/L and C-reactive protein 53 mg/L. Urine analysis showed 2\u20135 WBCs/high-power field and 10\u201325 red blood cells/high-power field with no nitrites. Sickling test and direct/indirect Coombs test were negative, and the stool test result was normal.\nChest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged liver (16.2-cm liver span) and a mildly enlarged spleen (14 cm in length). Kidneys were normal in size, with a mild increase in the echogenicity of renal parenchyma, but no hydronephrosis or ascites.\nThe serological tests for viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma and Brucella were negative. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome A and B antibodies and cryoglobulin were negative. Malaria smear and blood cultures were also negative.\nThe patient's condition continued to deteriorate and he developed continuous fever of up to 40.5\u00b0C. Repeated tests after 5 days revealed the following: WBC, 1.4/mcL; hemoglobin, 6.7 g/dL; platelet, 55,000/mcL; creatinine, 3.3 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 151 mg/L; total bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase, 460 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 80 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 138 IU/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase, 651 IU/L; albumin, 2.5 g/dL; and lactate dehydrogenase, 1400 U/L.\nBone marrow aspirate showed mild hypocellular marrow with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. Bone marrow culture for Brucella was negative. Further, Leishman-Donovan bodies were not detected by light microscope. Polymerase-chain reaction test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, serological tests for dengue fever and Q fever as well as \u03b2-D-Glucan and galactomannan antigen tests were all negative. Liver biopsy showed granulomatous hepatitis with extramedullary hematopoiesis. After 1 week of admission, the patient was treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotic (meropenem intravenously, 1 g every 8 h for 6 days); however, there was no improvement.\nAdditional serological testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) releveled the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies. Based on this, the patient was started on liposomal amphotericin B course as a treatment for VL (4 mg/kg intravenous on Days 1\u20135, 10, 17, 24, 31 and 38), despite the lack of a definitive diagnosis. After 1 week, the patient improved clinically, the fever subsided, the laboratory parameters began to improve and at the end of liposomal amphotericin B course, all tests returned to normal.

    "question": "A 28-year-old male patient presented with the complaints of generalized weakness and exertional dyspnea of 1 month duration. He did not give a history of frothing of urine, pedal edema, hematuria or breathlessness in the past. Clinically he appeared pale and dehydrated, blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg and systemic examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed that he had normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dl), thrombocytopenia (80,000/cumm) with normal leukocyte count (7400/cumm), moderate renal failure (serum creatinine: 3 mg/dl), normal liver function tests (serum albumin: 4.92 g/dl and serum globulin: 2.4 g/dl), and normal serum electrolytes, serum calcium: 10 mg/dl, serum phosphorous: 4.7 mg/dl and elevated serum uric acid (9.5 mg/dl). Urine examination showed proteinuria 1+ on dipstick, 24 h urine protein was 8504 mg. With a high index of suspicion for a tubular proteinuria, along with a hypo proliferative marrow (reticulocyte productive index: 0.7%), the possibility of plasma cell dyscrasia was considered. Serum protein electrophoresis and urine Bence Jones protein were negative. Serum immunofixation using capillary method showed immunoglobulin G, kappa monoclonal immunoglobulin. Urine electrophoresis showed M band and serum free light chain (SFLC) assay showed a significantly elevated kappa level (4383 mg/l; normal range: 3.3-19.4) with a suppressed lambda level (4.5 mg/l; normal range: 5.7-26.3), kappa/lamba ratio was 974 (normal range in renal failure: 0.37-3.1). Skeletal survey did not show any evidence of lytic lesions. BM biopsy done showed 79% of plasma cells with plasmablastic morphology [], which were CD138 positive with kappa restriction. These atypical cells showed Ki 67% of 20-25% with very few cells positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and CD79a was negative, which suggested plasmablastic myeloma phenotype. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization on BM was negative for del13q14.3, t (11;14), t (4;14), t (14;16). Renal function deteriorated rapidly; he underwent a renal biopsy, which showed pale eosinophilic, Schiff poor fractured casts in the renal tubules [], which were kappa restricted.\nHe was started on chemotherapy, with each 21 days cycle consisting of parenteral bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2/dose on days 1, 4, 8 and 11) and oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1-4, 9-12). After the first cycle of bortezomib and dexamethasone, his renal functions started to improve. He was started on lenalidomide 25 mg/day at cycle 2 (when renal function started to improve) along with bortezomib and dexamethasone. With this intensive chemotherapy, his renal functions improved further (serum creatinine 1.77 mg/dl at 6 weeks).\nPatient was reevaluated after four cycles of chemotherapy with BM examination and free light chain assay. BM showed less than 1% of plasma cells and serum free kappa light chain was 67.69 mg/l. Serum creatinine improved to 1.4 mg/dl at 6 months and he was planned for autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT). However, due to technical delay, he was given additional two cycles of CyBorD chemotherapy (weekly cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone). Patient then underwent APBSCT with Melphalan conditioning 140 mg/m2. Post-transplant patient achieved neutrophil and platelet engraftment on day +9 and did not encounter any infections. Day +100 evaluation showed serum creatinine to be 1.3 mg/dl and he was in stringent complete remission (negative serum and urine immunofixation and normal SFLC ratio).

    "question": "A 52-year-old African American female was brought to the emergency department for generalized abdominal discomfort, altered mental status, diarrhea, fevers and chills for 4-5 days. Her past medical history was significant for alcohol abuse and alcohol-related liver cirrhosis. In the emergency department, vital signs were as follows: Blood pressure of 74/42 mmHg, heart rate of 112 beats/min, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min and temperature of 98.6 F. Remarkable findings on physical examination included jaundice as well as abdominal distention and tenderness to palpation, especially in the right upper quadrant. There was no rash or ulcers. As per family, she did not have recent travels or exposure to sick people. They denied having domestic animals at home or any contact to the patient with pets. She was placed on mechanical ventilation and admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Admission diagnosis was systemic inflammatory response syndrome with sepsis and septic shock with multi-organic dysfunction syndrome, presumptively secondary to community-acquired pneumonia, possible biliary tract infection (ascending cholangitis), probable spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and alcoholic hepatitis. Aggressive intravenous fluids resuscitation with crystalloids along with vasopressors was initiated. Blood, urine, respiratory cultures and Legionella urine antigen were obtained. Empiric intravenous antimicrobial therapy, composed by piperacillin/tazobactam (2.25 g every 8 h) and azithromycin (500 mg every 24 h), was initiated.\nLaboratory results on admission were: A complete blood cell count of 21,000/mm3(90% neutrophils), a platelet count of 51,000/mm3, a sodium level of 127 mEq/L, a potassium level of 5.3 mEq/L, a bicarbonate level of 15 mEq/L and a creatinine level of 6.3 mg/dl. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were 121 and 65 IU/L, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase level was 290 IU/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level was 290 U/L and lactate dehydrogenase level was 482 U/L. Total bilirubin level was 14.5 mg/dl, with a direct bilirubin level of 10.1 mg/dl. Lactic acid level was 6.4 mg/dl. Prothrombine time was 25.2 s, with an INR of 2.29. Serum alcohol level was within the normal limits. Arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.15, a pCO2 of 23, and a pO2 of 132 while the patient was receiving mechanical ventilation with FIO2 of 60%. Chest X-ray showed left lung infiltrate with pleural effusion.\nAfter 24 h of admission, patient remained in critical condition and requiring maximum doses of vasopressors, despite of what it seems to be the appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy. Blood cultures drawn of admission grew P. multocida. Blood culture system Bact-Alert 3D\u00ae was used for the recovery of the organism. No polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed. Isolate was tested sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam and azithromycin. No minimal inhibitory concentrations for these antimicrobials were reported. In spite of all medical efforts, general medical condition deteriorated and patient expired on day 3 of admission.

    "question": "A 78-year-old man visited our emergency room with unconsciousness. According to his family, he was poisoned with pesticide (glyphosate) for self-injury purpose. Two years ago, he had a history of cerebral infarction, and he was taking aspirin and medication for hypertension. During gastric lavage in the local clinic emergency room, his heart rate and respiration decreased. Then, he was transferred to the intensive care unit after intubation.\nIntensive care such as continuous renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation was performed in the intensive care unit, and colistin and minocycline were administered for pneumonia. Pulmonary thromboembolism was confirmed by chest computed tomography (CT), and anticoagulant therapy was performed. Acute acalculous cholecystitis occurred simultaneously, and a percutaneous transhepatic GB drainage tube was inserted.\nAfter 2 months of intensive treatment, the patient's condition improved, and cholecystectomy was planned. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and there were no remarkable details of the surgery.\nOn the first day postoperatively, the drainage changed to bile. The patient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 160/105 mm Hg; pulse rate, 143 beats/min; respiratory rate, 37 breaths/min; and body temperature, 39\u00b0C. There was tenderness and rebound tenderness in the whole abdomen, and CT showed pneumoperitoneum and diffuse fluid collection in the right perihepatic space (Figure ). We diagnosed him as having bile peritonitis, and reoperation was decided.\nOn relaparoscopic examination, there was a large amount of bile juice around the GB bed and perihepatic space, and suction and irrigation were performed. The cystic duct stump was confirmed, but there was no leakage. In the GB bed, a leak was observed in a small duct-like structure, which was regarded as an aberrant duct, and the operation was terminated after primary repair (Figure ).\nUntil 6 days postoperatively, hemoserous fluid was drained from the drainage tube. However, from postoperative day 7, the fluid changed to bile, and a percutaneous drainage (PCD) catheter was inserted into the GB bed area after performing CT.\nOn postoperative day 9, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed, and a leak was detected in the branch of the right posterior hepatic duct, which was regarded as an aberrant subvesical bile duct (Figure ). Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and insertion of an endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) stent (7 French, 5 cm) were performed (Figure ).\nOne month after ERBD stent insertion, ERCP was performed again to confirm that there was no leak, and then, the ERBD stent was removed (Figure ).

    "question": "A 74-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, congestive cardiac failure, permanent atrial fibrillation status-post nodal ablation, and placement of a biventricular pacemaker presented to the hospital with complaints of generalized fatigue. The patient denied other constitutional symptoms including chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. Vitals were as follows: afebrile, blood pressure 116/80, pulse 72, respiratory rate 21, and saturating well on 3 litres/minute nasal cannula. Physical examination showed pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities till knees, decreased bibasilar breath sounds, and jugular venous distension. There was no rash, painful nodes or splinter hemorrhages. Holosystolic murmur was heard at the apex, JVD \u223c18 cm H2O. Laboratory investigations showed normal WBC count, neutrophilia with 17 bands, 26 lymphocytes, and 8 monocytes. CRP was elevated at 4.3. The patient also had a troponin level of 0.22; however, this was found to be chronically elevated. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, but no pulmonary vascular congestion, consolidation, nor effusions. Urinalysis did not show any evidence of infection. Overnight, the patient developed fever with a maximum temperature of 39.2\u00b0C.\nBlood cultures turned positive for Gram-positive rods at which time the patient was started on vancomycin. Echocardiogram was performed due to concerns of endocarditis and showed left ventricular ejection fraction 20\u201325%, severe diffuse hypokinesis, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a 1 mm mobile strand in the left atrium attached to pacer lead concerning vegetation. Final blood cultures revealed Listeria monocytogenes, and two sets of subsequent cultures grew listeria. TEE was not performed as it would not have changed management. The patient was not a surgical candidate for pacemaker removal due to comorbidities and advanced heart failure. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin was continued. Ampicillin was not used due to high sodium content in the infusion in setting of decreased systolic function. The patient received 6 weeks of IV vancomycin followed by oral suppression with amoxicillin. There was appropriate clinical response to the abovementioned treatment with resolution of fever and subjective improvement. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 73-year-old man was referred to the Emergency Department of our University Hospital because of fever, dry cough, and worsening dyspnea after contacts with two sons recently diagnosed with COVID-19. No gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were present. History revealed multimorbidity characterized by type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, multivessel coronary artery disease (requiring repeated percutaneous angioplasty with stenting two years before), and a recent diagnosis of primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma (PCLBCL) leg type, localized at the right leg without extra-nodal involvement, which was treated with local radiotherapy two months before.\nThe presenting clinical and imaging picture suggested a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The patient was severely hypoxemic (paO2/FiO2 less than 100), chest X-ray, and computerized tomography (CT) () revealed bilateral interstitial pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed through polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab, and the patient was admitted to a dedicated COVID-19 area. High flows of oxygen and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) were started, and the patient was stimulated to pronation. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a normal QTc interval. Initial blood analysis showed C-reactive protein 263 mg/L, leukocytosis (16,610/mm3) with neutrophilia (15,940/mm3) and marked lymphocytopenia (260/mm3), ferritin 487 mcg/L, D-dimer 719 mcg/L, fibrinogen 8.91 g/L, LDH 287 U/L, lactate 2.9 mmol/L. Hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and liver enzymes were in the normal range. Lymphocyte subpopulations analysis revealed a marked reduction of CD4+ T-cells (100/mm3). Revision of previous records excluded any prior immunodeficiency. Empirical treatment was started with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg BID (after a loading dose of 400 mg BID for the first 24 hours), lopinavir/ritonavir 100/25 mg BID, methyl-prednisolone 80 mg OD (1 mg/kg) with subsequent tapering, and enoxaparin at therapeutic doses. Overall, the duration of the antiviral and methyl-prednisolone treatments was ten days. After an initial critical phase, the respiratory failure slowly improved so that the patient could be gradually weaned from CPAP from day 14 after admission.\nHowever, on day 18, the patient developed epigastric pain, melena, hypotension, tachycardia, and a substantial drop of hemoglobin levels (from 14.5 to 10.6 g/dL). After hemodynamic stabilization with intravenous fluids and transfusion with two units of red blood cells, an upper endoscopy was performed, which showed multiple large and confluent ulcers in the first and second portions of the duodenum (), suggesting a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) duodenitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the positivity of circulating CMV-DNA (6,080 IU/mL titer) and by duodenal histopathological findings (). CMV serologic test showed positive IgG (154 U/mL; positive \u2265 14 U/mL) and borderline IgM at diagnosis. Helicobacter pylori and Epstein-Barr encoded RNA were not found on the histologic specimens.\nEnoxaparin was immediately stopped, and ganciclovir (5 mg/kg BID) was started. The patient also underwent a CT-scan of the abdomen, which showed pancreatitis with a non-homogeneous pattern of the pancreatic head and peripancreatic fluid collection (). Pancreatic amylases and lipases were only slightly increased (59 and 63 U/L, respectively). The clinical evolution was favorable, as abdominal pain disappeared, and pancreatic enzymes returned within the normal range in few days, allowing early enteral refeeding. The CMV-DNA titer dropped to 1,320 IU/mL after 12 days of treatment with ganciclovir. On day 43 from admission, the patient was successfully discharged by the COVID Unit.

    "question": "We report the case of a 51-year-old Moroccan woman admitted to the cardiovascular intensive care unit after mitral valve replacement surgery. Her medical history was significant for organic mitral disease (mild mitral stenosis and severe regurgitation) with preserved left ventricular function, enlarged left atrium, atrial flutter, irritable bowel, and depression. She had been taking acenocoumarol (4 mg) for the last two years to prevent thromboembolic events. The surgical procedure consisted of valvular replacement surgery with a mechanical prosthesis. No thrombus was detected in the left atrium during the perioperative period. During the weaning of the cardiopulmonary bypass (73 min), the patient exhibited supraventricular tachycardia, which was reduced using amiodarone.\nDuring the postoperative period, the hemodynamics were stable without any inotropic or vasopressor agents, and the cardiac rhythm was regular. In the postoperative stage, the patient received fluids, an intravenous curative dose of unfractionated heparin (UFH), and antalgics. The blood test results are presented in Table . Three days later, the patient reported generalized abdominal pain that spread to the flanks with hematuria, constipation, and vomiting. Physical examination showed the following vital signs: body temperature, 37.2\u00b0C; blood pressure, 110/78 mmHg; heart rate, 77 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; and swollen abdomen with a slight stiffness in the renal angles. The rest of the examination results were normal.\nPyelonephritis or mesenteric ischemia was strongly suspected as the cause of her acute pain. The workup revealed high serum creatinine levels, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, high leukocytosis, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Urine analysis showed macroscopic hematuria and aseptic leukocytosis. An abdominal CT scan without contrast showed fecal impaction and infiltration of perirenal fat. Duplex Doppler ultrasound showed aspects of bilateral multifocal cortical renal infarctions (Figure ), which suggested arterial thromboembolic disease.\nThe aorta and renal arteries were permeable with no atherosclerotic plaques. Both the renal vein and inferior vena cava were permeable. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed neither intracardiac nor valvular prosthesis thrombus or endocarditis vegetation. The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 38% with elevated left ventricular filling pressure. The systolic pulmonary arterial pressure was approximately 46 mmHg.\nWe concluded that it was a bilateral renal infarction of probable embolic origin, despite curative heparin. A progressive increase was observed in serum creatinine levels up to 70 mg/L after four days. The urine output up to now was preserved. One month later, the creatinine level increased to 95 mg/L, and the patient was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 70-year-old male patient presented himself to the emergency department due to having had productive cough for one week. He has a past history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage III chronic kidney disease, hypertension, old pulmonary tuberculosis, and poliomyelitis. He also received a mechanical valve replacement for severe tricuspid regurgitation and has been taking warfarin for 10 years. He was admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, and received amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.\nOn the second day after admission, the patient developed massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding with a remarkable decrease of hemoglobin from 11.1 g/dL to 7.6 g/dL. He had a profound coagulopathy with prothrombin time (PT) of 43.4 s, international normalized ratio (INR) of 4.07, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 63.2 s. The platelet count was 252,000/\u03bcL. Warfarin was discontinued. He received blood component therapy and Vitamin K1 to correct anemia and coagulopathy. He also received intravenous esomeprazole. The panendoscopic examination showed an ulcer on the duodenal bulb with an active oozing vessel on the ulcer crater (Fig. -). Hemostasis was performed with epinephrine injection and hemoclipping (Fig. -).\nThe patient had abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension one day after the endoscopic procedure. Hemoglobin was further dropped to 5.8 g/dL, and coagulopathy was worsened with PT of 60.4 s, INR of 5.69, and aPTT of 60.1 s despite of aggressive component therapy. Total serum bilirubin level was rapidly elevated from 1.68 mg/dL to 6.00 mg/dL. Acute pancreatitis was also suspected with a lipase level of 3743 IU/L. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a 14.4 cm \u00d7 7 cm intramural hematoma at the second portion of duodenum (Fig. -). The stomach was distended which indicated gastric outlet obstruction. He also had air retention in the portal vein and wall of esophagus, stomach and bulb (Fig. - to ).\nThe patient developed respiratory failure and shock, and he received support with mechanical ventilation. His bleeding tendency was corrected by vitamin K1 and blood component therapy. Hemodynamic instability was promptly resolved within two days. Abdominal ultrasonography taken six days later showed the finding of complete resolution of the duodenal hematoma, and was confirmed with endoscopy two weeks later (Fig. ). But, his renal function was progressively worsened, and the patient and his family declined hemodialysis therapy. The patient died of renal failure on the 40th day after admission.\nDepending on the involved site of gastrointestinal tract, clinical presentation of PI is usually nonspecific, varying from chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, to gastrointestinal bleeding, or even no symptom [, , ].\nGastric pneumatosis has been described in various circumstances, including patients who have hemorrhagic radiation gastritis after Argon plasma coagulation [], gastric ulcer [], corrosive injury of stomach, status post endoscopy, gastric outlet obstruction, duodenal obstruction, nasogastric tube placement [], hepatectomy with vascular reconstruction, obstructive pulmonary disease with bleb rupture [], and high-dose dexamethasone therapy []. It can be divided into two categories: first, gastric emphysema, implying benign condition and usually being managed by conservative treatment; and second, emphysematous gastritis, suggesting emergent condition, and surgical intervention being critical for life-saving. Mclaughlin et al. have proposed to use the term gangrenous PI/nongangrenous PI instead of emphysematous gastritis/gastric emphysema, to avoid misleading [].\nIDH is also a rare condition that mostly occurs after a blunt abdominal trauma because that the duodenum has rich submucosal vascular supply and is fixed in retroperitoneum []. IDH has also been reported as clinical finding associated with anticoagulant therapy, blood dyscrasia, pancreatic disease, collagen vascular disease [], and diagnostic/therapeutic endoscopy [] such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and biliary stone retrieval []. It tends to occur in patients with liver cirrhosis, coagulopathy and hemodialysis especially []. IDH is usually confined from the first portion to the second portion of the duodenum due to the barrier of pylorus and ligament of Treitz. Typical symptoms of IDH include epigastric pain, vomiting, and hematochezia. Acute pancreatitis is the most frequent comorbidity in those patients []. Thandassery et al. reported a rare case in a patient who developed intramural duodenal hematoma after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and biliary stone extraction with subsequent of acute pancreatitis, biliary and gastric outlet obstruction after ERCP []. Our patient also had the triad of above symptoms. We also observed rapid decline of hemoglobin level in our patient and this observation has been described in other case reports [, ]. We suggest that the patients should be suspected to have IHD if they have the tetrad of acute pancreatitis, biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction and rapid decline of hemoglobin after an endoscopic examination.\nIn uncomplicated cases, IDH usually resolves spontaneously with conservative treatment in 1\u20133 weeks []. Sadio et al. have reported a case in a patient with intramural gastric hematoma after endoscopic injection therapy, and have found that patient\u2019s hematoma disappear six days later []. In our patient, the IDH was spontaneously resolved under abdominal sonography six days after the endoscopy.\nTo our best knowledge, less than 10 cases of patients with esophageal pneumatosis have been reported [, ], and no esophagogastroduodenal pneumatosis has been reported. The mechanism of PI has been experimentally proved that dissection of the gas from intraluminal to the intramural compartment is due to increased intra-abdominal pressure combined with mucosal defect []. We hypothesize that the findings of our patient are derived from the similar mechanism. The air was inflated from the defect of the needle injection site after endoscopic hemostasis for duodenal ulcer hemorrhage, and warfarin-associated coagulopathy precipitated the formation of IDH, which further dissected the duodenal wall, leading to inflated air entering into the duodenal, gastric and esophageal wall. The inflated air finally entered the portal vein through the portal circulation system.\nTraditionally, once the pneumoporta is recognized along with PI, surgical intervention is preferred due to the concern of having ischemic bowel. But, PI is a radiological finding with wide spectrum of clinical severity and outcome. Surgical or conservative treatment should be considered according to the underlying etiology []. In this patient, esophagogastroduodenal pneumatosis and intramural duodenal hematoma were resolved spontaneously six days later. Therefore, we suggest that conservative treatment and close clinical assessment should be considered as an initial management for patients who complicate with IDH and PI after an endoscopic procedure. But, surgery is needed for those patients if the diseases progress or complications persist. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "We present a case of a 79-year-old independent female who was referred to our breast unit with a left breast lump. Her past medical history included bilateral implant-based breast augmentation in 1970, hypertension, myocardial infarction in 1979 and 1982, coronary stents, atrioventricular (AV) node ablation, and atrial fibrillation (AF). There was no relevant family history, and the general examination was unremarkable. Breast examination revealed bilateral hard 50 mm masses in each breast's centre, denoting grade IV capsular contracture (as per Baker scale []) and likely failed breast implants, with no other palpable suspicious lumps or axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.\nBilateral mammogram and ultrasound scan showed an impalpable, right breast, 10 mm, suspicious mass, which was cored and clipped under ultrasound scan guidance. They also showed bilateral failed collapsed breast implants (Figures -).\nAfter discussing her care in our multidisciplinary meeting, we preceded with right breast radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag-guided wide local excision (Figure ), patent blue and radioactive directed sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and bilateral explantation surrounded by a rim of normal breast tissue (Figure ).\nThe patient had smooth postoperative recovery and was discharged the following day, seen in the clinic the following week with good aesthetic results and no postoperative complications were noted.\nFinal histology revealed a fully excised, right breast, 17 mm, invasive ductal carcinoma, grade II, with intermediate-grade solid and comedo ductal carcinoma in situ, estrogen receptors (ER) 8, progesterone receptors (PR) 8 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, and SLNB 0/2. The bilateral collapsed implants showed an extensively calcified capsule lined by a band of dense hyaline fibrous tissue showing patchy dystrophic calcification, with mild chronic inflammation, occasional foreign body giant cells, and fat necrosis noted but no evidence of Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL).

    "question": "An 81-year-old right-handed male presented with acute onset of sound volume loss, inability to swallow and speak, inability to move tongue, and difficulties in chewing the foods. The past medical history was remarkable for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and benign prostate hypertrophy. His first cerebral vascular event presenting with right-sided arm and leg weakness was observed about 4 years ago and his weakness was recovered completely. However, he has not used suggested antiplatelet treatment up to now. The family history was unremarkable.\nIn neurological assessment, he was aphonic, but his verbal and reading perception was normal. He was able to answer the questions with signs and writing. The pupillary, corneal reflexes, and extraocular movements were intact. The left nasolabial sulcus disappeared. He was not able to open the mouth, protrude the tongue, show the teeth, whistle, chew, and swallow. The tongue was on the midline and immobile. No tongue atrophy, fibrillation, and deviation were observed. The taste sensation was intact. Palatal, laryngeal, blink, and gag reflexes, spontaneous smiling, and yawning were protected. The upper and lower limbs muscles strengths were 5/5. Deep tendon reflex was normoactive. Babinski response was absent. Extrapyramidal, coordination, and sensory examinations were normal. No vocal cord paralysis was detected on the laryngoscopic examination. The laboratory investigation including liver and kidney function, complete cell count, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biatrial dilatation, mild calcification of mitral and aortic valves, and mild aortic and mitral valves insufficiency. A doppler ultrasonography of carotid and vertebral arteries was unremarkable. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain indicated right frontal opercular acute infarct with 3.3 \u00d7 2.6 cm on dimensions () and bilateral chronic inferior frontal gyrus infarct (). He was treated with 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid daily and was placed nasogastric tube for feeding due to lack of swallowing function.

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman with the following characteristics was posted for emergency caesarean delivery in view of intra-uterine growth retardation and foetal tachycardia: Second gravida at 35 weeks of gestation with TA, AR and hypertension for 5 years, on treatment with tablet methyldopa 500 mg, amlodipine 5 mg and extended release metoprolol 50 mg, each, twice daily.\nHer pulse rate was 114/min and BP was 183/78 mmHg in right arm supine position. Volume of upper limb pulses appeared to be bilaterally equal on palpation. However, right radial pulse was collapsing in nature along with radio-femoral delay. Grade four early diastolic murmur, loudest in aortic area, with palpable thrill-radiating to left sternal border was present. Examination of other systems and investigations were unremarkable. Two dimensional (2D) echocardiogram revealed narrowing of thoracic and abdominal aorta to 9 mm with a high blood flow velocity of 2.0 m/s. Ascending aorta and aortic arch were dilated along with moderate AR. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 58% with normal biventricular systolic function and normal pulmonary artery pressure. Doppler performed 5 years back showed high resistant flows in common, internal and external carotid arteries bilaterally, with possible proximal stenosis of right subclavian artery (SCA).\nBaseline vitals in the operating room were as follows: Heart rate of 115/min, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) of 188/78 mmHg in right upper limb and SPO2 of 97% [].\nAnaesthetic plan was lumbar epidural anaesthesia with invasive radial arterial BP monitoring prior to placing the epidural. Since the doppler report showed possible stenosis of right SCA, left radial arterial line was secured and the invasive BP (IBP) was 112/55 mmHg. Lower limb arterial monitoring was not considered due to narrowing of thoraco-abdominal aorta. Epidural catheter was secured in L1-L2 intervertebral space, and the position was confirmed with test dose of 3 ml of 2% preservative free lignocaine. Patient was positioned supine with a wedge under the right buttock. To achieve a sensory block up to T6 level, 10 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was given in 5-ml increments every 10 minutes. There was a drop in IBP to 80/40 mmHg along with a drop of NIBP to 122/60 mmHg after the epidural over 10 minutes. We treated the drop in IBP with 6 mg ephedrine boluses to avoid any cerebral or utero-placental hypoperfusion. There was ill-sustained increase in IBP and NIBP after each bolus (3 boluses provided). BP increased up to 122/64 mmHg, while the NIBP increased up to 198/94 mmHg after the third bolus of ephedrine. Patient complained of headache after each bolus of ephedrine. Possibility of over treating IBP leading to headache was considered after ruling out possibilities of monitoring error. On-table doppler ultrasound of upper limb arteries was performed specifically looking at the luminal diameter and amplitude of pulsations. Both were reduced in the left radial and axillary artery when compared to the right radial and axillary artery. Right radial pulsation was collapsing in nature, which is expected in AR. Thereafter, we considered treating using the NIBP values of the right upper limb. Meanwhile, the baby delivered was shifted to neonatal intensive care unit in view of prematurity. Rest of the intra-operative period was uneventful. Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in a high dependency unit. Post-operative aortogram revealed normal right SCA and diffuse disease of the left distal SCA, which confirmed our intra-operative findings. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 78-year-old Caucasian woman with no known past medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of bilateral lower extremity edema and erythema with a clear serous discharge. The patient first noticed some small blisters on her left lower extremity which subsequently opened with some clear serous drainage. She also experienced progressively worsening swelling first of the left lower extremity and then her right lower extremity which prompted her to come into the hospital. Except for a cough, the patient had no other symptoms.\nPreliminary evaluation at the emergency department indicated the patient had cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions with a BNP of 1260. She also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was not complaining of any chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Her chest x-ray showed evidence of cardiac enlargement with interstitial densities and bilateral air-space processes possibly associated with asymmetric pulmonary edema. Large bilateral pleural effusions were noted, with the left greater than the right side. Incidentally, some evidence indicating a compression fracture of indeterminate age involving the upper lumbar/lower dorsal spine was observed.\nThe patient had no known medical history. In fact, she had not been seen by a physician for the last 15 years. Besides taking aspirin occasionally, she was not on any medications. She did not use alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs. Physical examination did not reveal any specific concerns other than bilateral lower extremity edema.\nCT angiogram of the chest showed large bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe enhancing volume loss and worse on the left. Cardiomegaly was noted and there was no evidence for a pulmonary embolus. In addition, there was no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the venous Doppler studies of her lower extremities bilaterally.\nEchocardiogram indicated the left ventricle with some mild hypertrophy. Systolic function was normal with an ejection fraction estimated at about 60%. The right ventricle was mildly enlarged and mildly hypokinetic. The left atrium showed marked enlargement and the right atrium was moderately enlarged as well. The aortic valve was mildly sclerotic and trileaflet. The pulmonic valve was unremarkable. The mitral valve showed flail motion of the posterior leaflet and there was a small mobile echo seen in the left atrium which strongly indicated endocarditis as the cause for pulmonary edema. Doppler examination showed severe mitral regurgitation that tracked underneath the anterior leaflet along the interatrial septum. There was mild aortic insufficiency. The inferior vena cava was dilated indicating elevated right atrial pressure and the pulmonary systolic pressure was estimated at about 50 mmHg.\nGram positive cocci in diploids, tetrads, and clusters were isolated from three sets of blood cultures. The organism was catalase positive and produced a negative coagulase reaction by SlidexTM (BioM\u00e9rieux, NC). The Vitek 2 GP card (BioM\u00e9rieux, MO) identified the bacterium as Staphylococcus warneri. It produced acid from trehalose and lacked phosphatase enzyme, two key characteristics that differentiate this species from S. epidermidis - one of the most recognized CoNS [].\nThe patient was initially treated with Unasyn, 3 grams IV every 6 hours for presumed bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. After the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis was made and supported by the echo-cardiographic results, the patient was started on nafcillin with gentamicin following consultation with the infectious diseases specialist. In addition, congestive heart failure was treated initially with lasix IV and subsequently with lasix orally. Atrial fibrillation was rate controlled with diltiazem. Gentamicin was later discontinued due to acute renal failure, and the patient was discharged with a PICC line for treatment with 2 grams Nafcillin intravenously every 4 hours for a total of 6 weeks. Repeat blood cultures were negative for 48 hours prior to discharge. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 75-year-old right-handed woman was admitted because of the abrupt development of mental confusion, left hemiparesis, and dysarthria. She was previously healthy. One day before admission, she developed weakness in her left arm and disorientation, followed 20 hours later by inappropriate speech, agitation, and dysarthria. She had a history of hypertension and diabetes, but no history of psychiatric illness. She had no family history of affective illness.\nOn admission, she showed partially impaired orientation to time, but had well-preserved orientation to place and person. The neurological examination revealed left homonymous hemianopsia, but no obvious motor or sensory deficits. She appeared agitated, and was talkative with an elated, euphoric mood. She also had a reduced need for sleep and pressured speech. She tended to touch the examiner while speaking. She showed no deficits in the line bisection and cancellation tasks, but was unable to copy an interlocked pentagon. She was also unable to draw a clock. Three days later, she developed motor weakness (grade 4) and hypesthesia in her left arm and face. Dysarthria developed along with persistence of her restlessness and manic features. The motor deficits and dysarthria were improved the next day, but the sensory deficit was unchanged.\nRoutine serologic testing and electrocardiography were all normal. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) was performed on admission, which revealed an acute infarction in the right parietal lobe with subtle involvement of the posterior temporal area (). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed an obstruction of portion M1 of the right middle cerebral artery (). Repeat MRI on the fourth hospital day after the motor deficits developed revealed that the infarction had increased in size (). Brain 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) performed 13 days after admission showed reduced FDG uptake in the right hemisphere, which was most severe in the right parietal lobe and left cerebellum ().\nWhen she was discharged 2 weeks after admission, her neurological deficits had improved. Her restlessness and manic symptoms had also partially alleviated without treatment. After 13 months, her neurological deficits and manic symptoms had resolved completely, except for the left-sided visual field defect. Repeated brain 18F-FDG PET showed that the previous reduction in FDG uptake in the right hemisphere had improved (). What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "An 85-year-old man with a medical history significant for ASH, hypertension,\nhyperlipidaemia, and severe aortic stenosis presented to our centre for worsening dyspnoea\nwith the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III symptoms with no reported angina nor\nsyncope. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 76\nb.p.m. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for an aortic systolic murmur best heard at the\nsecond intercostal space with a significant decrease in S2. The transthoracic echocardiogram\n(TTE) showed ASH with a diastolic septal diameter of 17 mm, a fixed LVOT gradient of\n11 mmHg, moderately calcified aortic valve associated with severe stenosis (mean gradient of\n42 mmHg, the maximal velocity of 4.05 m/s, the continuity equation was not applicable to\ncalculate aortic valve area due to accelerated jet in the LVOT), an ejection fraction (EF)\nof 60%, and normal systolic pulmonary artery pressure. Cardiac catheterization revealed\nnormal coronary angiogram. He had a low risk for open-heart surgery (Logistic Euro score\n7.96%, STS score 2.9%) with a frail physical state for which the Heart team decided to refer\nhim for TAVI. Computed tomography and angiography showed ASH with a moderately calcified\naortic valve, mild LVOT calcifications (), and an accessible femoral route.\nThe TAVI procedure was performed with a 26 mm Sapien 3 bioprosthetic valve (Edwards\nLifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). The initial result was acceptable, with no PVL nor coronary\nobstruction. We noticed an upward movement of the valve during implantation (). There was no pre- nor post-dilations required. No\nelectrical or access site complications were encountered. The patient was transferred to the\ncardiac ward.\nLater that day, the patient developed chest discomfort associated with atrial fibrillation\nwith a rapid ventricular response at 130 b.p.m. and non-specific ST-T changes. A TTE showed\nnormal EF, a mean aortic gradient of 8 mmHg, a fistula jet reaching from the LVOT to the RA,\nno right ventricular dilation, no right atrial dilation, and no pericardial effusion.\nTransoesophageal echocardiogram showed mild PVL, and an LVOT pseudo-aneurysm, that is\nassociated with an LVOT to the RA fistula. The fistula's jet was lining the tricuspid valve\nplane with a maximal gradient of 123 mmHg (). A post-procedure computed\ntomography (CT) scan showed that the bioprosthesis was well placed with no significant PVL,\nno coronary artery obstruction. At the level of the LVOT, there exists a small\npseudo-aneurysm of 5 mm, immediately upstream of the valve prosthesis. It is extended by a\nfistulous track towards the RA of an \u223c2 mm diameter, where the jet flushes parallel to and\noutlining the tricuspid valve plane ().\nThe patient remained asymptomatic during the course of the hospitalization and was\ndischarged home on Day 7 post-TAVI. The follow-up TTE was done 1 month later showed a\npersistence of the fistula with an increase in size (from 2 to 2.95 mm) and an increased\ncolour jet and gradient (maximal gradient 166 mmHg) ( and ).

    "question": "A 77-year-old female patient with a five-month history of stroke, right-sided weakness and left knee contracture presented to our Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department. Following the onset of stroke, the patient was initially treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) before being transferred to the neurology ward. Following discharge from the ward, a monoarthritis of the left knee developed. According to the patient\u2019s relatives, the patient\u2019s knee was evaluated by an orthopedics and traumatology team; however, no details of the evaluation/investigations/ treatment applied are known. To date, the patient had not partaken in a home exercise program or received physical therapy. The patient\u2019s past medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and a right total knee replacement five years previously due to osteoarthritis. Prior to development of the stroke, the patient was independent of activities of daily living.\nPhysical examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Score of 12 with motor and sensory aphasia. There was a flaccid paralysis of the right side. No spasticity was detected. The patient was incontinent of urine and feces. Examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed bilateral painful and limited ROM of the hips and left knee contracture. There was no effusion of the joints. The patient\u2019s Functional Independence Measure[] score was 23.\nThe patient\u2019s initial routine blood tests were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 69 mm/hour and the C-reactive protein was 11.4 mg/L. An anteroposterior X-ray of the\npelvis revealed extensive bilateral periarticular HO (Figure 1). A two-way bilateral X-ray of the knees revealed a total knee replacement on the right side and extensive osteoarthritis of the left knee (Figure 2). Pharmacological treatment with indomethacin was commenced. The Orthopedics and Traumatology Department was consulted for further management of the bilateral hip HO and left knee contracture. Initially, arthroscopic debridement of the left knee was recommended; however, the patient\u2019s relatives did not consent to the procedure. Due to the patient\u2019s limited cooperation, immobility, poor right-sided motor recovery, bilateral limited hip movement and left knee contracture, it was decided that she would gain little benefit from an active inpatient rehabilitation program. The patient was discharged with appropriate analgesia and a home exercise plan with a view to follow-up in the outpatient clinic in a month\u2019s time. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 77-year-old Dutch Caucasian woman presented with a 2-day history of slight headache and progressive walking problems. No recent head trauma had occurred. Past medical history was extended including diabetes, ischemic stroke, hypertension and heart failure. She had been using among others an oral anticoagulant agent because of atrial fibrillation and mitral valve replacement. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for a disturbed heel to shin coordination test and an inability to walk without support. Results of laboratory studies revealed no significant abnormalities and an International Normalized Ratio of 2.6. Computed tomography of the brain showed a 5 mm thick linear hyperdense lesion extending along the right side of the interhemispheric fissure (). Because of the stable neurological condition the patient was admitted for observation and treated conservatively. The anticoagulant agent was stopped and gradual improvement was noticed in a few days. Five days after admission she was able to walk without assistance and she was discharged from the hospital. Two weeks later the patient was in excellent condition.

    "question": "We report on a case of a 73-year-old man who presented to our emergency department due to progressive shortness of breath (). He was an ex-smoker (30 pack-years of cigarette smoking), with a medical history of dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, PAD, and left main coronary artery disease (CAD), which led to CABG surgery four months previously. His medical therapy included warfarin, antihypertensive drugs, statin, and a proton-pump inhibitor. Since surgery, he felt a gradual reduction in functional capacity with significant worsening of dyspnea in the last three days. On physical examination, the patient was mildly dyspnoic at rest and had low blood pressure (BP) readings of 105/74 mm Hg on the right arm and 97/69 mm Hg on the left arm. Heart sounds were quiet and irregular. Lung sound was clear bilaterally, with the exception of fine crackles in the right base. Jugular venous pressure was mildly elevated, and there was no evidence of peripheral edema. The rest of physical examination was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 90 beats per minute (bpm), incomplete left bundle branch block, and diffuse T wave inversion in precordial leads. Laboratory tests demonstrated markedly elevated NT-proBNP levels of 3564 ng/L (reference levels <0.73 mg/L), mild increase in serial high sensitive troponin essays (hsTnT) of 31 ng/L and 51 ng/L (reference levels <14 ng/L), and normocytic anemia of 115 g/L (reference levels 138-175 g/L). The chest x-ray displayed an enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild pleural effusion and cranial redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, suggesting heart failure. Given the patient`s symptoms, CT pulmonary angiography was also requested to rule out pulmonary embolism. The test did not show signs of pulmonary embolus but showed a large circulatory pericardial effusion (). The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit. The bedside echo showed global hypocontractility of the left ventricle (ejection fraction of 40%) with a confirmed large circulatory pericardial effusion and increased respiratory variations in mitral and tricuspid inflow. Pericardiocentesis was performed with the drainage of 1500 mL of sanguineous effusion over a couple of days. The control laboratory tests showed an hsTnT increase (1865 ng/L) without the progression of clinical symptoms and without echographic or ECG changes. Coronary angiography showed significant stenosis of the left subclavian artery just proximal to the functional LIMA graft to the left anterior descending artery, which indicated the presence of CSSS. While the sudden hsTnT increase could have been explained by pericardiocentesis and consequential hemodynamic changes, myocardial strain, or mild myocardial trauma, it is likely that CSSS had significantly aggravated myocardial perfusion in specific hemodynamic circumstances following pericardiocentesis. Although subclavian bruit was absent, DUS of upper extremities showed reduced blood flow in the left arm, while CTA confirmed the previous angiographic finding and the anomalous origin of the left vertebral artery from the aorta (). As a result, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed. A stent was implanted in the stenotic subclavian artery, followed by optimal blood flow across the treated vessel (). The procedure's success was later also confirmed with control DUS. Control echocardiographic study revealed the absence of pericardial effusion and improvement in cardiac systolic function, which correlated with the patient` s clinical recovery. The patient was discharged from the hospital in a stable condition. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "We report the case of a 32-year-old Chinese patient who had a history of two pregnancy-related thromboembolic events. These events were cerebral vein-venous sinus thrombosis at 5 gestational weeks (GW) when she was 27 years old and left lower thrombosis following a miscarriage in her second pregnancy in the first trimester at 29 years old. At that point, she was then treated with warfarin.\nAfter routine assessments were performed in the patient at 32 years old, no inherited or acquired risk factors for thrombosis or related family history were discovered, except for AT activity. Her AT activity was only 37% (normal range: 75%\u2013125%) (Berichrom Antithrombin III; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) while the AT antigen (BN ProSpec system AT-III; Siemens) was 93% (normal range: 80%\u2013120%). The D-dimer concentration was 0.2 \u00b5g/mL D-dimer units (normal range: 0\u20130.5 \u00b5g/mL D-dimer units), platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid was 82% (normal range: 60%\u201380%), the prothrombin time was 13.5 s (normal range: 10.3\u201316.6 s), and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 32 s (normal range: 25.1\u201336.5 s). Her fibrinogen concentration was 1.13 \u00b5g/mL (normal range: 0\u20135 \u00b5g/mL), protein C activity was 98.8% (normal range: 70%\u2013140%), protein S activity was 93.8% (normal range: 63.5%\u2013149%), and homocysteine concentration was 9.8 \u00b5mol/L (normal range: 3\u201317 \u00b5mol/L). Antiphospholipid antibodies, including lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and beta-2 glycoprotein I-dependent anticardiolipin antibodies, were negative.\nThe SERPINC1 gene in this patient was then analyzed by the gold standard Sanger fluorescent sequencing method in which all exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter region were examined (ABI PRISM 3130; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Molecular analysis showed a heterozygous mutation, which led to a tyrosine to cysteine change at amino acid position 95, compatible with a type II HBS defect (). On the basis of the findings of a low AT activity level, normal AT antigen level, and genetic result, we made the diagnosis of type II hereditary AT deficiency. Unfortunately, her parents were not available for laboratory assessment for AT activity and genetic testing.\nWhen the patient was 31 years old, she consulted her doctor because she wanted to become pregnant again. At the start of her pregnancy, thromboprophylaxis with self-injection of LMWH at 4100 units every 12 hours with FFP 1 unit weekly was prescribed to replace warfarin because of its adverse effects on the fetus. She had arachidonic acid and D-dimer concentrations measured fortnightly, while her AT activity and anti-Xa measurements were checked monthly throughout pregnancy (). Her serum AT activity level remained at 30% to 40%, but no thrombosis occurred during pregnancy. Her plasma D-dimer concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 \u00b5g/mL D-dimer units, which were within the expected range for pregnant women. Nevertheless, peak anti-Xa activity levels ranged from 0 to 0.29 IU/mL in the second trimester. This activity was not consistent with the required dose ranging from 0.5 to 1 U/mL 2 to 4 hours following the injection. This finding indicated the phenomenon of HR.\nAfter 14 GW, she used LMWH as a bridge to warfarin, then she continued warfarin therapy before delivery. The international normalized ratio was monitored weekly to achieve a level between 2.0 and 3.0. She resumed LMWH and FFP from 37 GW. A cesarean section was scheduled at 37+4 GW. The patient delivered a healthy, 3165-g girl with Apgar scores of 10 at both 1 and 5 minutes. There were no adverse effects of the anticoagulation therapies. The patient and her newborn were discharged without morbidity 7 days later. She continued the same doses of LMWH with FFP, which was replaced with oral anticoagulant therapy from 6 weeks after delivery. The patient and her infant were healthy with no sequelae or adverse events at a follow-up visit 6 weeks after delivery.\nThe reporting of this study conforms to the CARE guidelines.

The patient complained of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 24 hours. The patient mentioned an inability to tolerate solid food for approximately one year. The physical examination showed no acute distress, no respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and the abdomen was obese and non-tender, without rebound or guarding. An NG tube was placed. His vital signs revealed a temperature of 36.5 \u00b0C, blood pressure 143/119 mmHg , pulse 163 beats/minute, respiratory rate 19 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. Laboratory evaluation showed WBC count of 26 k/\u03bcL with 90% neutrophils, albumin 1.4 mmol/L, BNP 2,300 pg/mL, international normalized ratio 1.4, BUN 22 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.1 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast showed severe distention of the stomach and duodenum with extensive gas in the wall of the dependent portion of the stomach and extension of gas into the adjacent gastric veins, portal vein, and portal vein branches within the liver [Figure ].\nThe branches of the celiac artery and SMA were patent. The patient was resuscitated with crystalloids, given broad-spectrum antibiotics, NG tube for gastric decompression, diltiazem infusion for atrial fibrillation, and admitted to the ICU. The patient declined any surgical intervention.\nOn the second day in the hospital, the patient showed improvement with his abdominal pain, now a 4/10 down from 10/10 on admission. The patient remained on a diltiazem drip for his atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. His abdomen was soft and non-tender; however, his NG tube output was approximately 1 L of bilious fluid. On the third day, the NG tube output was 900 mL of bilious fluid overnight and he had no bowel movement since admission. The WBC reduced to 12,000/\u03bcL and he had a benign abdominal examination. CT scan was done with enteral and intravenous contrast to assess for bowel obstruction. It showed that the stomach was now decompressed and there was decreased air within the wall of the stomach and the previously seen air within the left gastric vein and the gastroepiploic veins had resolved [Figure ].\nThe small intestines, appendix, and colon appeared normal.

    "question": "An 82-year-old female with secondary post-herpetic uveitic glaucoma of the right eye presented at the Department of Ophthalmology for an elective trans-scleral laser cyclophotocoagulation. She had a history of chronic heart failure, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in remission. Her regular medications included acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate, telmisartan, atorvastatin and escitaloprame. The patient denied having any allergies. On preoperative assessment she weighed 62 kg, her height was 162 cm and her blood pressure (BP) was 166/83 mmHg with 70/min heart rate (HR). Physical examination was unremarkable.\nThe patient\u2019s orbit was anatomically normal. She was given a retrobulbar block to the right eye with 2 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 2 mL of 2% lidocaine. No mydriatic agent was used. She did not move her eye during the procedure. Aspiration for blood was negative. Upon injection, no resistance was felt. 2-3 minutes after the injection, she started yawning and feeling progressively drowsy; anaesthesiology team was immediately called. 5-8 minutes after the injection she became unresponsive to verbal and tactile stimuli; her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 3. On arrival of the team she had developed bradycardia with hypotension, her HR was 40/min, BP 50/30 mmHg and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) 85%. 10 mg of ephedrine was promptly administered intravenously (i.v.) with no significant effect, continued by 3 i.v. doses of 0.1 mg adrenaline 2 minutes later. Concurrently the patient developed respiratory arrest, her SpO2 had fallen to 54%, BP was 163/100 mmHg with HR 93/min. A bolus of 200 mL intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) was given. Anaesthesia was induced with 50 mg of propofol, the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated, and her vitals had stabilized (SpO2 98%, BP 113/60 mmHg, HR 92/min). She was additionally sedated with 5 mg of midazolam. Because of persistent hypotension (RR 92/58), 500 mL of hydroxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.4) in isotonic sodium chloride solution was also administered.\nSurgery was cancelled and the patient was relocated to the ICU. She was additionally sedated with midazolam and propofol, then gradually shifted through supportive ventilation techniques to spontaneous ventilation and extubated 6 hours after admission. There was no need for vasoactive support, oxygen or fluid replacement therapy. Blood test results were within normal range. Her BP was 140/60 mmHg, HR 71/min, SpO2 95%, without additional oxygen.

    "question": "This case report presents an 80-year-old female with past medical history of Marfan syndrome with extensive cardiovascular manifestations including coarctation of the aorta, mechanical aortic valve and mitral valve replacement, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (25\u201330%), and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted to the emergency general surgical service for complaints of acute onset colicky periumbilical abdominal pain, progressive abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting for 2 days. Emesis was described as non-bloody and non-bilious. Other pertinent history included one bowel movement 12 h prior to admission, which was non-bloody and inability to pass flatus for more than 24 h. No previous episode of abdominal pain of similar nature were elicitated. Physical examination was significant for mild abdominal distension and generalized tenderness to palpation in all quadrants without signs of peritonitis. Patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Significant laboratory findings were INR of 2.20 (on warfarin for valve replacement), hyponatremia of 125, acute kidney injury with creatinine of 1.56. computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis was significant for high-grade small bowel obstruction with a swirling of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) suggesting rotation of intestinal mesentery (Fig. ) []. The SMV was located to the right of SMA, a reliable finding against intestinal malrotation [] (Fig. ). Further, there was no radiologic evidence of malrotation like transposition of SMA and SMV, the horizontal part of the duodenum not reaching medioventral line, and malposition of ileocecal junction []. The INR was not reversed with FFP and Vitamin K due to concern for stroke. Emergent exploratory laparotomy within 6 h of admission was performed which was significant for midgut volvulus with the small bowel rotating around the base of mesentery a complete 360\u00b0. There were no signs of ischemia, and hence manual untwisting of the bowel was performed [, ]. The cecum was noted to be on the right lower quadrant and ligament of Treitz was on the left upper quadrant. The small bowel mesentery was noted to appear long with narrow base and floppy likely contributing to hypermobility of the small bowel. The patients postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged to skilled nursing facility for further rehabilitation. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 70-year-old right-handed female was brought to the emergency room 35 min after the sudden onset of a stroke. She arrived at the hospital at 11.35 a.m. with dysarthria, right homonymous hemianopsia, dense right hemiplegia, and partial gaze palsy.\nNeurological deficit on presentation was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) with a score of 24. She had a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.\nOn general medical evaluation she was alert but disorientated. Her blood pressure was 170/80, serum glucose value 89 mg/dl, and cholesterol 213 mg/dl.\nAt 12:00 she underwent an emergent brain CT scan, which revealed no hemorrhage and only a mild front left hypodensity in the insular area. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score was 8. CT angiogram showed an occlusion of the left M1 trunk, and CT perfusion (CTP) revealed a mismatch among the CBF (cerebral blood flow), MTT (mean transit time), and CBV (cerebral blood volume) maps (Figure ).\nAll stroke patients arriving at our hospital undergo an emergent brain CT scan, CT angiogram (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP), according to a protocol agreed upon by neurologists and intensivists.\nOn the basis of the presence of penumbra, the decision was taken to transfer the patient to an angiographic ward.\nBecause the angiographic suite was busy with other procedures, an angiography was performed 6 h after the onset of symptoms without any change in her clinical condition. It confirmed an occlusion of the main M1 trunk with excellent collateral circulation from the leptomeningeal anterior cerebral artery and retrograde opacification of the distal M1 segment.\nAn angiogram was obtained by pulling back the microcatheter to show the extent of the thrombus.\nAccording to exclusion criteria of the SITS-MOST Study Protocol [], Rendu Osler syndrome represents an absolute contraindication for rt PA infusion.\nWe opted for a mechanical thrombectomy performed more than 6 h after the onset of the stroke with a Hyperform 4 mm \u00d7 7 mm balloon angioplasty (EV3) positioned inside the thrombus. Recanalization was achieved with rapid inflations (duration of the inflation, maximum 10 s) at different levels of the M1 trunk.\nAt the end of the procedure, the artery was recanalized. Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Perfusion Categories (TICI) was grade 3 (Figure ).\nFollow-up CTP after 24 h and 7 days revealed persistence of the mismatch (Figure ).\nNIHSS score at 24 h was 8, and the Rankin scale at 3 months documented a slight disability (Modified Rankin Score 2).

He first noticed it 1 year before and it had progressively increased in size to 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm. The mass was soft, non-tender, and freely mobile in the subcutaneous tissue with normal-appearing overlying skin. Examination revealed bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy (right of 1 cm and a ganglionic conglomerates of 4.5 \u00d7 7 cm in left inguinal region). Mohs surgery was performed, and a tumor and ganglion biopsy was taken, histopathological examination revealed high-grade malignancy of primary cutaneous appendages of skin with basaloid differentiation of squamous cells, glandular and alveolar tubule, in some areas myxoid degeneration, microcalcifications, lymphatic and vascular permeation; the tumor was less than 1 mm from the edges of the section and from the surgical bed and ganglion right inguinal lymphatic with metastasis of malignant neoplasm mixed with high skin grade (Fig. and ).\nAn abdominal computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast was performed in which a solid tumor lesion in intergluteal cleft of 2.3 cm, as well as a giant adenopathy in left inguinal region (4.5 cm conglomerate) was reported.

    "question": "The case we present here is about a 69-year-old male patient who presented to our hospital with substernal chest pain associated with shortness of breath of 10 days duration and one episode of loss of consciousness one day back. The patient denied chest trauma, fever, or chills. He was a past smoker and taking medicines for systemic hypertension, type-2 diabetes mellitus, and long-standing atrial fibrillation. He was on aspirin, atorvastatin, atenolol, amlodipine, and metformin. In the emergency room, his systolic blood pressure was found to be of 170/90 mmHg with heart rate of 45 beats/min. Family history was unremarkable for any cardiovascular illness. Patient was conscious with no focal neurological deficit. Physical examination was within normal limits except for a soft systolic murmur at the apex. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry were within normal limits. Electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response and ST segment depression of 3 mm in leads V2 and V6 with T-wave inversion. Laboratory studies did not show any elevation in cardiac enzymes. A computed tomography scan of the head showed normal findings. He was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for the placement of a temporary pacemaker and coronary angiography (CAG).\nTemporary pacemaker was inserted via right femoral vein and kept in the right ventricle. CAG was performed via right femoral artery approach. Selective cannulation of the left coronary artery revealed a normal left main coronary artery bifurcating into the left anterior descending (LAD) and the left circumflex artery (LCX). There were non-obstructive lesions in the mid-LAD as well as at the first diagonal branch. LCX had minor atherosclerotic plaques. RCA was hooked with Judkins right catheter 3.5 \u00d7 6 French (Cordis). Selective cannulation of the RCA revealed a dissection within the proximal segment of an uplifted tortuous (Shepherd\u2019s Crook morphology) RCA with the normal flow down the distal vessel ( and ).\nThe dissection was treated by direct stenting (3.5 mm \u00d7 24 mm, Partner Sirolimus Eluting Stent, Lepu Medical), after which the dissection disappeared (). Three days later, his heart rate was in a range of 60-70 beats/min and temporary pacemaker was removed.

    "question": "We report the case of a 58-year-old male that presented to our Emergency Department with complaints of acute interscapular back pain and bilateral lower extremities weakness.\nPatient's medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. His surgical history consisted of umbilical hernia repair and left hip arthroplasty. Patient had no allergies and had stopped smoking many years ago. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 30 days prior to admission, for which he was started on rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. The rest of his medications included atorvastatin, fish oil, sitagliptin, quinapril, and triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide.\nOn the day of admission, the patient admitted waking up at 3:00 am with sudden onset, sharp, interscapular back pain. He denied any similar pain in the past. The patient first presented to another institution, where he started having bilateral lower extremities numbness, which progressed rapidly to bilateral weakness. At this point, he was still able to walk but with difficulty. He was then transferred to our institution, where his weakness became more pronounced. Patient denied any other neurologic symptoms. There was no history of trauma. Prior to this, he had a left hip arthroplasty three weeks earlier, which was performed under spinal (lumbar) anesthesia, without complications. Rivaroxaban was stopped three days before the surgery. Postoperatively he did not receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was restarted on the OAC few days later. Moreover, he reported driving for almost 7 hours from Elmira (New York) to Staten Island (New York) one day prior to presentation.\nInitial physical examination revealed an alert and oriented patient in no acute distress, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. His blood pressure was 148/98 mmHg; heart rate was 82 beats/min and irregular; body temperature was 98.7\u00b0F; respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams were within normal limits. Tenderness was elicited over the upper thoracic spine. There were no neurological deficits in the cranial nerves or upper limbs. The motor strength in both lower limbs was of Medical Research Council grade 0/5. A sensory level was evident at the level of T2 with positive bilateral Babinski reflexes.\nInitial laboratory assays included a hemoglobin concentration of 11 g/dL, a platelet count of 176 \u00d7 109/L, an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 36.6 seconds, a prothrombin time (PT) of 18.4 seconds, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.6. Kidney function and liver enzymes were normal. Electrocardiogram and chest radiograph were unremarkable. A noncontrast computerized tomography (CT) of the brain was negative for bleed, and a CT of the chest was also negative for dissection.\nThe clinical presentation combined with findings on the neurological exam pointed towards a spinal pathology. Moreover, a spinal bleed was strongly suspected given the history of recent spinal anesthesia in addition to the rivaroxaban use. An emergent cervical and thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an acute 6.3 \u00d7 0.6 \u00d7 1.6 cm intradural hematoma from C7 to T2, with spinal cord edema (). Neurosurgical intervention was not deemed an option at this point given that the increased risk of rivaroxaban-induced bleeding outweighed the benefits. Therefore, a conservative management was adopted, including close neurological monitoring in the intensive care unit along with high dose intravenous dexamethasone (100 mg once followed by 10 mg every 6 hrs). Patient was also offered prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), but he declined to proceed with this therapeutic option given its potential side effects, such as prothrombotic state, as well as its uncertain efficacy in similar spinal bleed. He was started instead on aminocaproic acid.\nThe following day, patient's neurological exam had improved. Sensory level was down to T4-T5, and motor strength was 4/5 in the right lower extremity while it remained 1/5 on the left lower extremity. Given the increased risk of bleeding, especially taking into account the minor improvement in the patient's condition, surgical intervention was delayed for three days, to allow complete elimination of rivaroxaban. On hospital day 4, patient underwent a successful and uneventful anterior C7 corpectomy with resection of a large intradural hematoma. Postoperatively, his neurological exam continued to improve slowly, and he was discharged for intensive rehabilitation 5 days after the surgery. A repeat MRI done 6 weeks later showed almost complete resolution of the spinal hemorrhage (). What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 71-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history significant for type-2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic pericardial effusion and hypothyroidism presented with 5 weeks of increasing fatigue and 1 day of dizziness.\nPhysical examination revealed that the patient was afebrile, had a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, an irregularly irregular heart rate of 102 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. There was no pulsus parodoxus. Examination of the head and neck showed pale conjunctiva, no palpable lymphadenopathy, jugular venous distension or bruits. Auscultation of the chest revealed scattered rhonchi. The patient was mildly tachycardic with no S3 or S4 heart sounds, murmurs or rubs appreciated. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, clubbing, cyanosis or edema and stools were guaiac negative.\nAn electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response with low voltage QRS complexes; electrical alternans were not present. The chest radiograph showed a very minimal pleural effusion with no cardiomegaly, infiltrates or masses.\nLaboratory analysis revealed a white blood-cell count of 12,900/L, with a normal differential, and a hemoglobin and hematocrit of 7.2 g/dl and 23.4%, respectively. The platelet count was 387 thousand/L. The red cell indices were microcytic and iron studies revealed an iron deficiency anemia. Liver function tests were normal. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 167 U/L (within normal limits). The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 16.49 mcIU/ml and the free T3 was 57 mcg/ml.\nThe patient was admitted for anemia and worked up for a gastrointestinal bleed. Three units packed red blood cells were transfused. Upper endoscopy revealed a mass just below the gastroesophageal junction and three nonbleeding gastric ulcers. To further evaluate the gastric mass, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed demonstrating a 30 \u00d7 17 mm polypoid mass visualized in the gastric cardia limited to the mucosa/submucosa. The biopsy revealed gastric adenocarcinoma, staged as T1N0M0 by EUS, and was Helicobacter pylori-negative.\nA two-dimensional echocardiogram was preformed to evaluate an 8-month old pericardial effusion. It demonstrated a 2.0 \u00d7 2.7 cm mass associated with the right atrium (RA). To better define the mass and its anatomic relationship within the RA, several imaging procedures were performed: 1) transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing a 5.7 cm2 shaped echodensity within the wall of the RA and a second, 16 cm2 echodensity, that extended across the atrioventricular groove (Figure ); 2) a contrast computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis negative for metastasis, but significant for a large pericardial effusion without pericardial thickening and a 2.6 \u00d7 2.1 cm filling defect in the right atrial appendage (Figure ); and 3) a cardiac MRI demonstrating a homogenous enhancing mass along the lateral wall of the right atrium. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated a hypermetabolic region in the heart corresponding to the mass observed on CT.\nAt this point, our differential diagnosis included a primary gastric adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the heart as well as two separate primary neoplastic processes (one involving the heart and one involving the stomach).\nTo determine the etiology of the cardiac mass, a biopsy was accomplished via a pericardial window through an anterolateral thoracotomy. At thoracotomy, the parietal pericardium appeared normal. Visual inspection revealed several nodular areas over the body of the right atrium, superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC). There was no evidence of a thickened, constrictive layer surrounding the heart. Two hundred milliliters of straw-colored fluid was recovered from the pericardial cavity. The fluid was negative for malignant cells and consisted of a few benign and reactive mesothelial cells mixed with inflammatory cells and proteinaceous debris. Viral, bacterial and mycobacterial cultures of the pericardial fluid were negative. Biopsy revealed a normal parietal pericardium and myocardium. However, the visceral pericardium showed a lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate diagnostic of epicarditis (Figure ). After thoracotomy, the patient had a partial gastrectomy to remove the adenocarcinoma. The postoperative course was complicated by infection, requiring a 3-month stay in the intensive care unit. During this time, there was no evidence suggestive of constrictive physiology. Since the patient continued to remain asymptomatic from the epicarditis, no further imaging studies or procedures were performed to follow the \"mass.\" The patient eventually succumbed to infection.

    "question": "A 68-year-old woman visited our emergency department (ED) because of a sudden attack of severe back pain. The pain developed so suddenly that the ED physician provided a tentative diagnosis of aortic dissection. Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement revealed no findings related to the pain and both aortic dissection and any aortic involvement were excluded. The ED physician prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The next day, the patient presented to the outpatient department and was admitted for further examination. She had medical histories of asthma and atrial fibrillation, was not receiving any medication, was a current smoker, and was not an alcohol consumer. She owned a corgi dog that lived in her house and she had been bitten and scratched by the dog daily.\nUpon admission, her body temperature was 37.5 \u00b0C, with blood pressure 127/48 mmHg, heart rate 84 beats per minute and oxygen saturation 95% in ambient air with no accelerated respiration. She looked very ill suffering from the severe back pain. A physical examination did not note spinal knocking pain, neurological abnormality, or any other specific findings. A laboratory test revealed a white blood cell count of 13,360 cells/mm3 (normal value: 3900\u20139800 cells/mm3), platelet count of 17.0 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL, serum creatinine level of 0.66 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein level of 18.5 mg/dL (normal value: 0\u20130.5 mg/dL). Re-performed enhanced CT and plane magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was not diagnostic.\nOn the second hospital day, Gram-negative bacilli were detected in her blood cultures. We started intravenous meropenem 1 g every 8 h, based on a provisional diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess or vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis. P. multocida was identified, and drug susceptibility was confirmed by the Vitek2 system with GN and AST-N228 card, bioM\u00e9rieux (Table ) []. Then, the antimicrobial treatment was switched to intravenous ampicillin 2 g every 6 h.\nOn the eighth hospital day, MRI was re-performed with gadolinium-contrast to confirm the diagnosis. T2-weighted imaging and T1-weighted imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed an epidural abscess at the Th5\u20136 level (Fig. ). We decided to withhold a surgery and continued the conservative treatment because of absence of a neurological deficit. On the twenty-fourth hospital day, the abscess had disappeared on the plane MRI. The antimicrobial treatment was switched to oral levofloxacin 500 mg every 24 h before hospital discharge. In total, 12-week antibiotic treatment was completed. She visits our hospital with another medical condition which is unrelated to this episode, and no recurrence occurred in 5 years after the treatment was completed.

    "question": "This is the case of a 73-year-old woman affected by hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis. The HBV infection was diagnosed in 1981, when she underwent gastrectomy for complicated gastric ulcer. In February 1998, she underwent treatment with 3 million units of Interferon alpha 3 times per week per 24 weeks, without obtaining a biochemical and virological response. She was admitted to our Liver Unit in 1999. She appeared to be in satisfactory general clinical condition and reported being affected by osteoporosis (for which she was treated with calcium and cholecalciferol). She had no history of heart, lung, kidney, metabolic, or thyroid diseases. A needle liver biopsy was performed and histological cirrhosis was diagnosed. At that time the HBV-DNA quantification showed 330,000 copies/ml (COBAS AmpliPrep System, Roche Diagnostics, Monza, Italy) and therapy with 100 mg/die of lamivudine was therefore started. The treatment was promptly and persistently efficacious. Subsequently, the patient regularly attended the outpatient clinic of our liver unit. In February 2010, as a consequence of a slight increase of HBV-DNA levels (up to 300 IU/ml), tenofovir dipivoxil 245 mg/die therapy was introduced, replacing lamivudine.\nOn November 3, 2011 the alpha-fetoprotein level rose to 217.5 ng/ml and an HCC nodule measuring 14 mm in diameter located in the right lobe was diagnosed by contrast iodine-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Iodopride at a concentration of 370 mg/ml was the contrast medium used and it was administered intravenously at a dosage of 1.2 ml per kilogram of body weight. In December 2011, the patient underwent percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of the lesion and was subsequently followed up with periodic CECT examinations, according to AASLD practice guidelines; a total of 3 CECTs were performed without the occurrence of any side effect. In occasion of the CECT control on February 5, 2013, the patient appeared to be in good general clinical condition, the blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, the electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal, the heart rate was 68 beats per minutes (bpm), the blood tests were normal, HBV-DNA was undetectable. However, 4 hours after the CECT scan with iodine contrast medium administration the patient complained of palpitations, dizziness, and epigastric pain. The blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, radial pulse was frequent and irregular, and ECG revealed the presence of high frequency AF (120 bpm). The cardiac enzymes, evaluated every 6 hours from the onset of AF for 24 hours, were persistently within normal ranges. She was treated intravenously with amiodarone 5 mg/kg for the first hour and subsequently at the dosage of 50 mg/hour for maintenance and with subcutaneous 6000 IU/die of enoxaparin. Twenty-four hours after onset of symptoms, there was a reversion to sinus rhythm and on February 6 the patient was discharged from the hospital (Figures and ). During hospitalization, an echocardiographic examination was performed which showed the presence of mitral annulus calcification with mitral insufficiency of moderate degree and mild enlargement of the left atrium.\nFour months later the patient was scheduled for a further CECT scan control. At admission on June 10, she exhibited laboratory tests\u2014including thyroid hormone values\u2014within normal limits, she had no symptoms, her liver disease was compensated, the blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg, the ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with heart rate of 68 bpm. One hour after the intravenous iodide contrast medium administration, she complained about an intense chest pain without any irradiation. The blood pressure was 100/70 mm Hg, her heart rate was irregular with 150 bpm and ECG analysis identified AF. The cardiac enzyme levels were within normal ranges. Therapy with aiodarone was promptly started but this time it had no clinical effect. Therefore the patient underwent electrical cardioversion, which succeeded in reverting to sinus rhythm (Figures and ). During hospitalization a neck ultrasonography examination was performed that showed an increased volume of the thyroid, many small hypo-echoic nodules (diameter <0.5 cm) and swollen cervical lymph nodes. Thyroid tests revealed a profile of subclinical hyperthyroidism [TSH 0.146 \u03bcIU/ml (normal range 0.3\u20134.2); FT3 0.9 ng/ml (normal range 0.87\u20131.78); FT4 9.12 \u03bcg/dl (normal range 6.09\u201312.23)]. On June 13, 2013 treatment with flecainide 100 mg/die was started; the patient showed no signs of AF and she was discharged from the hospital. Thereafter the patient underwent surveillance of HCC by both ultrasound and magnetic resonance examinations without showing recurrence of hepatic neoplasm so far. She did not experience any new episodes of AF (indeed, she is under flecanide treatment until today), hormone thyroid values remained within normal ranges and no further treatment for thyroid dysfunction was necessary.

    "question": "A 58-year-old right-handed woman with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, IHD, and chronic kidney disease, on maintenance dialysis presented to the ICU from the dialysis unit when the doctors found her developing sudden onset of right-sided weakness after the completion of the dialysis. She was immediately assessed by a neurologist in the ICU, where she was found to have right-sided hemiplegia with right upper motor neuron facial palsy with dysarthria. Her pulse and blood pressure were stable. She was shifted for the CT brain scan immediately which revealed a hyperdense left middle cerebral artery (MCA) with old bilateral basal ganglia lacunar infarcts. She was diagnosed to have acute left MCA stroke with unknown mechanism and received IV tPA 80 minutes after the stroke.\nFollowing the infusion of IV tPA, the power of left arm and leg improved.Approximately two hours after the completion of tPA,she developed sudden onset of chest pain with cardiovascular collapse. Her blood pressure was 60 mm Hg systolic with pulse rate of 30/min. Immediately, she was started on inotropes. ECG revealed ST segment elevation in anterior leads. Intravenous atropine was started. A temporary pacemaker was inserted. Her troponin-T was sent which was elevated to 7.63. Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 15% with hypokinetic anterior and lateral wall. There was no cardiac thrombus.\nHer baseline ECG was reassessed which showed QS pattern in II, III, aVF indicating an old inferior wall myocardial infarction. Neurological examination revealed that she was unresponsive to verbal commands. Pupils were dilated bilaterally (3 mm) in size and reactive. She had a withdrawal response in her left arm and leg. The mechanism of myocardial injury was postulated to be thrombolytic mediated distal embolization of the proximal thrombus in the coronary arteries.

    "question": "We describe the case of an 18-year-old woman with chest pain radiating to the left arm at rest. Her past medical history was unremarkable, apart from Graves\u2019 disease on treatment with methimazole at a dosage of 5 mg/die. She came to our attention in 2020, when she was admitted to the emergency department (ED) for the onset of sharp chest pain radiated to the left arm and to the trapezius ridge. Pain was less severe when in a seated position and more severe when in a supine position, when breathing deeply or during coughing. No episodes of fever, diarrhoea, respiratory symptoms, or myalgia were reported in the previous days. In the ED, the pain was persistent; laboratory findings showed no significant abnormalities. In particular, cardiac markers, D-dimer, complete blood count, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were normal. The ECG () showed tachycardia at 128 b.p.m. and diffuse, concave (\u2018saddle-shaped\u2019) and non-specific ST-segment elevations in all leads except aVR and V1, and PR-segment depression except aVR. Analgesic drugs were administered and the patient was then hospitalized in the Cardiology Department for further diagnostic and therapeutic assessment. On physical examination, blood pressure was 141/63 mmHg and body temperature 36.5\u00b0C. On cardiac auscultation, S1 and S2 heart sounds were normal and no pathological murmur was reported; no friction rub was heard. Absence of jugular vein distension and no pulsus paradoxus was reported. Laboratory tests were repeated and showed no significant abnormalities: serum Beta 2 microglobulin, electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, and transaminases (ALT, AST) were normal and renal function was not impaired, thus ruling out uraemic pericarditis. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was suppressed (<0.0008 mIU/L, local lab normal reference range: 0.4\u20134 mIU/L) and serum-free thyroxine 4 was increased (61.24 pg/mL, reference range: 8\u201319 pg/mL); cardiac markers and acute-phase proteins were still negative. Antithyroid therapy was optimized, increasing methimazole dosage to 10 mg TID, and oral propanolol 10 mg TID was introduced. Laboratory tests for autoimmune diseases were performed and the antinuclear antibody panel, lupus anti-coagulant, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies were negative. Additionally, anti-mitochondrial (AMA, M2), anti-extractable nuclear antigens, anti-actin smooth muscle antibodies, and anti-Scl-70 (topoisomerase I) antibodies were negative, excluding systemic autoimmune and auto-inflammatory causes of pericardial diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma and vasculitis. Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (nasopharyngeal swab), Epstein\u2013Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, Enterovirus, Parvovirus B19, and Adenovirus were also negative, so that the main viral infectious causes of pericarditis were excluded. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (EF = 65%), absence of valvular diseases, no pericardial effusion, and normal right ventricular dimensions and function. Thoracic non-ECG-gated CT angiography was then performed () and acute aortic and pulmonary diseases were ruled out. The CT showed the presence of a pericardial effusion with slightly increased density (with radiological characteristic not consistent with blood nature) having a maximum thickness of 15 mm in the upper mediastinum. To characterize this effusion, gadolinium cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and the effusion turned out to be an extrapericardial mass of 73 \u00d7 51 mm () located in the upper mediastinum. A minimal pericardial effusion was found near the anterior mid-basal wall of the left ventricle where the mass had contact with the pericardium. The pericardium, however, showed no signs of infiltration by the mass and no late gadolinium enhancement was described. In view of this and in the absence of surrounding lymphadenopathies, the haematology specialist indicated biopsy of the mass, which was then performed through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Histological analysis showed true thymic hyperplasia and, from an anatomopathological point of view, prevalence of thymic cortex with various Hassall\u2019s bodies in the absence of lymphoid infiltration was described. After the improvement of the symptoms, the patient was discharged and ambulatory follow-up was planned. At the 1-month follow-up visit on 4 November 2020, the patient was asymptomatic, TSH levels were normal (3 mIU/L), anti-TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) were 10 IU/L (vs. 35.50 IU/L on admission; reference range <0.55 IU/L), and a 12-month cardiac MRI was planned.

    "question": "A 70-year-old Caucasian man with a previously diagnosed, IgG-kappa multiple myeloma presented with a 3-month history of worsening dyspnea, dysphagia, and weight loss. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was established one year prior to presentation with a serum kappa free light chain (K-FLC) level of 685 mg/dL and a lambda FLC level of 0.13 mg/dL (kappa/lambda (K/L) ratio of 5269). The patient had no lytic bone lesions or liver or heart involvement and had a normocellular bone marrow with 70% plasma cells. He was never noted to have macroglossia or albuminuria. His past medical history was otherwise notable for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease with Bence Jones proteinuria (K-FLC proteinuria of 691 mg/dL). Upon initial evaluation, the patient was hypoxic to 78% in room air. He appeared tachypneic, with an increased work of breathing and accessory muscle use. Auscultation revealed overall reduced breath sounds, bibasilar crackles, and an irregular cardiac rhythm with a holosystolic grade III/VI murmur loudest at the cardiac apex.\nThe patient's arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.31, a pCO2 of 60, and a pO2 of 60 mmHg. His labs otherwise revealed an bicarbonate of 33 mmol/L, a creatinine of 2.55 mg/dL (increased from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL), a hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 7.4 \u00d7 103 per \u03bcL. The patient also had a B-type natriuretic peptide level of 572 pg/mL and serial cardiac troponin I levels of 0.22, 0.22, and 0.21 ng/mL drawn 6 to 8 hours apart. His K-FLC level was 1379 mg/dL with L-FLC of 0.65 mg/dL (K/L-FLC ratio of 2121).\nA chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions. His echocardiogram was notable for elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 64 mmHg, biatrial dilatation with normal sized ventricles, and a preserved ejection fraction. A ventilation-perfusion scan was negative for acute or chronic pulmonary embolus.\nSubsequently, the patient was admitted to the cardiac stepdown unit for inotropic diuresis and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). After diuresis, a right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed PA pressure of 34/9/18 mmHg (systolic/diastolic/mean) and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10 mmHg.\nDespite effective diuresis, the patient went into a worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure with almost continuous dependence on NIPPV. His pulmonary function tests revealed restrictive physiology with FEV1 of 61%, FVC of 58%, and FEV/FVC of 104%. A subsequent nerve conduction study was suggestive of bilateral phrenic axonal neuropathy.\nWith his worsening dysphagia and respiratory muscle weakness, the course was further complicated by aspiration pneumonitis. A barium swallow esophagram showed narrowing of the gastroesophageal junction and tertiary contractions in the esophagus. An upper endoscopy was unrevealing and biopsy samples were negative for amyloidosis, confirmed by lack of Congo red staining (not shown). A fat pad biopsy was also negative for amyloid.\nDue to deteriorating cardiopulmonary and renal status, the patient was transferred to our cardiac intensive care unit. A repeat RHC was performed and a right ventricular biopsy was diagnostic of cardiac amyloidosis. The patient subsequently received 3 doses of bortezomib and dexamethasone but passed away soon after from the multiorgan system failure, approximately 5 weeks after admission.\nAutopsy revealed IgG-kappa amyloid deposits in the left and right ventricles (), the diaphragm (), and the gastroesophageal junction (). There was no demyelination, amyloid deposition, or other abnormalities of the phrenic nerves (), nor was there amyloid infiltration of the lung parenchyma. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

He had a previous history of atrial fibrillation and had taken warfarin, digoxin, and bisoprolol. A physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation of the right lower abdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory data showed slight leukocytosis (WBC 8700/mm3) with slightly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP 0.43 mg/dL).\nA computed tomography (CT) image revealed a dilated cecum surrounded by free air, while the appendix was intact (). The preoperative diagnosis was perforation of the cecum. We planned to perform an urgent laparoscopic surgery.\nDuring the laparoscopy, the cecum was found to be dilated and discoloured ().\nAbout 10 h after symptoms onset, we performed a laparoscopic-assisted ileocecal resection. After the resection of the damaged intestine, extracorporeal end to end anastomosis was performed. The specimen revealed localized ischemic change on the anti-mesenteric side of the cecum (). Microscopically, the transluminal ischemic change was confirmed.\nThe lesion was diagnosed as isolated cecal necrosis. On day three postoperative, the patient developed a small intestinal perforation caused by sticking on the drainage tube, and he underwent ileostomy. After that, the patient progressed uneventfully, and the patient underwent closure of the ileostomy on the 51st postoperative day. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 12-year-old girl presented to emergency department of Shahid Rajaei Hospital in Ghazvin, Iran, with headache, drowsiness, mild fever, nausea, vomiting, and lethargy form two day before admission. The patient had a history of head trauma in a driving accident six weeks before and had been hospitalized in Hamedan city, where she had undergone spiral brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast due to reduced consciousness. Brain CT scan reported right frontal contusion, right frontal bone fracture involving frontal sinus and filling of ethmoid sinuses. The patient had received treatment in that centre for one week and was discharged in good general condition. The patient did not report any history of seizures, otorrhoea, or rhinorrhoea during these six weeks.\nThe presenting vital signs of the patient were as follows: pulse rate: 88/minute, respiratory rate: 18/minute, blood pressure: 105/75 mmHg, axillary Temperature: 37.8\u00b0C, Glasgow coma scale (GCS): 13/15 (eye response = 3, motor response = 6, verbal response = 4). Pupils were symmetrical of 3 millimetres and reduced response to light was detected in the right pupil. The four limbs had equal force of 5/5. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were 2+ and symmetrical, and bilateral plantar reflex was symmetrical and downward. Other clinical examination findings were unremarkable.\nThe patient underwent brain CT scan again in our centre, which revealed hydropneumocephalus in the frontal parenchyma with midline shift and compression effect on the anterior horn of the lateral ventricles in the right frontal lobe (). Thus, the patient underwent treatment with phenytoin and 100% concentration oxygen. Moreover, given her mild fever and likelihood of brain abscess, a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Vancomycin) was administered until magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done. Neurosurgery emergency consultation was requested, and the patient was admitted to the Intensive care unit for further treatments. Considering the trend of recovery and at the neurosurgeon\u2019s discretion, the patient was a candidate for conservative non-surgical therapy. MRI with contrast on the third day of admission revealed no rim enhancement around the lesion, and confirmed the diagnosis of tension hydropneumocephalus (). Therefore, antibiotic was discontinued.

    "question": "A 28-year-old sporty (martial arts practitioner) woman, without relevant medical history, activated the national emergency system because of two episodes of pre-syncope at home. Shortly after arrival of the medical team, she collapsed, and the cardiac monitorization showed ventricular fibrillation (VF) from which she was promptly defibrillated, and return of spontaneous circulation ensued. The electrocardiogram (ECG) after defibrillation showed sinus tachycardia with voltage criteria for left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy.\nAt the emergency room, blood pressure was 105/72 mmHg and a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur was heard at the left sternal border on cardiac auscultation. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin showed a slight elevation (0.045 ng/mL).\nTransthoracic echocardiographic evaluation revealed LV enlargement (112 mL/m2), mild LV hypertrophy (maximal wall thickness 12 mm), hypokinesia of the basal and mid segments of the anterior and anteroseptal walls, as well as of all distal segments, and moderately depressed LV function.\nThe patient underwent coronary CT angiography that showed an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). This was associated with a dilated right coronary artery (RCA) with extensive collateral network (Figure ). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging demonstrated subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement in the anterior wall and mid-distal anteroseptum, with transmural extension in the medium segment of anterior wall (Figure ). Furthermore, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) showed extensive peri-infarct ischemia involving anterolateral wall, middle segment of inferoseptal wall and distal segment of the inferior wall (Figure ).\nAn invasive coronary angiography was performed, and retrograde filling of the LCA territory through collaterals arising from an enlarged RCA was apparent (Figure ).\nDuring hospitalization the patient remained hemodynamically stable. She underwent surgical treatment by the creation of a poly-tetrahydrofuran (pTHF) conduct connecting the aorta and left coronary artery (Figure ). Communication between the main pulmonary artery and left coronary artery was closed with bovine pericardial patch.

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presented with insidiously progressing abdominal distension of one year\u2019s duration. Review of systems was significant for colicky abdominal pain, fatigue, night sweating and anorexia. The woman had no history of fever, jaundice, tuberculosis contact, weight loss or lower limb swelling. She was not on any medications. Her surgical history included laparoscopic gastric banding surgery for obesity (body mass index = 50; weight, 120 kg) 4 years earlier without complications. The patient had received normal saline injections through an injection port underneath the skin in the first 2 years after surgery to tighten the band. She had lost 50 kg since surgery. She was single, a graphic designer, and a smoker. Her menses were regular and there was no family history of malignancy. The patient\u2019s blood pressure on admission was 110/78 mmHg, her pulse was 82 bpm, her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and her temperature was 36.8\u00b0C. There were no palpable lymph nodes, pallor, jaundice, or other stigmata of chronic liver disease. Abdominal examination revealed a distended soft lax abdomen, a tender epigastrium on deep palpation with no guarding or rigidity, positive shifting dullness, and otherwise normal findings. Complete blood count and hepatic, coagulation and renal profiles were within normal limits and there was no proteinuria. Abdominal ultrasound showed moderate to severe ascites and normal liver size and echogenicity with a patent portal vein. Tumor marker CA 125 was high. Abdominal computed tomography showed large ascites with prominent ovaries bilaterally but no definitive mass or lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis was performed, draining 7 l. Fluid analysis showed low serum ascites albumin gradient. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Laparoscopic peritoneal and ovarian biopsies showed caseating granulomata without malignant cells or acid-fast bacilli. Acid-fast bacilli culture of the ascitic fluid and of peritoneal and ovarian biopsies grew Mycobacterium species in both Middlebrook 7H9 Broth (BACTEC MGIT 960 system) and Lowenstein-Jensen after one week of incubation. Colonies appeared smooth and greyish in Lowenstein-Jensen at a temperature of 28\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C with positive arylsulfatase test and negative ProbeTec ET test. The patient began treatment for rapidly growing Mycobacterium infection with clarithromycin, rifampicin, moxifloxacin and ethambutol. The isolate was identified by Line Probe Assay INNO-LiPA MYCOBACTERIA V2 (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) as M. chelonae complex /abscessus. The Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic used DNA sequencing and real-time PCR, per the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)\n[],to confirm that the isolate was M. abscessus, subspecies abscessus. Breakpoint susceptibility testing was performed using the CLSI recommended broth microdilution MIC method with nine drugs (amikacin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefoxitin, imipenem, linezolid, doxycycline/minocycline, clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin) [Table \n]. Breakpoints for tigecycline have not been evaluated by the CLSI for mycobacteria\n[]. The isolate was resistant to quinolones and rifampicin, and was susceptible to clarithromycin and amikacin. Rifampicin and moxifloxacin were discontinued and amikacin was started along with ethambutol and clarithromycin. Laparoscopic surgery for gastric band removal was performed. Significant inflammation with dense adhesions surrounding the entire band and black discoloration of the gastric band were noted during the procedure (Figure \n). Adhesiolysiswas performed and the band was removed. Tissue from the inflammation around the band showed granulomata and culture was positive for M. abscessus. Additional antimicrobials with potential activity against M. abscessus were added sequentially (imipenem, tigecycline and linezolid), but the patient could not tolerate them for various reasons. After 5 months of clarithromycin and ethambutol treatment supplemented with amikacin for the first 2 months, the patient had an excellent recovery and become completely asymptomatic.
