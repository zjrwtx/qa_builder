    "question": "A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination. She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.\nUpon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th\u201375th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th\u201375th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5\u20133.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4\u201348 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.\nA right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm \u00d72.2 cm\u00d72.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()\nPostoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "A 17-year-old male presented with a few days history of severe headache, visual disturbances, and a few episodes of vomiting. There was no history of fever, altered consciousness, seizures, or upper or lower limb weakness. The past medical history was unremarkable. At the time of examination, his BP was 240/130 mm Hg. The fundus examination revealed bilateral papilledema with grade 4 hypertensive changes. The neurological examination revealed normal grade 5 power in all four limbs with normally elicited deep tendon reflexes. The sensory examination was unremarkable with normal flexor plantar response bilaterally. Serum electrolytes were normal; kidney function tests were deranged (blood urea 86 mg/dL, serum creatinine 3.7 mg/dL). A renal biopsy revealed features of IgA nephropathy. MRI of the brain revealed a hyperintense signal of medulla and cervical cord on T2 and FLAIR images (Figures ); small hyperintense foci were also noted in the parieto-occipital regions and deep cerebellar white matter. The lesions were also hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (because of T2 shine-through); there was no evidence of restricted diffusion on apparent diffusion co-efficient maps. As there was no clinical or lab evidence to support the diagnosis of encephalomyelitis or acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) as suggested initially by the radiologist, an atypical variant of PRES was considered as the most plausible diagnostic possibility. Further investigations including CSF studies were not considered necessary in view of the strongly suggestive clinical and imaging features. The patient rapidly improved with antihypertensive treatment and a repeat MRI done 1 month afterward showed resolution of the earlier imaging findings.

    "question": "A 78-year-old man visited our emergency room with unconsciousness. According to his family, he was poisoned with pesticide (glyphosate) for self-injury purpose. Two years ago, he had a history of cerebral infarction, and he was taking aspirin and medication for hypertension. During gastric lavage in the local clinic emergency room, his heart rate and respiration decreased. Then, he was transferred to the intensive care unit after intubation.\nIntensive care such as continuous renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation was performed in the intensive care unit, and colistin and minocycline were administered for pneumonia. Pulmonary thromboembolism was confirmed by chest computed tomography (CT), and anticoagulant therapy was performed. Acute acalculous cholecystitis occurred simultaneously, and a percutaneous transhepatic GB drainage tube was inserted.\nAfter 2 months of intensive treatment, the patient's condition improved, and cholecystectomy was planned. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and there were no remarkable details of the surgery.\nOn the first day postoperatively, the drainage changed to bile. The patient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 160/105 mm Hg; pulse rate, 143 beats/min; respiratory rate, 37 breaths/min; and body temperature, 39\u00b0C. There was tenderness and rebound tenderness in the whole abdomen, and CT showed pneumoperitoneum and diffuse fluid collection in the right perihepatic space (Figure ). We diagnosed him as having bile peritonitis, and reoperation was decided.\nOn relaparoscopic examination, there was a large amount of bile juice around the GB bed and perihepatic space, and suction and irrigation were performed. The cystic duct stump was confirmed, but there was no leakage. In the GB bed, a leak was observed in a small duct-like structure, which was regarded as an aberrant duct, and the operation was terminated after primary repair (Figure ).\nUntil 6 days postoperatively, hemoserous fluid was drained from the drainage tube. However, from postoperative day 7, the fluid changed to bile, and a percutaneous drainage (PCD) catheter was inserted into the GB bed area after performing CT.\nOn postoperative day 9, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed, and a leak was detected in the branch of the right posterior hepatic duct, which was regarded as an aberrant subvesical bile duct (Figure ). Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and insertion of an endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) stent (7 French, 5 cm) were performed (Figure ).\nOne month after ERBD stent insertion, ERCP was performed again to confirm that there was no leak, and then, the ERBD stent was removed (Figure ).

When he hyper-flexed his left hip joint, he felt and heard a crack. Initially about one week later, he referred to the local hospital because of persisting hip pain. On radiographic evaluation, he diagnosed as pelvic bone fracture and recommended for further evaluation. However, he refused to get more examination due to the alleviation of the hip pain. Although he got rest without any military training for the next six weeks, there was no improvement and tingling sense developed over the posterior aspect of left thigh. During the first consultation with the patient, he complained difficulty on sustained standing and sitting on a locked position.\nHis body weight, height, hip and lumbar T-score for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan were 76 kg, 183 cm, \u20130.7 and \u20130.1 respectively. On physical examinations, there was no limitation on range of motion of the left hip joint. Also he could walk without any pain except mild tenderness on the area distal from the ischial tuberosity. On the radiographs of the pelvis anteroposterior and frog leg view (), there was a 35\u00d740\u00d720 mm sized bony fragment, 15 mm distance from the left ischial tuberosity. After the patient admitted to our hospital, he had an examination of computed tomography () and magnetic resonance imaging for rule out pathologic conditions. There was a bony fragment at left ischial tuberosity, which was mainly from conjoined origin of biceps femoris and semitendinosus tendons without any bone marrow edema (). Overall, he diagnosed as old avulsion fracture at ischial tuberosity. He determined to get conservative treatment on condition of a gradual alleviation of the symptom. During the admitted 2 months, he just got rest and high intensity laser therapy. Thanks to the improvement except discomfort on running, he discharged and returned to his military unit.

    "question": "A 32-year-old male presented with acute abdominal pain, reduced urine output and red urine since three days. No fever, vomiting or bowel or bladder symptoms were observed. The pain in the abdomen was diffuse and more as discomfort, which started following a jerk while the patient was traveling in a bus. No prior history of diabetes, hypertension or renal disease was reported.\nInvestigations conducted in a local hospital had revealed numerous red blood corpuscles (RBCs) and white blood corpuscles (WBCs) in urine sediment and 4 + proteinuria. Ultrasound showed moderate ascites. Plain computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed hepatomegaly with ascites. Serum creatinine measured the following day was high (4.0 mg/dl); hence, an opinion from a nephrologist was sought.\nUpon examination, he was anxious and hemodynamically stable. The lungs were clear and abdominal distension and ascites was present. Pedal edema was absent. Following are the reports of the investigation carried out: hemoglobin, 17.6 g/dl; total leucocyte count, 20100 cells/m3; differential count polymorphs, 79%; lymphocytes, 17%; eosinophils and monocytes, 2% each; urine showed 3 + protein; 6-8 WBCs and numerous RBCs; arterial blood gas analysis pH, 7.31; bicarbonate, 10.8 meq/l; pCo2, 22.2 mmHg; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 60 mg/dl; creatinine, 5.9 mg/dl; sodium, 131 meq/l; potassium, 5.1 meq/l; calcium, 8.6 mg/dl; phosphorus, 6.7 mg/dl; uric acid, 10.2 mg/dl; total bilirubin, 0.3 mg/dl; protein, 8.0 g/dl; albumin, 4.2 g/dl; serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), 38 u/l; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), 25 u/l; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 96 u/l.\nWe suspected intraperitoneal rupture of the urinary bladder because of the abrupt onset of symptoms. We performed catheterization of the urinary bladder, draining 3.5 l of hemorrhagic fluid. Abdominal distension began to regress and the patient started feeling relieved after this drainage. Cystogram showed leakage of the contrast into the peritoneal cavity []. Ascitic fluid creatinine and urea nitrogen approximated the values that are usually observed in urine samples rather than in blood (86 mg/dl and 425 mg/dl, respectively).\nFollowing this confirmation, the patient underwent emergency laparotomy. A 5-mm tear was found in the dome of bladder, which was repaired in two layers. He was maintained on indwelling urethral and suprapubic Foley catheters.

    "question": "A 39-year-old female patient, who had black stool twice without obvious inducement 3 days ago, accompanied by dizziness, and no other symptoms such as abdominal distension, abdominal pain, cold, and fever. After symptomatic treatment in the local hospital, the condition did not improve, so came to our hospital for further treatment and was hospitalized with gastrointestinal bleeding. Physical examination: T 36.7\u202f\u00b0C, P 78/min, R 20/min, BP 99/62 mmHg, moderate anemia (Hb 85 g/L), no other abnormal signs and previous history of other diseases. After admission, through the preliminary examination of abdominal CT scanning, the results showed that hepatic cysts, small calcifications in the left lobe of the liver, and gallbladder inflammation, but no abnormalities in the intestinal tract. Subsequently, through electronic gastroscopy and enteroscopy, the results of the gastroscopy showed that patchy erythema could be seen in the gastric antrum, while in other parts of the stomach, the mucosa was smooth, the folds were intact, and the gastric peristalsis was good, which was diagnosed as superficial gastritis. The enteroscopy showed that, when the electronic enteroscope was inserted into the end of the ileum, a small amount of brown liquid could be seen, the intestinal mucosa was smooth, and the ileocecal valve is good. While a lot of coffee-like liquid could be seen in the colon cavity, but no bleeding site was found. At this time, we discussed and evaluated the relevant research results and case data, and highly suspected the possibility of intestinal vascular disease. In order to make a clear diagnosis and locate the bleeding site, further capsule endoscopy was performed (the whole photography time of capsule endoscopy was 11 h and 30 min). After the capsule endoscopy was swallowed, it was sent to the duodenum under the gastroscope, and entered the colon in 3 h and 27 min. Fortunately, some gains were obtained, at 48 min, there were a lot of fluid and blood clots in the upper and middle segment of the jejunum could be seen, but the entire field of vision was poorly blurred and no bleeding point was still found (). Through the results of capsule endoscopy, we were full of confidence in the previous judgment, and initially positioned the bleeding site in the jejunum.\nAfter a week of treatment through nutritional support, rehydration and correction of anemia, the patient still had recurrent and intermittent black stool, and her condition was not very stable. Therefore, we decided to explore by laparotomy []. Based on the results of capsule endoscopy, the dark black part of the jejunum was found, and then the jejunum was cut at about 5 cm above it for intraoperative enteroscopy. The bleeding spot was finally found (located at about 10 cm from jejunum to the ligament of Traitz) and then the hemostasis was stopped by suture. Finally, it was diagnosed as jejunal telangiectasia complicated with bleeding (). After hemostasis during the operation, a thorough and careful exploration of other intestines was performed, and no other bleeding sites were found. After operation, the patient's condition was stable and the symptoms of hematochezia and anemia were controlled through symptomatic treatment.

The patient reported his back pain began four days ago when he was at work and tried to lift a 100 lb instrument. The patient went to see a chiropractor, but there was no improvement with his back pain. He then started to experience left thigh and buttock pain along with the back pain for which he took eight ibuprofen tablets a day (1600 mg) for four days before presenting to the hospital. He denies taking ibuprofen for any other pain that he experienced in the past.\nWhile in the emergency room, the initial labs revealed creatinine of 32mg/dL, BUN of 175mg/dL, Na of 128 mEq/L, K of 4.5mmol/L, Cl of 90mEq/L, Co2 of 17.0mEq/L, anion gap of 21, Ca of 7.9mEq/L, and a total creatine kinase of 1315 micromoles/L. His liver function tests (LFTs) were also elevated - serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 104 units, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 281 units. His urinalysis showed 3+ blood and 2+ protein but 0-5 red blood cells. Left lower extremity Doppler ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. There was fatty infiltration of the liver and thickening of the bladder wall, and diffuse soft tissue edema involving the left hip. The patient was given ondansetron hydrochloride (Zofran\u00ae Injection) 4 mg intravenously (IV) Q6H PRN for nausea, oxycodone hydrochloride (Roxicodone\u00ae) 5 mg PO Q4H PRN for pain, morphine sulfate 2 mg IV Q2H PRN for severe back pain, hydralazine hydrochloride (Apresoline\u00ae Injection) 10 mg IV Q4H PRN for hypertension, ceftriaxone sodium 1 gm/ (sodium chloride) 100 mls at 200 mls/hr IV Q24H at 1900 SCH for cystitis, and sodium bicarbonate 150 meq/ (dextrose) 1,150 mls at 150 mls/hr IV, Q7H40M SCH. Acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis was the impression on evaluation in the ED.\nLater the patient was moved to the telemetry unit to be followed up with the hospitalist. The patient was monitored by an internist, and a nephrology consultation was requested. On the following day, during the nephrology consultation, the patient's laboratory values were as shown in Tables -. The patient's vitals are mentioned in Table . CT scan and renal ultrasound of the kidneys were ordered. CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. The nephrologist's recommendation was to continue the patient on the IV fluids with bicarbonate and avoid nephrotoxins. The nephrologist closely monitored the patient, and the plan was to place the patient on temporary dialysis if the kidney function doesn't show improvement.\nOn a subsequent day on follow up with the internist, the kidney function tests were not improving; upon discussion with the nephrologist, a temporary dialysis catheter order was placed. On the same day, an interventional radiologist placed a right internal jugular vein (IJV) temporary dialysis catheter, and the patient went for the first round of hemodialysis treatment, after which the creatinine level went down to 18 mg/dl. Urinalysis was positive for protein and red blood cells, and the labs of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 1315 micromoles/L pointed towards rhabdomyolysis. The next day during the nephrology consultation, it was recommended to go for the second round of hemodialysis. The patient's lab showed phosphorus of 11.60 mg/dL, leading to sevelamer 800 mg PO TID initiation. The patient underwent another four rounds of hemodialysis, and the kidney function tests showed a creatinine level of 11.92 mg/dL.\nThe patient subsequently went through hemodialysis for the seventh time, but his kidney function had not yet returned to the normal level. The nephrologist ordered a tunneled dialysis catheter to be placed on the patient to be able to receive outpatient dialysis once he is discharged, which was also placed by an interventional radiologist. His labs were checked again, and the results showed that his CPK, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia were resolving to normal, but the creatinine stayed stable at a high level of 10.6 mg/dL. Due to the lack of improvement in the kidney function tests towards normal range, the nephrologist ordered a renal biopsy. A day later, a kidney biopsy was done (Figure ), which showed acute interstitial nephritis with very minimal chronicity, and the patient was started on prednisone 60 mg once a day. Because of the lack of improvement on the kidney function test to normal levels, the patient was declared to have end-stage renal disease and was discharged with the outpatient dialysis treatment program and to follow up with the nephrologist.

    "question": "We report the case of a 20-year-old Caucasian, nonsmoking female student, height 185 cm, weight 66 kg, who developed pain of the left pinna which is why she attended the otolaryngological ambulatory unit two days later (). The left pinna was found to be sore and reddish but without vesicles, which is why chondritis was diagnosed and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid prescribed. One day later she awaked with a peripheral facial nerve palsy on the left side and hypoesthesia of the left upper lip. The weeks before onset she had a lot of stress with her studies at the university but there was no fever, no vaccination, or infection. A few days before onset of the palsy she recognised dysesthesias of the parietal skull on the left side. The night before onset of the palsy she was exposed against the ventilator of an air condition for more than an hour. She was regularly taking loratadine.\nClinical neurologic examination on admission revealed slight hypoesthesia of the left upper lip, moderate peripheral facial nerve palsy, and generally reduced tendon reflexes. The left pinna showed an erythematous rash but no vesicles. Hearing and taste were normal and there was no vertigo, double vision, skew deviation, nystagmus, headache, hyposmia, or ataxia []. Blood chemical investigations revealed slight leucopenia but normal C-reactive protein. Ophthalmologic examinations excluded a zoster of the eye. Immediately after admission, she was treated with dexamethasone (40 mg intramuscularly) during two days followed by dexamethasone orally during another six days. Additionally, she received 750 mg acyclovir three times a day intravenously during eight days. For continuous pain periauricularly she received mefenamic acid and paracetamol with success.\nAt followup three days later she reported some transient vesicles at the left pinna, no longer visible at the visit, lid closure had improved, and there was recovery from the pinna's rash but only marginal voluntary innervation of the frontalis and lower facial muscles. Audiometry was normal. Followup six days after onset of the palsy showed complete lid closure but unchanged innervation of the other facial muscles. She reported neuralgiform pain in the left ear which is why gabapentin was prescribed with success. Eleven days after onset of facial palsy lid closure on the left side was complete. There were slight innervation of the frontal branch and only slight innervation of the left mouth corner. Nerve conduction studies 12 days after onset showed almost equal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude when recording from the orbicularis oculi muscle but >50% amplitude reduction on the left side when recording from the orbicularis oris muscle. Antibodies against the varicella zoster virus (VZV) were determined three times by means of an ELISA test. IgG antibodies against VZV were positive at all three determinations and IgM antibodies against VZV were negative at the first and positive at the second and third determination, which is why valacyclovir orally was given for seven days after discontinuation of acyclovir. Antibodies against other viruses and Borrelia burgdorferi were normal. Follow-up 6 weeks after onset showed further recovery of the palsy, such that it was no longer visible in the absence of emotional reactions. Nerve conduction studies confirmed the improvement such that the CMAP amplitude difference was only reduced to 30%.

    "question": "A 17-year-old girl visited Chungbuk National University Hospital, presenting with fever and abdominal pain that had developed 7 days previously. She had undergone an operation for gastroschisis repair at birth. At the time of admission, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; pulse rate, 70 beats per minute; respiration rate, 18 breaths per minute; and body temperature, 37.5\u2103. She appeared emaciated and acutely ill. Her body mass index was 18.1 (height, 151 cm; and weight, 41.3 kg). A physical examination revealed icteric sclera, a very thin abdominal cavity, and a longitudinal surgical scar at the midline. Tenderness was noted in the upper abdominal area, and normal bowel sounds were heard. There was no particular finding in the limb or neurological examinations. Laboratory analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 27,000 cells/mm3; hemoglobin level, 12.3 g/dL; platelet count, 277,000 cells/mm3; aspartate aminotransferase level, 108 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase level, 144 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase level, 476 IU/L; total protein level, 6.5 g/dL; albumin level, 3.7 g/dL; total bilirubin level, 14.1 mg/dL; direct bilirubin level, 9.2 mg/dL; amylase level, 592 U/L; lipase level, 825 U/L; blood urea nitrogen level, 5.0 mg/dL; and creatinine level, 0.5 mg/dL. These data were compatible with diagnoses of acute cholangitis and acute biliary pancreatitis. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a round calcifying lesion near the pancreas (), and the absence of the retroperitoneal duodenum and the anterior position of the spleen with respect to the left kidney. The anterior and left-sided position of the superior mesenteric vein compared with that of the superior mesenteric artery was observed in the abdominal computed tomography scan (). The coronal view revealed the distorted architecture of the liver and a high-attenuation lesion at the extrahepatic bile duct (). Results of a barium examination revealed a right-sided duodenojejunal flexure and malpositioning of the bowel, with the small bowel on the right side and the colon on the left side (). Intestinal malrotation could be diagnosed based on these findings. ERCP was performed by using a lateral-view endoscope in the usual way. After approaching the ampulla, the endoscope was pushed against the duodenal wall to maintain the papilla in the correct position, and a selective bile duct cannulation confirmed the presence of a 12-mm round stone in the common bile duct. With a guidewire-assisted technique, the single dark brown stone was removed by using a Dormia basket after the endoscopic sphincterotomy (). The procedure lasted for 15 minutes. A cholangiogram obtained through an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube revealed a distorted biliary system, which was characterized with diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, downward-positioned gallbladder and a right intrahepatic biliary tree, and a horizontally located common bile duct. The abnormal orientation of the duodenum suggested intestinal malrotation (). Clinical symptoms and liver function tests normalized after the ERCP procedure.

No obvious causes of the vomiting were identified. Approximately 2 years prior to admission, the patient exhibited hyperpigmentation of the lips, in addition to fatigue, with a slow/stagnating increase in weight and height.\nOne month prior to admission, the patient had a seizure and was diagnosed with secondary epilepsy, based on an abnormal EEG. The patient was successfully treated with Topamax but continued to vomit >10 times/day. The patient was G2P2 with full-term normal delivery and a birth weight of 3.35 kg. The intellectual and physical development of the patient was similar to that of healthy children of the same age. There was no family history of genetic diseases, and the parents were in a non-consanguineous marriage.\nThe findings of the physical examination were as follows: BP, 85/55 mmHg; height, 92.7 cm; weight, 12 kg. The patient was mentally alert, and no significant anomalies were observed in the heart, lungs, abdomen, nervous system or external genitalia. A generalized hyperpigmentation was observed. Esophagography showed achalasia of the lower esophagus at the cardia. In the hospital, the patient was observed not to produce tears when crying. The results of a bilateral Schirmer test were 0 mm, which led to the diagnosis of alacrima. Further medical history confirmed that the alacrima had manifested at birth. Following the diagnosis of AS, the patient was treated with hydrocortisone replacement therapy (25 mg/m2), and the vomiting was alleviated.

Before this incident, he had not experienced any medical complications, lived in full sanitary conditions, denied previous symptoms related to disease, did not have any pets, and denied eating raw meat. He then began hospital inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics, and third-generation cephalosporin (Ceftriaxone) and a macrolide (Clarithromycin) were prescribed for 8 days. Laboratory tests from the patient\u2019s admittance showed mild anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.7 g/dL, with normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). Other biochemical results were as follows: creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, urea 32 mg/dL, total bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, glucose 90 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 3.7 mEq/L, and C-reactive protein 138.2 mg/L. Leucocytes levels were a little low, with 2700 cells/\u03bcL. Blood and urine cultures were negative for infection and serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, and syphilis were all negative.\nOn the fourth day of this related treatment, our patient developed abdominal distension and pain in his lower right abdominal quadrant. Acute appendicitis was confirmed by ultrasound examination, and he underwent laparoscopic surgery the same day. Our patient was then taken to our intensive care unit for worsening of his clinical condition. On the fourth postoperative day, our patient developed fever associated with right pleural effusion, which was a lymphocytic exudate with an adenosine deaminase concentration of 17.99 U/L and negative culture (Fig. ). Thus, the attending physicians requested a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy. The transbronchial fluid had negative cultures for infection. At that time, the antibiotic spectrum was extended for treatment of the sepsis, including piperacillin/tazobactam for 10 days.\nAnatomopathological examination of the transbronchial biopsy specimen showed a small fragment of lung parenchyma with discrete septal thickening and a rounded structure suggestive of a pseudocyst containing Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoites (Fig. ).\nOur patient showed progressive improvement after antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, and was discharged on the 14th day after surgery. A chest radiograph showed significant improvement in lung opacification (Fig. ) and serological tests for toxoplasmosis were negative for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M.\nOur patient was followed up on an outpatient basis for 2 years without any signs of recurrence of lung infections or other comorbidities.

    "question": "In the 1998 report on the treatment of B, he was 20 years old. B had been a child with a classical gender dysphoric development and fulfilled the current criteria for GnRH analog treatment eligibility. He was interviewed shortly after his legal gender change. This meant that he had had puberty suppression, cross-sex hormone treatment, a mastectomy, ovariectomy, and uterus extirpation. From his assessment during the diagnostic phase, he appeared to be an intelligent person (IQ = 128) with excellent problem-solving capabilities with respect to emotional matters. Vulnerable aspects of his psychological functioning were his insecurity about himself and moderately depressed feelings. In all other areas, his scores on a broad range of measures were in the average range, as compared to Dutch normative samples. Shame concerning his transsexualism made him highly selective in his friendships and guarded in his contacts with new people. At the assessment, 1 year after his ovariectomy but prior to his metaidoioplasty, he no longer reported feelings of gender dysphoria. He had adjusted easily to the male role and expressed no doubts on the adequacy of his masculine behavior. After the development of his secondary male sex characteristics, nobody had ever approached him as a woman. He never felt any regrets about his decision and had never contemplated living as a girl again. Knowing what gender reassignment implied, he would do it all over again. B was happy with his life and did not feel lonely. He showed a significant pre-post treatment decrease in his feelings of inadequacy. At the time, he was attending medical school.\nB attended the pediatric endocrinology clinic for the first time when he was age 13.7 years. His medical history was uneventful. Puberty had started 1\u20132 years previously, but menarche had not occurred. On physical examination, a healthy girl was seen with a height of 157.3 cm and a Tanner pubertal stage of B3, P3. Bone age according to Tanner and Whitehouse was 13.5 years. Target height, as a female, was estimated at 171 cm, based on the parental height. Puberty suppression was induced by the GnRH analog Triptorelin, in a dose of 3.75 mg every 4 weeks intramuscularly. On this dosage, B steadily kept on growing.\nAt age 18.6 years, his height was 165.8 cm. Induction of male puberty and accompanying secondary male sex characteristics was initiated by administration of 100 mg testosterone-ester mixture intramuscularly every 2 weeks. This was, after 6 months, increased to 250 mg testosterone-ester mixture, every 2\u20133 weeks intramuscularly. At the start of the androgen treatment, the Triptorelin treatment was discontinued.\nWhen B was 20 years old, he had a subcutaneous mastectomy by way of an infra-areolar approach, a few months later followed by a hysterectomy and gonadectomy. Two years later, metaidoioplasty and testes implantation were performed.\nFifteen years after the first interview and testing session, at age 35, B was seen again at the clinic. He lived on his own and he worked as a family doctor in private practice with two colleagues. All family members knew about his transitioning as did some of his friends. He was very satisfied about his circle of friends and had never been treated negatively because of his transsexualism.\nB was still satisfied about his (minor) breast surgery, his ovariectomy, and his hysterectomy, but no longer about the metaidoioplasty he underwent one year after the first follow-up session. He did not like its size and shape and he could hardly urinate in a standing position. He was able to have orgasms, but he could not have sexual intercourse. Because of his desire to have more convincingly male appearing external genitals and his wish to be able urinate in a standing position, he considered having a phalloplasty. Despite his good looks and very masculine appearance, he had not had many steady girlfriends, which may have resulted from the guardedness he already had as an adolescent. At age 29, he had a serious relationship with a woman, which lasted for 5 years. However, he chose not to live together when the opportunity to do so arose. After his choice to continue living apart, his girlfriend ended the relationship, a few months before his interview at the clinic. This made him very much regret his lack of commitment. B considered it likely that his need to distance himself from her had been related to his shame about his genital appearance and his feelings of inadequacy in sexual matters. Additional factors, such as serious illness of his father and a suicide among his sisters\u2019 in-laws, made him rather sad at the time of the interview. Although his psychoneuroticism score on the Symptom Checklist-90 (Arrindell & Ettema, ) was in the normal range, his depression subscore was high, indicating depressed feelings. However, on the Beck Depression Inventory, he scored in the \u201cminimal range\u201d (van der Does, ), indicating that he did not fulfill criteria for clinical depression. On the Adult Self-Report, assessing adaptive functioning and problems in adults aged 18-59 years (Achenbach & Rescorla, ), all his scores were in the normal range.\nIt seems, therefore, that B functioned well in most aspects of life, but that he was still struggling with the question, how to handle the dissatisfaction and shame about his genital appearance.\nAt age 35, on physical examination, we saw a healthy and well virilized person. Blood pressure was 120/85 mmHg, final height was 169.5 cm and weight was 73 kg, which resulted in a body mass index (BMI) of 25.4 kg/m2. Sitting height was 88 cm. Skull circumference was 55.5 cm. For a comparison of his anthropometrical measurements to the normal reference values of Dutch males and females, see Table .\nA fasting venous blood sample was drawn. General health markers, like hematological parameters (Hb, ht, erythrocytes), renal function, and liver enzymes, were all within the normal reference value ranges. His lipid profile showed a total cholesterol level of 228.3 mg/dl (<251.5 mg/dl), LDL-cholesterol 154.8 mg/dl (<193.5 mg/dl), HDL-cholesterol 55.0 mg/dl (>34.8 mg/dl), and triglycerides 97.4 mg/dl (<177 mg/dl). His glucose value was 97.3 mg/dl (<144.1 mmol/l) with an insulin level of 21 pmol/l (12\u201396 pmol/l for a fasting sample). His HbA1c was 5.4% (4.3\u20136.1%). These values were in the normal range.\nWith respect to the gonadal axis, a normal-low serum testosterone level of 236.6 ng/dl (231\u2013866 ng/dl) was found. This relatively low level was probably due to the fact that the blood sample was taken just before the next testosterone-ester mixture injection. Gonadotropins were elevated as a consequence of the gonadectomy. LH and FSH were 16 U/l and 50 U/l, respectively. Additionally determined endocrine parameters, such as thyroid and adrenal function, were all within normal reference ranges.\nWith respect to bone mineral density (BMD), a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was performed to determine B\u2019s BMD in the lumbar spine, the non-dominant hip, and (further) total body. The observed values were related to the bone peak mass for white females and for white males, resulting in T-scores. For all values, the z-score was determined as well (see Table ).

Her white blood cell count was 14,500/\u00b5L (4500\u201311000/\u00b5L) with 81% neutrophils. Her chest X-ray showed multiple small nodular opacities throughout the right lung with a probable cavity in the right lung apex (Figure ). Suspicion was raised for possible active TB and she was admitted in airborne isolation. Two peripheral blood cultures, sputum culture along with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were ordered. Computed tomography (CT) chest without contrast showed multiple thick-walled cavities in the right upper lobe. The largest cavity was 7 cm. There were innumerable centrilobular nodules and tree in bud opacities throughout the right lung (Figures , ). Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus was detected by sputum AFB staining and later confirmed by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. She also had a positive QuantiFERON test. She was started on anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) medications including Isoniazid 300 mg daily, Rifampin 300 mg twice daily, Ethambutol 800 mg daily, Pyrazinamide 1000 mg daily and Pyridoxine 50 mg daily for the first two months and then two drugs Isoniazid and Rifampin for the next four months.

    "question": "A ten-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with complaints of cough, fever, vomiting, weakness and lack of appetite. She also suffered from alopecia and persistent/recurring respiratory infections. Both parents were reported to be healthy and they were consanguineous (first cousins). Their four children except for our patient were healthy.\nPhysical examination of the patient revealed normal vital signs. The percentiles of her weight and height were between the 3rd and 10th percentiles. She had pale skin, total alopecia and pitting in the nails of her hands and feet (). A crackling sound was heard during inspiration. Her puberty was stage I according to Tanner stages.\nHer hematology results revealed a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, hematocrit 19.9%, white blood cells 13200/mm3, platelets 35000/mm3, MCV 84fL and reticulocytes of 8.14%, as well as negative direct Coombs test result. Blood smear showed schistocytes (). Her biochemical investigation revealed: urea 142 mg/dL, creatinine 4.61 mg/dL, AST 97 U/L, ALT 79 U/L, LDH 2218 U/L, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.55 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 5.9 mmol/L, chloride 109 mmol/L, calcium 8.7 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.0 mg/dL, uric acid 8.0 mg/dL, ph 7.44, HCO3- 21 mmol/L and glucose 76 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed the following: pH 7.5, density 1010, protein (++), erythrocytes (+++), leucocytes (-) and dysmorphic erythrocytes in the urinary sediment.\nBased on these biochemical and urinary abnormalities, the patient was diagnosed as HUS. After seven plasma exchange sessions, the hemolysis finally stopped and the laboratory abnormalities and renal function reverted to normal. The respiratory infection was treated with appropriate antibiotic regimens.\nIn the hormonal evaluation, free thyroxine (fT4) was 1.11 ng/dL (0.8-2.2), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 3.028 mU/mL (0.6-5.5), anti-peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody 62 IU/ mL (<20), anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) antibody 65 IU/mL (<4.0), cortisol 25.5 mg/dL (3-21), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 28.1 pg/mL (10-60), estradiol 14 ng/dL (0.2.0), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 0.32 mIU/mL, luteinizing hormone (LH) 0.07 mIU/mL (0.02-0.3), anti-pancreatic islets antibody 1/100 (<1/10), parathyroid hormone (PTH) 65.9 ng/mL (10-65), renin 72 ng/L (5-35), aldosterone 248 pg/mL (20-300), vitamin B12 456 pg/mL (150-883) and folic acid 4.2 ng/mL (3.1-20.5) before plasma exchange therapy. Although thyroid ultrasonography was normal and the patient was not on Na-L-T4 treatment, both anti-TPO antibody and anti-TG antibody tests were positive. These findings suggested early diagnosed autoimmune thyroiditis. Cortisol response to ACTH stimulation test (1 \u03bcg ACTH) was as follows: initial 1 mg/dL, 30th minute 8.1 mg/dL, 60th minute 11.2 mcg/dL, 90th minute 14.1 mg/dL, and 120th 14.7 mg/dL. The cut-off level of this test was 14 mg/dL (9). These results were interpreted as a normal response to ACTH stimulation test and indicated that there was no adrenal insufficiency. In immunological evaluation, IgA was 24 mg/dL (29-384), IgM 24 mg/dL (50-278), IgG 464 mg/dL (625-1579), IgE 464 IU/mL (0-170), C3 90 mg/dL (90-180), C4 26 mg/dL (10-40), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) (-), anti-double strain DNA antibody (-), p-ANCA (-), c-ANCA (-) and anti-HBs (-) before plasma exchange therapy. Lymphocyte subsets were CD3 78% (55-78), CD19 2% (10-31), CD4 39% (27-53) and CD8 51% (19-34). The complement factor H gene region was proliferated by PCR method. Sequences which have single nucleotide polymorphism on complement factor H have been determined. CT homozygote polymorphism for His402Tyr was detected. This factor is considered to be a risk factor for development of HUS (). In radiological evaluation, pulmonary X-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltration and abdominal ultrasonography was normal except for hepatomegaly and grade I increase in renal echogenicity.

    "question": "An 18-year-old Black female who had been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, subsequently suffering frequent pain crises and undergoing repeated transfusions, presented to the emergency room with a 21-day history of progressive lower limb oedema accompanied by dyspnoea and orthopnoea. In addition, she reported a 3-day history of severe chest pain, together with a productive cough and fever as high as 38 \u00b0C. She reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, she was found to be very pallid and normotensive (blood pressure, 130/80 mmHg), with a heart rate of 104 bpm, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, as well as being found to have developed anasarca. One month prior, she had undergone outpatient laboratory tests, which had shown that her renal function was normal\u2014with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.75 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease\u2013Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD\u2013EPI) equation, of 134.9 ml/min/1.73 m2\u2014urine analysis showing no haematuria or proteinuria.\nBlood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 6.1 g/dl; haematocrit, 18.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; reticulocyte fraction, 6.11%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 433 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.36 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 18,820 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,630 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 2790 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and urea, 29 mg/dl. The patient showed signs of hyperfiltration, including a serum creatinine concentration of 0.49 mg/dl and a CKD\u2013EPI-determined eGFR of 148.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. A urine sample was found to contain 100 leucocytes/field and 70 erythrocytes/field. In addition, 24-h proteinuria was 8.99 g. Further analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 3.9 g/dl; albumin, 1.2 g/dl; globulins, 2.7 g/dl; total cholesterol, 210 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 114 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 37 mg/dl; triglycerides, 205 mg/dl; C4, 26.1 mg/dl (normal range, 10\u201338 mg/dl); C3, 62 mg/dl (normal range, 73\u2013149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 24.9 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The patient also tested negative for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia and an anti-streptolysin O level of 816 IU/ml (normal range, < 200 IU/ml). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed mild congestion and infiltrate in the right lung base. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.\nGiven the clinical presentation, the diagnostic hypothesis was pneumonia and anasarca due to nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. The patient was started on ceftriaxone (1 g, twice daily). Computed tomography angiography of the chest ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and acute chest syndrome, thus indirectly confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia.\nAfter the infection had been controlled, the patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy revealed 7 glomeruli with global endocapillary proliferation; neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate (Fig. a); synechiae in 10% of the glomeruli; occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane; and a preserved Bowman\u2019s capsule. The tubules were dilated, with foci of epithelial regeneration and neutrophils within their lumina. There was focal oedema in the interstitium. The interlobular arteries had a normal aspect, with intimal proliferation in the arterioles. Immunofluorescence performed on frozen sections showed intensity of deposition of C3 (2+/3+), IgG (1+/3+), IgA (1+/3+) and lambda light chains (1+/3+), with a granular pattern, distributed diffusely throughout the capillary loop. Collectively, the histological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of APIGN accompanied by microangiopathic changes related to the underlying disease.\nTreatment with a diuretic and an anti-proteinuric agent (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was instituted, and the patient evolved to clinical improvement (normalisation of blood pressure, as well as resolution of the proteinuria and haematuria). However, the signs of hyperfiltration persisted even after resolution of the proteinuria. In the final evaluation, the serum creatinine concentration was 0.33 mg/dl and the CKD\u2013EPI-determined eGFR was 187.8 ml/min/1.73 m2. Evolution of laboratorial tests are available in Fig. .

    "question": "A 37-year-old young female patient presented with progressive dyspnea, hypoxia, and left lung consolidation. She had presented to our emergency department, with a 3-day history of shortness of breath, fever, and nonproductive cough. Her past medical history included recently diagnosed and untreated Hepatitis C, related to prolonged intravenous heroin abuse. She was on methadone de-addiction program but was continuing to occasionally using heroin, the last time a week prior to admission. She was also an active smoker, with a 20 pack-year history.\nOn clinical examination she appeared malnourished and dehydrated, with multiple skin tattoos and burn marks on the left forearm. Temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, respiratory rate 30/Min, blood pressure 90/50 mmHg, pulse rate 120 beats/min, oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Heart sounds were dual, with no added sounds or murmurs. There were no crackles or wheezes audible on auscultation but air entry was markedly reduced on the left side. Routine laboratory investigations showed a hemoglobin of 99 g/L. white cell count 23.7 \u00d7 109/L with a neutrophil count of 22.75 \u00d7 109/L, and lymphocytes of 0.79 \u00d7 109/L, CRP 206 mg/L, Alanine transaminase (ALT) 26 U/L, Aspartate transaminase (AST) 18 U/L, urea 3.5 mmol/L, creatinine 42 \u03bcmol/L. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed complete left-sided consolidation with no mediastinal shift [Figures and ]. Venous access was obtained via central cannulation of the internal jugular vein and she was resuscitated with 2 L of normal saline, started on ticaricillin/caluvulanate 3.1 g 6 hourly and referred to intensive care unit for admission with a presumptive diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia.\nDespite adequate fluid resuscitation, the patient remained hypotensive with decreasing urine output, and noradrenalin infusion was initiated to improve blood pressure. She was intubated for worsening tachypnea and fatigue. Prior to intubation, chest computed tomography (CT) was performed, which confirmed consolidation of both the lobes on the left side; interestingly, no foreign body was described on the initial CT report, but detected on review after bronchoscopy [Figures and ]. Serology was drawn to assess for Hepatitis, HIV, and atypical infection. The antibiotic regime was augmented with the addition of vancomycin and azythromycin.\nIn view of the history of intravenous drug abuse a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which demonstrated mild tricuspid regurgitation, no vegetations, and normal cardiac function. The patient was ventilated on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation volume control mode, with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, Peak end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 and FiO2 of 0.5. There was only a minimal endotracheal aspirate and a repeat CXR showed the persistence of the left lobe consolidation with no improvement inspite of mechanical ventiltion. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed on day 2 to obtain diagnostic specimens and to look for any airway obstruction by mucous plugging. Bronchoscopy unexpectedly revealed a nearly completely obstructed left main bronchus by a foreign body, which resembled an earring. The foreign body was pulled out using a biopsy forceps. The foreign body became lodged in the endotracheal tube (ETT) necessitating removal of the ETT and foreign body en masse and reintubating the patient with a new ETT. On closer examination of the foreign body was a 25G hypodermic needle []. Subsequent CXR showed clearing of consolidation and the patient was extubated on day 4 and transferred to medical ward for further management. Sputum culture during bronchoscopy also yielded Pseudomonoas aeroginosa, which was sensitive to ticaricillin/caluvulanate. Antibiotics were de-escalated, and the patient was discharged on day 6 with oral antibiotics []. On questioning, it became apparent that she inhaled drugs from the same table she kept her drug paraphernalia. It seemed that while snorting drugs, she inadvertently inhaled the hypodermic needle.

    "question": "A 73-year-old female was brought by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department (ED) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She was driving when her car crashed into a streetlamp at 40 miles per hour. The EMS team reported that the pole intruded into the passenger compartment and the patient required a prolonged extrication. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 11 when EMS arrived at the scene, which improved to a 15 after repeated evaluations. She was conscious, alert, and oriented at the scene and during transport.\nThe patient had difficulty recalling the events before the collision. She remembered feeling \u201clike I was having a panic attack\u201d just before the crash, and she did not recall the car impacting the streetlamp. In the ED, she complained of substernal chest pressure. The patient\u2019s history was limited due to her continued difficulty recalling the events of the accident. The patient\u2019s son was contacted and he stated that she lives alone and is active and independent. He stated that she had experienced syncopal episodes over the last several years, all associated with paroxysms of panic when driving, and she had undergone extensive workups without any clear etiology identified. She had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast four years prior for stroke-like symptoms after a syncopal event. Per his report, no abnormalities were found.\nThe patient had a past medical history of anxiety, migraines, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, which was treated with a left mastectomy followed by five years of tamoxifen and letrozole treatment. She had a family history of dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. She denied using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substances. She was prescribed, and was taking, the following medications: levothyroxine 25 micrograms daily; atorvastatin 20 milligrams (mg) nightly; rizatriptan 10 mg as needed for headaches; and multivitamins.\nOn physical exam, the patient\u2019s temperature was 36.5\u00b0 Celsius, her heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 142/72 millimeters of mercury. She was breathing at a rate of 21 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She weighed 125 pounds and was 5 feet, 3 inches tall, with a body mass index of 22.1 kilograms per meter squared. She did not appear to be in any acute distress, was healthy appearing, and was oriented to her name, date, and location. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic; she had no Battle sign, raccoon eyes, or other signs of trauma. She had hearing aids in place bilaterally. She had normal extraocular movements with equal pupils that were reactive to light. She had a cervical collar in place. Later, when it was safe to remove her collar, her neck had a normal range of motion without rigidity or pain.\nOn auscultation, her heart had a regular S1 and S2 at a normal rate and was without murmurs. She had normal pulses bilaterally. Her lungs were clear without wheezing or rhonchi, and she was noted to have normal effort without respiratory distress. Her abdomen was soft and flat, without tenderness or guarding. Her musculoskeletal exam showed an overall normal range of motion without deformities. She had no step-offs of the spinous processes or tenderness along the midline spine. The remainder of her skeletal exam only revealed tenderness over the left wrist. She had a capillary refill of less than two seconds. On her skin exam, she had minor contusions to the left upper chest near the axilla with superficial abrasions along the left wrist. She was not diaphoretic. Neurologically she had no cranial nerve deficits, with no motor weakness or sensory deficits peripherally. She had a normal gait and normal coordination as well. She could not recall her birth date and had slow verbalization with some word-finding difficulty. Psychiatrically, she was normal in mood and behavior.\nPoint-of care-ultrasound did not find evidence of free fluid within the abdominal or thoracic cavities and was negative for a pericardial effusion. Point-of-care ultrasound examination of her chest revealed normal lung sliding bilaterally. Chest radiograph showed no acute abnormalities. A radiograph of her pelvis showed no fracture or malalignment of the bones. A computed tomography (CT) of her head and brain showed no intracranial injury. A CT of the cervical spine and chest with contrast in the arterial phase was performed, which showed normal vertebral body height and alignment without fracture. The CT did show some mild atherosclerosis of the carotid and vertebral arteries, but no vascular injury and no obvious narrowing. Her trachea and mainstem bronchi were patent, she had no mediastinal abnormalities, the thoracic aorta was normal in appearance, and she had no pericardial effusion or pneumothorax ().\nA CT of her abdomen and pelvis with contrast in the venous phase was also performed, which showed patent vasculature including a normal caliber aorta and inferior vena cava, normal appearing spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys/ureters, a small hiatal hernia but otherwise normal appearing bowel, and no ascites or pneumoperitoneum. The radiologist did not find any fractures on her imaging or any soft tissue injuries.

On admission, his vital signs were a blood pressure of 144/83 mmHg, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, O2 saturation of 40% (room air), and temperature of 38 \u00b0C. On physical examination, he was found to be febrile, somnolent, and polypneic, with marked respiratory effort. Emergency orotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit were necessary.\nInitial screening showed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 138 \u00d7 103 cells/\u00b5l), leukocytosis (WBC 15,760 cells/ml, 90% neutrophils) with lymphopenia (6.20% lymphocytes), elevated transaminases (ALT 1507.4 IU and AST 3049.7 IU), elevated d-dimer (44,066 \u00b5g/ml), and negative RT-PCR SARS CoV-2 test. Chest X-ray showed extensive interstitial infiltrates in both lung fields (Fig. b). Considering the progressive decrease in total platelet count as well as gradual lymphopenia (Fig. ), a dengue IgM/IgG test was conducted and was positive, while the dengue PCR-RT test was negative. According to radiographic findings and respiratory involvement, the RT-PCR test for SARS CoV-2 was repeated on two more occasions, with negative results. Therefore, IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 were assayed and were positive.\nPositive serology for both SARS CoV-2 and dengue virus confirmed coinfection, so it was considered that he had probably entered a late stage of the disease. Steroid management was indicated according to COVID-19 management guidelines, in addition to pronation cycles, to which he presented poor response and persistent hypoxemia. During his stay in intensive care, he presented multiple complications, such as acute pulmonary embolism, with signs of secondary thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, bacterial superinfection in his lungs by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Akin III acute renal failure. Computerized tomography angiography of the chest was performed, which confirmed acute pulmonary thromboembolism of multiple bilateral lobar and segmental bilateral branches with signs of secondary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary changes suggestive of organizing pneumonia secondary to viral infection (Fig. ). Details of the clinical description of the coinfection are presented in Table . The patient remained in the ICU for COVID-19, bacterial superinfection, and dengue with alarm signs for 63 days.

    "question": "The patient was a 34-year-old Japanese man, whose family history included a father with hypertension, and a mother that suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, but which did not include either a consanguineous marriage or any incidence of renal cysts. At the age of 31, the patient presented with mild albuminuria, and a serum creatinine (Cr) level of 2.98 mg/dL. At the age of 34, the patient was admitted to hospital with a creatinine level of 8.2 mg/dL.\nUpon admission, the patient's height, weight, and blood pressure were 179 cm, 58 kg, and 126/80 mm Hg, respectively. The patient exhibited anemia (Hb 8.2 g/dL), azotemia (Cr 8.38 mg/dL), hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and secondary hyperparathyroidism; thus, he was diagnosed with ESRD. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed that, although the size of both kidneys appeared to be normal, the patient's renal parenchyma showed increased brightness. We performed a percutaneous renal biopsy; histologically, six of 16 glomeruli displayed global sclerosis, along with mild cellular infiltration, conspicuous interstitial fibrosis, renal tubular atrophy, and cystoid irregular dilation (Figure ), suggesting an NPHP diagnosis. We performed targeted sequencing using a next-generation sequencer, with the approval by the research ethics committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the patient's written informed consent. A homozygous full gene deletion of NPHP1 (NM_000272.3:g110879716-110962709) was resultantly identified, as well as heterozygous substitutions in PKD1 (NM_0001009944.2:c.6395T>G(p.Phe2132Cys)) (Figure ), BBS1 (NM_024649.4:c.908T>C(p.Val303Ala)), and INPP5E (NM_019892.4:c.1652C>T(p.Thr551Met)).

    "question": "A 3.5-year-old girl was transferred to our institution from a local hospital with abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for further investigation and management. The child was diagnosed with isovaleric acidemia in the neonatal period, because there was a positive family history of a sibling death from this inherited disorder. Hence, measurement of elevated concentrations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma by mass spectrometry [] was performed after birth; then, isovaleric acid CoA dehydrogenase deficiency was confirmed by assaying its enzymatic activity in cultured skin fibroblasts [].\nThe child was admitted to the local hospital two days ago because of new-onset upper abdominal pain. Although she was unable to describe the nature and character of the pain, it was not severe enough to require analgesics. One day prior to her admission to us, she developed vomiting that eventually became bilious.\nThe patient who had normal growth and development was on oral L-carnitine supplementation since infancy. Beside that, she was not receiving any other medications. Her family history was negative for pancreatitis. On admission to us, she was afebrile with normal vital signs. On physical examination, there was moderate upper abdominal tenderness without rebound, while she had normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Laboratory studies on admission revealed the following: leukocytes 10,110/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 14 g/dL, hematocrit 37.2%, platelets 169,000/\u03bcL, glucose 185 mg/dL (normal < 100 mg/dL), urea 26 mg/dL, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 3.6 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, AST 34 U/L, ALT 22 U/L, LDH 426 U/L (normal < 280 U/L), albumin 4.3 g/dL, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, \u03b3-GT 16 U/L, triglycerides 80 mg/dL, calcium 10 mg/dL, and amylase 536 U/L (normal 40\u2013140 U/L). Arterial blood gases showed the following: pH 7.55, pCO2 21 mmHg, pO2 133 mmHg, HCO3 23 mmol/L, and base deficit 3.8 mmol/L. The anion gap was estimated at 7. A coagulation profile and a urine analysis were normal.\nDue to the bilious nature of vomiting, an abdominal ultrasound () was obtained that showed a notably enlarged and edematous pancreas, along with the presence of peripancreatic exudates that were extending bilaterally towards the anterior paranephric spaces and towards the right colon. The wall of the duodenum was also diffusely edematous. No gallstones were seen, the bile duct was not distended, and there was no sludge in it, while the liver, spleen, and appendix were visualized without echomorphologic abnormalities.\nSince the goal of management of acute pancreatitis is to achieve analgesia, adequate rehydration, and organ rest, the child was managed with discontinuation of oral feedings, placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous hydration with 5% dextrose with electrolytes, and administration of intravenous ranitidine and of L-carnitine, 500 mg every 8 hours, that is, approximately 100 mg/kg/day.\nThe patient's clinical course was uncomplicated. Serum amylase normalized (84 U/L) on the 4th hospital day. She was fed with a low-fat and protein diet on the 6th hospital day. On the same day, the intravenous fluids were discontinued. Two follow-up ultrasonographic examinations on the 3rd and 5th () hospital days showed progressive but rapid resolution of the pancreatic edema and of the peripancreatic exudates. Due to substantial clinical improvement, with complete disappearance of the abdominal pain, the child was discharged home without any complaints on the 8th hospital day.

    "question": "A 43 year-old male was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital after his workplace colleagues noted increasingly strange behavior for three days. The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient\u2019s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.\nThough initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.\nIn the ED, the patient\u2019s temperature was 103.9\u00b0F (39.9\u00b0C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.\nInitial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0\u201310.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0\u201318.0], platelet count of 135 \u00d7 103/mm3 [lab range 150\u2013350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137\u2013145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98\u2013107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0\u201330.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9\u201320], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7\u20131.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70\u201399], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0\u201310]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0\u20130.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38\u2013126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13\u201369), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15\u201346). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5\u201310 WBC, 0\u20135 red blood cells (RBC), 5\u201310 epithelial cells, 5\u201310 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40\u201370], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12\u201360], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient\u2019s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient\u2019s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 \u03bcg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137\u2013145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98\u2013107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0\u201330.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9\u201320], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7\u20131.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70\u201399], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0\u201310]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0\u20130.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38\u2013126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13\u201369), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15\u201346). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5\u201310 WBC, 0\u20135 red blood cells (RBC), 5\u201310 epithelial cells, 5\u201310 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40\u201370], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12\u201360], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient\u2019s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient\u2019s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",
