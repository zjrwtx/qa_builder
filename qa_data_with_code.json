    "question": "A 56-year-old man was admitted to the renal unit of the tertiary university hospital with symptoms of polyuria with nocturia, and polydipsia with severe thirst for the past 2 months. Initially, the patient visited a local clinic and was diagnosed as type 2 DM with a fasting blood sugar, 150mg/dL. Despite being controlled hyperglycemia with an oral hypoglycemic agent, he continued drinking daily more than 8 L of cold water (about 10 bottles of refrigerated water, 750 ml capacity) and passed large amounts of urine frequently. He had no specific history including head trauma or mental disorder, and denied any pertinent family history. The patient showed no signs of systemic illness such as fever or arthralgia, or neurologic symptoms involving the central nervous system. He has been working as a gardener with 176 cm in height and 68 kg in weight (71 kg before this event). The physical examination was unremarkable with blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, pulse rate of 80/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and temperature of 36.8\u2103. In the laboratory findings, his white blood cell count was 9,700/mm3; hemoglobin, 13.4 g/dL; platelet, 376\u00d7103/mm3; sodium, 140 mEq/L; potassium, 3.8 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 12 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL and osmolality 295 mOsm/kg water. HbA1c was 7.2% and post-prandial glucose was checked around 180mg/dl with fasting blood sugar of 140 mg/dL. In urine analysis, the urine pH was 6.0; specific gravity 1.006; albumin (-); glucose (-); WBC 0-4/HPF; RBC 0-2/HPF, and osmolality 140mOsm/kg water. Fluid intake and output in 24 hours recorded 9 L in oral water intake from water containers and 11.7 L in urine output. In hormone assays, ACTH was 25.2 pg/mL (reference value, 6.0-76.0 pg/mL), prolactin 8 \u00b5g/L (reference value, 0-15 \u00b5g/L), cortisol 9.8 \u00b5g/dL (referencel value, 5-25 \u00b5g/dL), hGH 2.26 ng/mL (reference value, 0.5-17 ng/mL), and TSH 0.99 \u00b5U/mL (reference value, 0.5-4.7 \u00b5U/mL). Also, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was within normal range (reference value, <40 U/L).\nOn hospital day 5, the patient underwent a water deprivation test according to the method of Miller-Moses test because of persistent polydipsia and polyuria despite blood glucose control. The results are shown in . During dehydration, the patient lost 3kg (4.4% of body weight), and urine osmolality remained hypotonic below 130 mOsm/kg. Basal ADH level was 5.18 pg/dL, and the repeat ADH level following the stimulation by water deprivation was 3.95 pg/dL, which revealed no increment despite the increased serum osmolality up to 300 mOsm/kg from the baseline levels of 285 to 295 mOsm/kg. One puff (5 \u00b5g) of desmopressin nasal spray resulted in the increase of urine osmolality to 266 mOsm/kg (>100% increase from the baseline level, 126 mOsm/kg) and in the marked reduction of urine output from 200-410 ml/hr to 44-60 ml/hr. These results were compatible with CDI,, whose causes would be mostly idiopathic because of normal findings in hypothalamus and hypophysis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of sella ().\nOn discharge (hospital day 9), the dose of desmopressin nasal spray (minirin nasal spray\u00ae) was adjusted to 1 puff per 12 hrs (10 \u00b5g/day), and urine output was markedly reduced to below 2-3 L/day with no more intense thirst. Also, DM was controlled with fasting blood sugar below 115 mg/dL by metformin (novamet GR\u00ae 500mg bid) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended diet.

    "question": "In 2008, a 59-year-old Japanese woman was admitted for evaluation of renal disease. RA had been diagnosed at another hospital in 1972 when she presented with bilateral arthropathy of the hands, knees, ankles, and feet. Treatment was started with a combination of a gold preparation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but was not been effective. Prednisolone (PSL; 15 mg daily) and bucillamine (BUC; 200 mg daily) were started in 1987, but her disease remained active. Methotrexate (MTX; 5 mg daily) was started in 1995 but was discontinued because of nausea. In 2002, urinary protein was found to be positive by a dipstick urine test, and BUC was stopped. Then treatment was continued with PSL (5 mg/day) and loxoprofen (50 mg/day). However, urinary protein excretion increased in 2007, and serum creatinine (Cre) was elevated to 1.96 mg/dL.\nOn admission, the patient was 154.2 cm tall and weighed 44.0 kg, with a blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg and temperature of 36.4 \u00b0C. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities of the heart and lungs. The joints of her hands, knees, ankles, and feet showed bilateral swelling and deformity. In addition, the lower extremities were edematous. Her cervical spine was unstable, with flexion causing numbness in the upper limbs.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: serum Cre was 4.2 mg/dL, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 9.3 mL/min/1.73m3, C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.9 mg/dL, and SAA was 43.2. In addition, rheumatoid factor (RF) was positive at 59 U/mL (normal: < 10), and cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies were positive at 218.5 (normal < 4.5). 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 6.5 g, and the urine sediment contained 1 \u2013 5 red cells per high-power field (HPF). The disease activity score (DAS)-CRP was 7.1. Radiographs showed deformation of the finger and foot joints as well as atlantoaxial joint subluxation. Renal biopsy was performed for evaluation of her kidney disease.\nRenal biopsy\nLight microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen containing 4 glomeruli revealed global sclerosis in all 4. There was severe tubular atrophy, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis occupied ~ 95% of the entire renal cortex. All 4 glomeruli contained multinodular structures of amorphous material with a PAM-positive border. This material was positive for Congo-red and amyloid A, but was negative for \u03ba and \u03bb chains, \u03b2-2 microglobulin, and transthyretin (). Electron microscopy showed randomly arranged fibrils measuring 8 \u2013 12 nm in diameter corresponding to the amyloid deposits (f). AA amyloidosis was diagnosed from these findings. In addition to the glomeruli, amyloid deposits were mainly observed in the interlobular artery walls and tubulointerstitium (e). Endoscopic biopsy of the stomach, duodenum, and colon revealed AA-positive deposits in the small arteries and tissues of the submucosal layer (a).\nClinical course\nPSL was discontinued, and administration of a soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor inhibitor (etanercept; 25 mg every 2 weeks) was started in May 2008, but it was not effective. By September 2008, Cre was increased to 6.0 mg/dL. She underwent surgery to prepare an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. Etanercept was discontinued, and a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab; 8 mg/kg = 360 mg/month) was started in February 2009. After 3 months, her CRP decreased to 0.0 mg/dL, and the DAS28-CRP sore was 2.12. After 2 years of tocilizumab therapy, urinary protein excretion was decreased to 1.1 g/day, and Cre was 4.0 mg/dL. Subsequently, Cre remained in the range of 4.5 \u2013 5.0 mg/dL until December 2017. While Cre increased to 7.1 mg/dL after initiation of treatment with denosumab (a human monoclonal antibody that binds to receptor activator of NF\u03baB ligand) for osteoporosis in October 2018, it remained at 7.0 mg/dL in June 2019 ().\nGastroduodenal biopsy was performed in May 2013 and May 2017. On both occasions, no amyloid deposits were detected in the submucosal blood vessels (b). What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight.

    "question": "A 67-year-old Japanese woman underwent OWHTO to treat SPONK that had occurred in the left medial femoral condyle (Fig. ). The patient reported the following history of the present illness. Pain in the left knee joint initially occurred at 1 year and 4 months before admission, without any particular trigger. Her former treating physician had provided conservative treatments such as oral administration of anti-inflammatory analgesics, rehabilitation including quadriceps muscle training, and guidance on the use of a cane to relieve weight bearing. However, this treatment was not successful in relieving her symptoms, and she was referred to our department for surgery. The patient had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and she had been taking oral candesartan and atorvastatin. The patient was a housewife with no noteworthy aspects related to social, family, or environmental history. On physical examination, the patient had a height of 157 cm, a body weight of 62 kg, and a body mass index of 25.2 kg/m2. She reported feeling pain in the medial joint space of the knee during walking, as well as during climbing or descending stairs. At the time of the first admission, her systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 165/97 mmHg. Table provides an overview of the patient\u2019s pain scores in the knee joint, ROM of the knee joint, and knee joint function. Neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings. Similarly, laboratory findings at the time of the first admission did not indicate any abnormality: total protein 7.3 g/dl, albumin 4.6 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 22 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 18 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 213 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 297 U/L, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 18 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, Na 142 mEq/L, Cl 104 mEq/L, K 4.5 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 21.4 mg/dl, creatinine 0.56 mg/dl, Ca 9.7 mg/dl, inorganic phosphorus 3.7 mg/dl, leukocytes 5100/\u03bcl, erythrocytes 5.00 \u00d7 106/\u03bcl, hemoglobin 14.4 g/dl, hematocrit 43.6%, and platelets 263 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl.\nThe HAL-SJ treatment program was divided into five phases []. Phase 1 consisted of preoperative observation from the day of hospital admission until the day of surgery. The patient\u2019s thigh circumference and lower leg length were measured preoperatively to adjust the HAL-SJ to the patient\u2019s physical size, which would ensure appropriate training. We palpated the patient\u2019s quadriceps muscles (vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and vastus lateralis) and attached electrodes to each muscle to detect the bioelectric potentials of the long axis along the belly of each muscle. We instructed the patient to perform knee extension and to contract her quadriceps. On the basis of these data, we instructed the patient to simulate the knee extension training, which would be performed postoperatively. Specifically, the patient sat with her lower leg hanging down naturally, and the height of the chair was adjusted so that the patient\u2019s feet were not in contact with the floor. The patient performed ten knee extensions with HAL-SJ assistance, using the muscle that exhibited the largest bioelectric potential amplitude.\nPhase 2 involved surgery (day of surgery). The patient underwent OWHTO (Figs. and ) using TomoFix (DePuy Synthes, Bettlach, Switzerland), artificial bone (OSferion60, \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate; Olympus Terumo Biomaterials, Tokyo, Japan), and biplanar osteotomy, as described by Takeuchi et al. []. The preoperative weight-bearing line (WBL) percentage [], calculated on the basis of an anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph of the affected leg in full knee extension, was 29.6%. The surgery was planned with a target postoperative WBL percentage of 62.5%. The actual enlarged angle and distance of osteotomy were 5.5 degrees and 7 mm, respectively.\nPhase 3 consisted of postoperative observation from day 1 to day 7 postoperatively. For postoperative rehabilitation, partial weight bearing was allowed after a non-weight-bearing period of 2 weeks, and full weight bearing began at 4 weeks postoperatively. The patient received rehabilitation training under the guidance of a physical therapist (ROM exercises and muscle-strengthening training) for 20\u201340 minutes each day, 5 days per week, from the first postoperative day until discharge. For ROM exercises, continuous passive motion training began on the first postoperative day for 1 hour per day and continued every day until discharge. On postoperative day 7, we attached electrodes to the quadriceps muscle to detect the bioelectric potential along the long axis of the rectus femoris muscle belly (Fig. ). Then, the patient was instructed to perform active knee extension exercises that involved contracting her quadriceps, thus simulating training with HAL-SJ (Fig. ).\nPhase 4 consisted of HAL-SJ therapy from postoperative day 8 to discharge. The CVC mode of HAL-SJ serves to support the patient\u2019s voluntary motion on the basis of voluntary muscle activity and the assistive torque provided to the knee joint []. In this study, we used the CVC mode, which allowed the operator to adjust the degree of physical support to maintain the patient\u2019s comfort while gradually reducing support as training progressed. In addition to the regular rehabilitation program (Fig. ), the patient performed HAL-JS-assisted knee extension exercises while sitting, which consisted of five sets of ten repetitions per set, twice per week (Fig. ). The training was performed six times before the patient was discharged (postoperative days 8, 10, 15, 17, 22, and 24). The mean training duration, including the time required to put on the HAL-SJ, was 15.5 \u00b1 1.4 minutes (15 minutes, 16 minutes, 17 minutes, 16 minutes, 13 minutes, and 16 minutes during training sessions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). There were no adverse events related to the use of HAL-SJ, and the patient was discharged 30 days after the surgery.\nPhase 5 consisted of post-HAL-SJ therapy observation from discharge until 3 months after the end of HAL-SJ therapy, during which the following indicators were assessed: EL, assessed as the difference between the maximum knee joint extension angle during passive exercise and that during active exercise; knee pain rated on the visual analogue scale (VAS); isometric knee extension muscle strength (IKEMS); active ROM before surgery, before and after HAL-SJ training, and at 1 and 3 months after the end of training; and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score [] before surgery, at discharge, and at 1 and 3 months after the end of training. Furthermore, we used lateral radiographs to measure the tibial slope angle (TSA) and Insall-Salvati ratio (ISR) as indicators of patellar tendon shortening before surgery and after implant removal at 1 year after the operation [] (Fig. ). Measurement of knee ROM was performed using goniometry, and the landmarks used in the measurements were the greater trochanter of the femur, proximal head of the fibula, and lateral malleolus. Goniometry was used because it has been reported that goniometric measurements of ROM are more reliable than visual observation, with an accuracy of up to 1.0 degree []. The maximal IKEMS of the operated leg was assessed with the patient in a sitting position, with the hips and knees flexed at 90 degrees. A \u03bcTas F-1 handheld dynamometer (Anima Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was fixed to the chair, and two measurements were recorded. Each trial lasted 3\u20135 seconds, with 30 seconds of rest between trials. The higher score of two valid trials was recorded. All measurements were performed by a single trained physical therapist to eliminate interobserver variability. The EL, VAS, IKEMS, and ROM results are shown in Table . The EL improved from 3 degrees preoperatively to 0 degrees at the end of the sixth HAL-SJ training session, but it returned to 3 degrees at 1 and 3 months after the end of the training. When we compared results obtained before training against those obtained after each of the six training sessions, we observed that three sessions produced improved EL and three sessions produced improved or relatively constant VAS scores immediately after training. However, for the other three sessions, the patient reported increased pain immediately after training, with the greatest increase in pain reported immediately after the first HAL-SJ training session, when the VAS score was 1.7 times higher immediately after training than before training. The EL improved after training sessions 1 and 3, when the patient reported increased knee pain (expressed as the VAS score). However, the EL did not change after training sessions 2 and 4, when the patient reported less knee pain (improved VAS score immediately after training). The patient did not refuse to undergo training because of increased pain. The IKEMS value was the largest preoperatively (17.6 kgf) and decreased to its lowest value (30% of the preoperative strength) before the first HAL-SJ intervention at 8 days after the operation. The IKEMS remained relatively constant throughout HAL-SJ training but recovered to the preoperative value during follow-up (18.7 and 16.6 kgf at 1 and 3 months, respectively, after completion of HAL-SJ training). The active ROM also recovered to the preoperative value by the end of the sixth HAL-SJ training session. Thereafter, the extension ROM did not change, but the flexion ROM was maintained or improved. The JOA score decreased from 60 points preoperatively to 55 points at discharge, but it improved with time, reaching 65 and 85 points at 1 and 3 months, respectively, after the end of HAL-SJ training. Whereas the TSA was maintained at 13.1 degrees before and after the surgery, the ISR decreased from 1.13 preoperatively to 0.97 postoperatively. At 6 months after surgery, the passive ROM was 0\u2013135 degrees, and the JOA score was 90 points. There were no complications throughout the preparation, surgery, or rehabilitation process.

    "question": "This is a 61-year-old woman who presented with diabetic symptoms and was misclassified as having type 1 diabetes with negative autoimmune-related type 1 diabetes antibodies (Tyrosine Phosphatase antibodies and Glutamic acid Decarboxylase antibodies). She was referred to our center due to uncontrolled diabetes despite the high doses of insulin and the coexistence of severe insulin resistance and decreased body mass index (BMI: 19.4 kg/m2). Age of presentation was 29 years and for the following 30 years she was treated with multiple daily insulin injections with high insulin requirements (5 IU/kg/day) together with metformin 2 g/day for 30 years, but constantly displaying poor glycemic control. Dyslipidemia was observed at the age of 35 years with raised cholesterol levels and severe hypertriglyceridemia despite intense lipid lowering therapy which lately consisted of the combination of fenofibrate 145 mg, rosuvastatin 40 mg/day and omega-3 fatty acids/day together with restricted fat intake. Hypertension was observed at the age of 5 years, and lately treated with the combination of nifedipine 120 mg/day, eplerenone 25 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day.\nShe also had micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes indicating constantly insufficient glycemic control. She presented peripheral diabetic neuropathy (distal symmetric polyneuropathy) and nephropathy (eGFR: 43 ml/min, albuminuria: 314 mg/24 h). She also suffered from severe cardiovascular disease including peripheral artery disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Peripheral artery disease presented as intermittent claudication and carotid stenosis, for which she had a right carotid endarterectomy at the age of 52 years old. She was managed with clopidogrel 75 mg/day.\nShe had menarche at the age of 11, followed by irregular menstruation and then premature menopause at the age of 38. She also reported polycystic ovarian syndrome and never conceived. She underwent hysterectomy due to fibroids at the age of 54. She was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 58 and has since received alendronate 70 mg/week.\nIt has not been possible to conduct genetic family screening. Her mother and her maternal aunt displayed a lipodystrophy phenotype with fat loss of upper and lower extremities, presented diabetes from the ages of 25 and 28 respectively, and both showed early presentation of cardiovascular disease, presenting as ischemic stroke at the age of 45 years old and myocardial infarction at the same age, respectively. Her mother had reproductive problems and six miscarriages. Two out of four sisters and one brother developed hypertension and dyslipidemia at a young age.\nA genetic analysis for lipodystrophy was performed and included the sequence and deletion/duplication analysis of the following genes: ADRA2A, AGPAT2, AKT2, BSCL2, CAV1, CAVIN1, CIDEC, FBN1, KCNJ6, LIPE, LMNA, LMNB2, PCYT1A, PIK3R1, PLIN1, POLD1, PPARG, PSMB8, and ZMPSTE24. The analysis revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the PPARG gene (c470A>G, p. Glu157Gly, exon3) (The University of Chicago Genetic Services Laboratory). This particular amino acid change has not been described in other patients with PPARG-related disorders, but a different pathogenic sequence change affecting the same amino acid residue (p. Glu157Asp) has been described in a family with PPARG-related lipodystrophy (). In our case the substitution of the negative charged glutamic acid at position 157 by the hydrophobic glycine could possibly lead to the formation of a non-functional protein responsible for the lipodystrophy phenotype. According to missense interpretation by experimental report classifier (MITER) the described mutation is associated with 78.6% probability of causing FPLD3 and 6.5-fold increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nExamination revealed clinical signs of lipodystrophy of upper and lower limbs and gluteal area. Facial fat and abdominal prominence were also noted. She also had phlebectasia, hirsutism and cervical acanthosis nigricans. The patient mentioned that this phenotype was present from the age of 20 years old. Blood pressure was 175/84 mmHg.She was underweighted with a BMI: 19.40 kg/m2 (weight: 46 kg, height: 154 cm) ().\nTo assess the degree of regional fat loss in this case, we compared the total and proportional fat content in defined body regions using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with a group of healthy, lean postmenopausal women (). The case has a relatively short stature and as a consequence a total lean mass not far from the lower end the 95% confidence interval of the comparators. The total fat mass was drastically lower giving a first indication of a lipodystrophic state. The visceral fat mass was similar to the comparators whilst the proportional fat content in extremities was drastically reduced showing the classic features of peripheral fat loss in partial lipodystrophy ().\nAt the time of the first evaluation biochemical measurements revealed glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 10%, a total cholesterol of 132 mg/dl of which high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) was 25 mg/dl. There was severe hypertriglyceridemia at 2.919 mg/dl. Further tests confirmed chronic kidney disease (blood urea nitrogen: 49.6 mg/dl, creatinine: 1.3 mg/dl, eGFR: 43 ml/min) and albuminuria (314 mg/24 h).\nWe performed glucagon stimulation test which revealed residual insulin secretion (fasting C-peptide: 2.09 ng/ml, 6 min after 1 mg of glucagon infusion C-peptide: 3.13 ng/ml). Plasma leptin concentration was close to zero (0.43 ng/ml).\nAbdominal ultrasound confirmed hepatic steatosis and transient elastography (fibroscan) detected liver stiffness of 18 Kpa. Abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was unremarkable apart from hepatomegaly with a liver percentage fat fraction of 9.4%, and an enlarged spleen (). Cardiac MRI revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (maximal wall thickness 17 mm) and myocardial fibrosis in the basal interventricular septum (LGE SCORE 1/48, LGE mass 2%). Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal mitral regurgitation, and ejection fraction of 60% ().\nAfter noting her poor glycemic control, her antidiabetic treatment was intensified with empagliflozin 10 mg/daily and liraglutide 1.8 mg/daily, but this resulted only in a slight improvement in glycemic control after 3 months (HbA1c: 9.3%), despite additional strict dietetic management, but without any change in insulin management. We did not observe any change in triglyceride (TG) levels.\nMetreleptin was then initiated at 5 mg once daily on top of the current lipid and diabetes management. Glycemic control and hypertriglyceridemia improved within two months of treatment evidenced by decrease of HbA1C from 10 to 8.7% and the reduction of TG from a baseline value of 2.919 to 242 mg/dl. At six months there was further reduction in HbA1C (7.9%) and in TG (198 mg/dl). This improvement was sustained one year after treatment with metreleptin in the same dose (HbA1C: 8%, TG: 185 mg/dl-standard serum determinations are listed in ), (). Insulin doses were reduced from more than 5 to 2.22 IU/kg/day. Blood pressure was also better controlled without any change in anti-hypertensive medication.\nAt six months of metreleptin treatment a reduced liver fat content was observed (MRI estimated liver percentage fat fraction was reduced from 9.4 to 6.8%). However, liver stiffness assessed by transient elastography remained stable. A repeated DXA scan showed unchanged total fat mass content and cardiac MRI revealed no change (). Reduction in appetite following metreleptin treatment was reported. Hunger scales for the assessment of appetite were not used. Metreleptin treatment was well tolerated with no other adverse effects. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "A 53-year old man (height, 175 cm; weight, 87 kg) was scheduled to undergo subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein reconstruction for pancreatic cancer after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Laparoscopic left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma was performed 1 year prior; therefore, harvesting the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction was planned because the left renal vein was too short. Preoperative serum creatinine level and potassium level were 1.39 mg/dL and 4.1 mEq/L, respectively.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced rapidly with propofol, rocuronium, fentanyl, and remifentanil and maintained with desflurane. The patient\u2019s vital signs remained stable while resection of the distal stomach, gallbladder, distal common bile duct, and pancreatic head was performed. Bleeding from the first jejunal vein (J1V) occurred during adhesion detachment around the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and clamping of the J1V was required to control the bleeding. Immediately after J1V clamping, bowel congestion progressed because the patient\u2019s intestinal blood flow had been bypassed from the SMV to the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein through J1V due to complete obstruction of the portal vein by the tumor. Therefore, a heparin-coated bypass tube (ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube, TORAY MEDICAL Co., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted from the SMV to the right great saphenous vein to relieve the bowel congestion. Several minutes after insertion of the ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube, blood potassium level rose from 4.7 mEq/L to 6.0 mEq/L, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia occurred. Chest compression was promptly performed by surgeons, and anesthesiologists attempted direct current defibrillation several times; epinephrine, magnesium sulphate, bicarbonate, lidocaine, and amiodarone were also administered. In addition to resuscitation, anesthesiologists inserted a blood-access catheter to the right internal jugular vein and started continuous renal replacement therapy to prevent elevation of blood potassium level. Spontaneous circulation was recovered after 30 min. The surgical team decided to discontinue the surgery, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after packing gauze into the abdomen and with the ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube left inserted. Total blood loss was 5620 mL, and total fluid balance was + 6115 mL. The operation time was 10 h 30 min.\nTwo days after the first operation, the patient was scheduled to undergo tumor resection and portal vein reconstruction with REIV. The surgical team abandoned using the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction because of concerns that brain congestion after harvesting the jugular vein could affect brain function recovery. Anesthesia was maintained with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, rocuronium, and remifentanil. Continuous hemodiafiltration had been performed in the ICU due to persistent anuria and continued during the operation to prevent hyperkalemia. Both legs were compressed with a pneumatic compression device throughout the operation to prevent deep venous thrombosis formation. A section of the REIV 5 cm in length was harvested intraperitoneally with a surgical stapler, and the REIV distal end was closed with a 4-0 polypropylene running suture. The inferior epigastric vein, pubic branch of the obturator vein, and the deep circumflex iliac vein were preserved. A surgical nurse noticed swelling of the patient\u2019s right leg 2 h after harvesting; the surgical team ensured careful observation throughout the surgery because a transient change by congestion of the right leg was suspected. Blood potassium level was slightly elevated after REIV resection, but ventricular arrhythmia was absent. Surgery was completed as scheduled (operation time, 7 h 3 min), and the patient was transferred to the ICU again. Total blood loss and total fluid balance were 2485 mL and + 2587 mL, respectively.\nOn ICU admission, distention and fullness of the right leg worsened. An orthopedist diagnosed the patient with acute compartment syndrome, and right leg elevation to lower the intracompartmental pressure was initiated. Blood potassium level was rapidly elevated immediately after leg elevation (Fig. ), which caused sustained ventricular tachycardia despite efforts to lower blood potassium level such as the administration of bicarbonate, glucose-insulin, and continuous hemodialysis with potassium-free dialysate. Chest compressions were initiated immediately. Ventricular tachycardia was prolonged; therefore, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) was induced, and spontaneous circulation was recovered after resolution of hyperkalemia (Fig. , Table ). Emergent fasciotomy was performed by orthopedists 1 h after induction of V-A ECMO because the intracompartmental tissue pressure of the anterior compartment was 70 mmHg.\nV-A ECMO was withdrawn 2 days later, and the patient was extubated 10 days after portal vein reconstruction. He had no apparent neural deficits; however, paralysis and paresthesia of the right leg persisted after discharge from the ICU 17 days post-operatively.

Past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, seizure disorder and schizoaffective disorder. She also had a long-term history of alcoholism, consuming two to three pints of vodka every day for about 20 years. Her last drink of alcohol was about 48 hours prior to presentation. On examination, her weight was 79 kg, height 65 inches, body mass index 29.3 kg/m2. Vital signs were stable, temp 98.6\u00b0F, heart rate 68 bpm, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 113/71 mmHg and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. She was alert and oriented, there was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. Cardiac examination revealed a regular sinus rhythm with no murmurs. There were no deformities or edema of the extremities and distal pulses were present. There was no cushingoid facies, buffalo hump or abdominal striae noted. Neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness of 4/5, with intact sensory system and reflexes. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable.\nBiochemical analysis of the serum showed severe electrolyte disturbances, a potassium level of 2.3 mmol/L (reference 3.6\u22125.1 mmol/L), magnesium level of 0.9 mg/dL (reference 1.8\u22123.0 mg/dL), phosphorus level of 2.0 mg/dL (reference 2.4\u22124.6 mg/dL), corrected calcium level of 7.8 mg/dL (reference 8.9\u221210.3 mg/dL). Renal function was mildly deranged with Creatinine of 1.35 mg/dL (reference 0.4\u22121.3 mg/dL) and BUN of 12 mg/dL (reference 8\u221220mg/dL). The results of hepatic enzymes, AST 113 IU/l (reference 15\u221241 IU/l), ALT 42 IU/l (reference 17\u221263 IU/l) was suggestive of alcohol induced hepatic damage. Electrocardiogram (ECG) () showed no arrhythmias, but changes characteristic of hypokalemia with increased amplitude of the U-wave and marked corrected QT segment prolongation (QTc 551 ms). Patient was admitted to intensive care unit for severe hypokalemia management and cardiac monitoring. Aggressive supplementation of electrolytes was initiated (), however despite supplementation with enteral and parenteral potassium as well as magnesium and phosphate, potassium level failed to increase () and subsequently she had a sinus bradycardia followed by asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated when asystole was noted, return of spontaneous circulation was obtained after 8 minutes of resuscitation. Patient was mechanically ventilated for two days and her own efficient respiration was reestablished, then she was successfully extubated. During the following days, the patient was conscious, alert and oriented to time, place and person. Further laboratory testing revealed thyroid- stimulating hormone level was 1.100 mIU/L (reference 0.45\u22124.50 mIU/L). Active renin level was 0.653ng/ml/hr (reference 0.167\u22125.38 ng/ml/hr), aldosterone levels was <0.01 ng/dL (reference 0.00\u2212 30 ng/dL). Creatine kinase (CK) level was 6922 U/L (reference 38\u2013297 IU/L), indicating rhabdomyolysis. The arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH of 7.430, partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 29 mmHg; partial pressure of oxygen was 74 mmHg; HCO3 was 25 mmol/L and base excess of -4.7 mmol/L. Urinalysis showed dilute urine of 1.010 g/mL specific gravity (reference 1.005 to 1.030), Urine pH of 6.5, and no proteinuria. Urine electrolytes were measured on spot urine analysis and twenty-four-hour urine collection, result depicted in . Serial electrocardiogram monitoring showed resolution of ECG changes (). Follow up laboratory tests revealed normalization of electrolytes level (). Post cardiac arrest serial ECGs didn\u2019t reveal any ischemic changes, cardiac enzymes were not elevated and echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function, Ejection Fraction of 60\u201365%. Cardiac arrest was presumed to be secondary to severe hypokalemia and there was no necessity for further cardiac evaluation. She was then discharged from the hospital with recommendations for abstinence from alcohol. Follow up outpatient appointment with primary care physician was provided.

    "question": "A 43-years-old Caucasian male (height 198 cm, weight 115 kg, tobacco smoker \u2013 1 packet of cigarettes/day) was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital from a municipal hospital because of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome associated with infection and necrosis of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia of the left lower leg. The signs and symptoms of the disease \u2013 edema and pain affecting the left leg-began 7 days before admission. The patient's medical history was significant for hepatitis C (HCV), treated with ribavarin and interferon, and diabetes mellitus treated with insulin. On the day of admission the HCV-RNA test was negative. A mosquito bite was the probable triggering event.\nOn admission to the ICU the patient was confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9. He was afebrile, had tachycardia, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, hypotension, with a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, and relative respiratory insufficiency (oxygen saturation of 88% \u2013 90%). He had moderately-dilated pupils with a delayed light reflex. We noted crepitus over the bilateral lung fields, a tender abdomen with absent bowel sounds, and oliguria. There were numerous hemorrhagic extravasations on the skin. Examination of the left leg revealed diffuse edema of the skin, with marked erythema and necrosis; margins of infection were sharply demarcated, spreading onto the buttock and perineum on the left side (Figure ). Laboratory tests showed a metabolic acidosis, with the following values: base excess -15 mmol/l, lactate level 7.3 mmol/l, PaO2 64 mmHg, platelet count 29,000/mm3, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.24, serum creatinine 691.6 \u03bcmol/l, bilirubin 62.6 \u03bcmol/l, and C-reactive Protein (CRP) 224.6 \u03bcg/dl.\nThe Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on the day of admission was 31 points and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 18 points. The patient required fluid resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation in BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) mode, continuous intravenous infusion of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) and low doses of steroids to restore blood pressure. After obtaining cultures from the affected tissue, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in appropriate media, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotics were immediately administered (meropenem 3 g/day in a 3-h infusion, vancomycin 3 g/day in continuous infusion, metronidazole 1.5/day in 3 divided doses). Because of progressive organ dysfunction, therapy was started with activated protein C, in doses of 24 \u03bcg/kg/h; continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was also started. After several hours, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 140 beats per minute and his blood pressure decreased to 80/50 mmHg. Electrical cardioversion was performed three times, followed by continuous infusion of cordarone (12 mg/kg/day). During this time, intensive fluid resuscitation was administered. During the first day, the patient received 12,800 ml of fluid (colloids and crystalloids). His unstable condition did not allow for early surgical management.\nThe cultures from the affected areas of skin contained Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus sciuri. Based on sensitivity results, vancomycin and metronidazole were discontinued, and penicillin G was started at a dose of 60 million units a day (intravenous) in 6 divided doses. Because the patient's poor condition persisted and the microbes were sensitive to clindamycin, it was added at 2.7 g/day in 3 divided doses. In spite of the lack of information about G-pathogens, meropenem was continued. The patient also received 40 g of commercially available gamma-globulin (intravenous), 8 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 8 units of platelets. After several days his condition improved, with urine output of 100\u2013150 ml/h and resolution of his metabolic acidosis. On the sixth day, the patient's hemodynamic parameters deteriorated again, with tachycardia to 160 beats per minute and a decrease in blood pressure to 85/60 mmHg. CVVH was administered again for detoxification. On the seventh day, the necrotic tissue was surgically excised (Figures , ). We also noted a progressive decline in the white blood cell count to 2,200/mm3, and administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor.\nCultures of the BAL showed 104 colony-forming units/ml of methycillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). (The patient had been a carrier of methycillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] isolated from his nose vestibule on admission.) Because MRSA also was present in blood cultures and the patient's condition remained poor, linezolid 1.2 g a day in 2 divided doses was initiated based on additional results of susceptibility tests. After 10 days of intensive treatment, the patient was hemodynamically stable, and we discontinued mechanical ventilation. 25 days after admission the patient was discharged to the trauma surgery ward for plastic reconstruction of his wounds. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "A 65-year-old female consulted our office for naturopathic primary-care support for a myriad of conditions, which included diabetes with weight gain, chronic fatigue, depression with emotional lability, frequent colds, and recurrent urinary tract infections. The latter was attributed to a medullary sponge kidney as was her history of kidney stones and hypertension. The patient also suffered with long-standing acid reflux and was prone to irritable bowel with diarrhea. She had also suffered with multiple abscesses in the past as well as poor generalized wound healing. A history of fibroadenomas was also noted. The patient recollected, \u201cnever being well\u201d, even as a child. She described her diet as a child as \u201cdeficient\u201d and consisted mostly of canned beans and bread, which she attributed to her poor socioeconomic status as a child.\nPharmacological management of her diabetic condition included the use of metformin/sitagliptin (1,000 mg/50 mg, taken twice per day) and gliclazide (30 mg), also taken twice per day.\nAdditional medications included ramipril (5 mg/day), ranitidine (150 mg, twice per day), low-dose aspirin (81 mg/ day), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day), allopurinol (100 mg/ day), citalopram (40 mg/day), and mirabegron (50 mg/day).\nPhysical examination revealed a 1.69 m (66.5 inch), 88.5 kg (195.0 lb) female. Body mass index was calculated at 31.0 (Obese Class I) (32). Central waist measurement was 112 cm, while her hips measured 118 cm. Blood pressure was 114/64 mmHg, measured at the left brachial artery. Bioimpedance analysis revealed a lean body mass of 49.9 kg (111.0 lbs) and a fat mass of 38.0 kg (84.0 lbs).\nLaboratory assessment prior to date of initial consult (June 2017) revealed a HBA1C of 7.8% and a random glucose of 6.5 mmol/L.

    "question": "An 18-year-old adolescent female was evaluated at 15 weeks\u2019 gestation for history of persistent emesis for four weeks, extreme fatigue and red colored urine for one day. There was no history of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or urinary tract infection.\nPast medical history was unremarkable for diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other autoimmune diseases. She was not known to have hyperthyroidism in the past. Pregnancy had been uneventful except for persistent episodes of emesis for past one month. There was no prior history of mood symptoms or altered mental status. There was no history of heat intolerance, diarrhea, or weight loss. There was no recent history of usage of corticosteroid, loop or thiazide diuretic, strenuous exercise, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge of grape-like vesicles, seizures, alcohol intake, and carbohydrate load. Family history was notable only for type 2 diabetes in the father. There was no known family history of autoimmune diseases, thyroid disorders, hypokalemia, and periodic paralysis. There was no consanguinity.\nVital signs upon presentation showed blood pressure (BP) 142/87 mm Hg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oral temperature 38.9 \u00b0C (102.02 \u00b0F), respiratory rate 18 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her height was 172.7 cm and weight was 109 kg (240 lb 4.8 oz). Physical examination was remarkable for an overweight female who was awake but slow to respond. There was no goiter and ophthalmopathy. There was mild scleral icterus. There was no tremor or pretibial edema.\nSerum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was 246,000 mIU/mL and sonogram confirmed the presence of a single viable intrauterine fetus of approximately 15 weeks gestation with expected uterine size. Renal function test showed sodium 127 mmol/L, potassium 2.5 mmol/L, bicarbonate 33 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 123 mg/dL, serum creatinine 4.2 mg/dL (MDRD estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 17 mL/min/1.73 m2), calcium 9.5 mg/dL, phosphorus 2.7 mg/dL and magnesium of 1 mg/dL. Liver function test showed aspartate aminotransferase 140 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 203 IU/L, total bilirubin 2.9 mg/dL, ammonia 55 \u00b5mol/L, and serum albumin 3.1 gm/dl. Renal function test two months prior to pregnancy showed normal serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL (MDRD eGFR 113 mL/min/1.73 m2) and normal electrolytes (serum sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.9 mg/dL, and magnesium was not available) Serum creatine kinase was normal at 121 U/L (normal 0\u2013180 U/L). Urine sodium was <10 mmol/L, urine creatinine 84 mg/dL, urine potassium 28 mmol/L and urine osmolality was 344 mOsm/kg. Fractional excretion of sodium was 0.4%. Urinalysis showed 1+ proteinuria, no microscopic hematuria, 5 white cells per high power field, no ketonuria, pH 5, specific gravity of 1.015, and negative nitrites and leukocytes. Plasma renin activity was 14 ng/mL/h (normal 0.5\u20134 ng/mL/h, upright) and serum aldosterone was 13 ng/dL (normal 4\u201331 ng/dL, upright). Blood and urine cultures were negative. Other extensive investigations for infectious etiologies were also negative. Urine for Chlamydia and Neisseria was negative. SARS-CoV-2 DNA PCR from the nasopharyngeal swab was negative. Other labs were notable for undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level < 0.030 mIU/L (reference 0.4\u20135 mIU/L), total T3 238 ng/dL (reference 87\u2013178 ng/dL), and free T4 > 6.99 ng/dL (reference 0.6\u20131.2 ng/dL). Computed tomography of the head showed no acute intracranial abnormalities.\nInitial management included administration of intravenous fluids (IVF), propranolol, potassium iodide, propylthiouracil (PTU), and hydrocortisone. A presumptive diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum with thyroid storm and AKI secondary to persistent emesis was made. She met criteria for thyroid storm due to elevated serum free T4 and total T3 with undetected TSH, along with pyrexia, tachycardia, icterus, and altered mental status. Her clinical condition improved somewhat after receiving PTU, propranolol, and hydrocortisone as heart rate, blood pressure, and free T4 began to decrease. Her mental status improved and she became more alert and engaged in conversation. Given tachycardia and hypertension, she was started on propranolol 60 mg every 4 hours which was later converted to 160 mg daily.\nOther thyroid studies showed thyroid peroxidase antibody 0.3 IU/mL (reference < 9 IU/mL), TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) < 0.90 (reference < 1.75 IU/L), and undetected thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) of < 0.10 (reference \u2264 0.54 IU/L). Given negative TRAb, Graves\u2019 disease was highly unlikely. Serum free T4 normalized in ten days, TSH in two weeks and total T3 in five days. Given pregnancy, further modalities including radioactive iodine uptake study were not pursued, given risk of fetal hypothyroidism, mental retardation, and increased risk of malignancy. Partial molar pregnancy was initially considered due to presentation of thyroid storm, however, the beta-hCG level was trending down and the patient did not show any signs of pre-eclampsia. Thyroid sonogram showed normal sized thyroid with homogenous thyroid texture and without increased vascularity, making Grave\u2019s disease unlikely. Investigations for AKI included renal sonogram which showed right kidney measuring 12.8 cm in length and left kidney measuring 12.6 cm in length with bilateral normal cortical echogenicity without evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrocalcinosis. Hepatic sonogram showed gallbladder sludge. A chest X-ray was normal without pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly. Electrocardiogram showed normal Q-T interval. Echocardiogram was normal with ejection fraction of 65%. Cardiac enzymes were normal.\nPTU was later changed to methimazole as she was no longer in the first trimester of pregnancy and as she demonstrated signs of liver insufficiency. Anti-emetics and IVF were discontinued after few days as the patient was able to tolerate well by mouth. Hydrocortisone was discontinued after two days. Subsequently, propranolol was discontinued along with methimazole, as the beta-hCG mediated hyperemesis was thought to be the likely etiology of thyroid symptoms. Her vital signs, including BPs, remained stable and her thyroid levels returned to normal without anti-thyroid drugs. Serum beta-hCG at discharge was 175,557 mIU/mL. Given decreasing level of hCG without other signs or symptoms of gestational trophoblastic disease, molar pregnancy was unlikely. She was discharged without any thyroid medications.\nDuring the hospitalization, her serum potassium remained around 2.4\u20132.9 meq/L along with serum bicarbonate 30\u201338 meq/L despite resolution of emesis. Serum magnesium remained low, as well as with values ranging from 1\u20131.4 mg/dL. Twenty-four hour urine collection showed a urine calcium of 0.04 mg/kg/day. Random urine calcium to creatinine ratio was also low at 0.005. She required multiple intravenous potassium and magnesium supplements. Discharge serum potassium and magnesium was 3.5 meq/L and 1.2 mg/dL, respectively. She was discharged on magnesium oxide 400 mg daily and potassium chloride 10 meq twice daily. BUN and serum creatinine slowly improved with intravenous hydration. Kidney biopsy was not performed and renal replacement therapy was not required. Discharge BUN and serum creatinine was 15 mg/dL and 0.97 mg/dL (MDRD eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), respectively. Due to the persistent hypokalemia, alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria despite resolution of emesis, a genetic testing by next generation sequence analysis was done which showed that the patient was homozygous in the SLCA123 (NM_001126108.2) gene for a known sequence variant designated c.2581C>T (p.Arg861Cys) (Prevention Genetics, Marshfield, WI, USA). No further in vitro functional studies were performed, hence the exact functional implication of this variant was unknown. However, to determine the pathogenicity of this variant, in silico tests were performed using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, FATHMM and MutationTaster. The resulting prediction utilizing these in silico tools was \u201cPathogenic\u201d. At 37 weeks gestation, a healthy infant of 3.5 kilograms was born vaginally without any perinatal complications. The serum creatinine remained stable at 0.7 mg/dL after delivery (MDRD eGFR 132 mL/min/1.73 m2). What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "The patient is a 78-year-old male patient with renal disease from 9 years ago (March 2005). He has lived in Semnan, Iran. His medical records were reviewed in October 2014. Laboratory findings in the patient at first were as follows: BUN = 22, Cr = 1.3, weight: 60 kg, height: 166 cm, blood pressure 145/95 mmHg. The patient was treated. The BUN and creatinine levels gradually increased and reached to BUN = 43 and Cr = 4 thirty months after the first referral. All laboratory tests were performed in a medical diagnostic laboratory using the calibrated equipment and common methods. The BUN and creatinine levels were measured by auto analyzer TC-6062 manufactured by Tecom Co, China. Blood pressure was measured by the Riester sphygmomanometer (Germany). At that time he had referred for arteriovenous graft and an arteriovenous fistula made by a surgeon. Six months later he had a functional fistula. Patients were treated with the conventional treatment and Eprex. Specific variables in this case were creatinine and GFR. Blood pressure controlled in the range of 110/80 mmHg. The patient's GFR decreased from 20 to 14 cc/min and his last blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg. The mean serum creatinine level was 3, maximum 4.2 and minimum 1.5.

    "question": "A 23-year-old man presented to hospital with a 2-week history of oedema, frothy urine and lower abdominal pain. This is on a background of ulcerative colitis (UC) for which he was on sulfasalazine. He denied any other regular medications, over the counter medications or herbal supplements. His family history included his mother having IgA nephropathy. He was an occasional smoker and rarely consumed alcohol. He denied illicit drug use. On examination, he was mildly tachycardic (105 beats per minute) and normotensive. He was 180 cm tall and weighed 93 kg. He had mild bilateral pitting oedema to his knees. The rest of his examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed normal renal function with a creatinine of 75 \u03bcmol/L, hypoalbuminaemia with a serum albumin of 15 g/l and urinalysis revealing 3+ protein. His urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) was 944.9 mg/mmol. His total cholesterol was 8.3 mmol/L. GN, vasculitis, infection and myeloma screen (dsDNA, C3 & C4, anti-PLA-2R, hepatitis B & C serology, serum free light chains and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation) were negative, with the exception of a positive atypical perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Importantly the myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3) titres were both < 1 IU/ml. ANCA positivity is most likely explained by our patient\u2019s history of UC where ANCA positivity is reported in 60\u201380% of patients, with a predominant p-ANCA pattern [].\nDuring preparation for renal biopsy our patient was found to have a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 47 s. This corrected on a mixing study. Factor 12 deficiency (29%) was subsequently identified. Haematology opinion was that this conferred no increase in in vivo bleeding risk.\nRenal biopsy was undertaken with LM revealing no morphological abnormality (see Fig. ). IF revealed nonspecific trace glomerular deposits of IgM and C3. MCD was the most likely diagnosis. Our patient was consequently commenced on 75 mg oral prednisone daily.\nAfter 1 month our patient achieved complete remission. He was no longer oedematous, his serum albumin was 33 g/l (from 15 g/L) and uACR was 0.7 mg/mmol (from 944.9 mg/mmol). His prednisone was slowly weaned from 75 mg daily to 50 mg daily for a fortnight and then 25 mg daily for a fortnight. Our patient remained in remission with a serum albumin of 39 g/L, total cholesterol of 6 mmol/L and no albuminuria.\nThe electron microscopy (EM) report from our patient\u2019s renal biopsy returned 2 months later. This revealed patchy foot process effacement, and mesangial expansion with some deposits suggestive of a mesangiopathic process (see Fig. ).\nOur patient then suffered a dramatic relapse with the prednisone dose at 20 mg/day. He reported recurrence of frothy urine, 4 kg of weight gain and proteinuria (on urine dipstick given for home monitoring). His prednisone was increased to 25 mg daily but despite this his oedema worsened and proteinuria persisted. Therefore his prednisone dose was further increased to 75 mg daily to induce remission (see Fig. ).\nA complete clinical remission was achieved over the next 2 months with serum albumin improving to 38 g/L and total cholesterol to 6.3 mmol/L. At this stage he was commenced on oral cyclosporin 100 mg BD as a steroid sparing agent given the previous failed attempt to wean steroids. Over the next 5 months our patient\u2019s prednisone dosage was weaned more slowly. At a dose of 10 mg prednisone daily he suffered a second relapse with recurrence of oedema in association with albuminuria and hypoalbuminaemia to his previous levels. His prednisone dose was increased back to 50 mg daily and then 75 mg daily to re-induce remission.\nGiven his multiple relapses, steroid dependence and initial EM report suggestive of a mesangiopathic process, our patient underwent a second renal biopsy. LM was again normal, however IF found significant mesangial deposits of IgM (2\u20133+) and C3 (2\u20133+) (see Figs. and ). IgM nephropathy was then consider a possible diagnosis.\nThis time our patient took longer to achieve remission, requiring 75 mg prednisone daily and an increase in his cyclosporin dose to 125 mg BD. His prednisone dose was again weaned to 25 mg daily. He also self-ceased his cyclosporin. Our patient was adherent to the recommended prednisone dose as he recognised that without it he would relapse, and he felt further relapses would impact his career progression.\nAfter more than 12 months on prednisone 25 mg daily, and a total of 2 years on continuous corticosteroids, our patient agreed to a slow wean of the corticosteroid dose. Our plan was to use anti-human CD20 (Rituximab) if severe nephrosis recurred. He once again relapsed as soon as his prednisone dose reached 20 mg daily. At this stage his prednisone was increased to 50 mg daily, and he received the first of two planned doses of Rituximab 1 g as an outpatient. He suffered no adverse reactions from the rituximab. During this relapse, his serum albumin reached 10 g/L, 24 h urinary protein was 14.76 g/day and his total cholesterol was 11.5 mmol/L (see Fig. ).\nSeveral days after the rituximab infusion, our patient presented to the Emergency Department with a severe headache, nausea and vomiting. His headache had been progressively worsening since the day prior to his rituximab infusion. There were no focal neurological signs on examination. Computed tomography brain (CTB) and computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed a right transverse sinus thrombosis and non-occlusive posterior sagittal sinus thrombosis. We found no evidence of any inherited or acquired thrombophilia with extensive testing (anti-thrombin 3, factor V Leiden, lupus anticoagulant, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C & S, JAK 2 mutation analysis and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria assay). He was commenced on therapeutic enoxaparin and bridged to warfarin.\nHe went on to receive a second dose of rituximab 1-month later. Since then he has remained in complete remission (see Fig. ). His prednisone was weaned over the following 6 months, and his prednisone was ceased. A repeat CTB and CTA showed resolution of the transverse sinus and posterior sagittal sinus thromboses and a decision was made to stop anti-coagulation. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "An 11-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with microscopic hematuria and nephrotic-range proteinuria detected by school urinary screening. The patient did not have any characteristic features of Fabry\u2019s disease such as angiokeratoma or neuralgia. On admission, her physical examination was unremarkable (body weight 47.4 kg, body height 157.3 cm), and her blood pressure normal (106/60 mmHg). Laboratory investigations revealed hypoproteinemia (serum total protein 5.6 g/dL, serum albumin 2.9 g/dL, serum IgG 318 mg/dL). All other biochemical investigations were within normal limits: blood urea nitrogen 8 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.43 mg/dL, IgA 111 mg/dL, C3 140 mg/dL (normal 84 \u2013 151 mg/dL), C4 26 mg/dL (normal 17 \u2013 40 mg/dL). Anti-hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C antibody, and anti-nuclear antibody were negative. Urinalysis findings were 3+ for occult blood and 3+ for the dipstick protein reaction; her 24-hour urine protein excretion was 2.5 g. Light microscopy analysis of the initial renal biopsy specimen revealed diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with fibrocellular crescents in 4 of 13 glomeruli (a). Immunofluorescence revealed granular deposits of IgA (3+) and C3 (1+) in the mesangial areas (b), and electron microscopy revealed paramesangial electron-dense deposits. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of severe IgA nephropathy was made. The patient was treated intravenously with three courses of methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg/day) pulse therapy (MPT), followed by 2 years of alternate-day prednisolone (initially 1 mg/kg and then tapered gradually) combined with an angiotensin receptor blocker (telmisartan 1 mg/kg/day). In addition, a tonsillectomy was performed 3 months after MPT. However, microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria persisted.\nAt the age of 13 years, the patient was re-admitted for a second renal biopsy to assess the therapeutic effect. All laboratory investigations were within normal limits: serum total protein 6.3 g/dL, serum albumin 4.0 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 12 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.44 mg/dL, IgA 108 mg/dL, C3 96 mg/dL, C4 26 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed a 2+ value for occult blood and a dipstick protein reaction of 2+; the 24-hour urine protein excretion was 0.5 g. Light microscopy analysis of the second renal biopsy specimen revealed focal segmental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. Immunofluorescence revealed granular deposits of IgA (2+) and C3 (1+) in the mesangial areas, and electron microscopy revealed paramesangial electron-dense deposits. After the second renal biopsy, the patient was additionally treated with three courses of MPT, and her microscopic hematuria disappeared within 6 months.\nAt the age of 15 years, she was admitted for a third renal biopsy. On admission, her physical examination was unremarkable (body weight 55.9 kg, body height 165 cm), and her blood pressure normal (102/70 mmHg). Laboratory investigations were all within normal limits: serum total protein 6.6 g/dL, serum albumin 4.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.48 mg/dL, IgA 135 mg/dL, C3 121 mg/dL, C4 25 mg/dL. Urinalysis was negative for occult blood and the dipstick protein reaction was 2+; her 24-hour urine protein excretion was 0.7 g. Light microscopy analysis of the third renal biopsy specimen revealed minor glomerular abnormalities (a). Immunofluorescence revealed granular deposits of IgA (2+) in the mesangial areas, and electron microscopy revealed paramesangial electron-dense deposits. In addition, numerous myelin-like bodies were first observed in podocytes (b). Low serum \u03b1-galactosidase A activity (13.8 Agal U, cut-off value < 20) and increased GL3 excretion in the urine (0.54 mg/mgCr, control 0.1 \u2013 0.4) were also observed. On the basis of these findings, a final diagnosis of concomitant IgA nephropathy (healing stage) and subclinical Fabry\u2019s disease was made.

    "question": "A 27-year-old female presented to the Gout Clinic of Peking Union Medical College Hospital with recurrent arthritis and infertility. Fourteen years before presentation, she noticed protrusion of her right ankle but did not undergo evaluation at a hospital. Eight years before presentation, at age 19, she experienced acute pain and swelling of her right ankle. The pain resolved spontaneously but recurred 6 to 7 times/year, involving the bilateral metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, bilateral ankles, and right knee. Her serum urate level (SUA) was elevated to 789 \u03bcmol/L. A diagnosis of gout was made, and she was prescribed NSAIDs for pain relief and allopurinol and benzbromarone to lower her urate level. However, she discontinued allopurinol and benzbromarone on her own as these medications triggered acute flares. Five years before presentation, she noticed multiple nodules in her MTP joints, ankles, and fingers. The nodules on her feet interfered with normal walking. She also complained of the inability to conceive after 3 years of attempts. Her age at menarche was 14 years, and her cycles were irregular. She was reported to prefer snacks and fatty food during her childhood. Her father had hypertension. Her grandfather had an SUA level greater than 400 \u03bcmol/L but without gout. On physical examination, the patient was generally healthy, with a height of 168 cm and a weight of 55 kg. Her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal. On abdominal palpation, the liver was enlarged with a normal soft texture. A joint examination revealed multiple nodules on the bilateral MTP1 joints, ankles, and fingers.\nA serological examination after overnight fasting revealed a SUA level of 548 \u03bcmol/L, serum creatinine (Cr) level of 49 \u03bcmol/L, fasting glucose level of 3.6 mmol/L, total triglyceride level of 6.22 mmol/L, and total cholesterol level of 6.60 mmol/L. Her resting lactate level was 7.4 mmol/L. Her 24-h urine urate level was 2.262 mmol/24 h, and her fractional excretion of uric acid (FE-UA) was 2.48 %. Her liver enzymes were normal. The estrogen level and basal body temperature curve were normal for her age and menstrual status. Renal ultrasonography revealed normal kidney size with possible calcium deposits in the bilateral renal medulla. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of her abdomen showed hepatomegaly without nodules. The pelvic ultrasonography and salpingography findings were normal. Serum examinations of her parents and her husband were normal.\nWhole blood DNA was extracted from all four family members (the patient, both parents, and her husband) after signing an informed consent form. A genetic study was first conducted with a target gene sequencing approach. A search of the OMIM, NIH, and PubMed databases using the key words \u201cFEMALE,\u201d \u201cGOUT,\u201d and \u201cHYPERLACTACIDEMIA\u201d indicated familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy, glycogen storage disease type I, and glycogen storage disease type II. Next-generation sequencing was used to sequence each of the exons of the UMOD, RENIN, G6PC, SLC37A4, and GAA genes, as well as two SNP loci (rs2231142 and rs72552713) of ABCG2 found in our previous report of a family including a female with gout.\nThe genetic sequencing results showed that UMOD, RENIN, SLC37A4, GAA and rs72552713 of ABCG2 were all normal in the patient and her family. Sequencing of the G6PC gene revealed composite heterozygous c.190G>T/c.508C>T mutations in the patient, a heterozygous c.190G>T mutation in her father, and a heterozygous c.508C>T mutation in her mother. The genetic analysis of her husband was normal. The c.190G>T mutation was located on exon 1 and encoded a missense mutation of p.V64L, whereas the c.508C>T mutation was located on exon 4 and encoded a nonsense mutation of p.R170X (Fig. ). Sequencing of 50 healthy females and 100 healthy males at the two loci produced normal results. To our knowledge, the c.190G>T mutation has not been reported in previous literature.

    "question": "A 31-year-old black Congolese female patient, P3G3, who had a pregnancy of 38 weeks and four days, was transferred from a district hospital to a tertiary facility in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, for severe preeclampsia with acute on chronic fetal distress. Her past medical history was notable for eclampsia during her first pregnancy in 2011 and preeclampsia in 2013 during her second pregnancy. She had had two cesarean sections for her pregnancies, and she had her antenatal care for her third pregnancy at a referral hospital. She was diagnosed with preeclampsia during her third pregnancy for which she received 250 mg alpha-methyl-dopa twice a day. \u200b\u200bDuring the 30th week of gestation, the patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure became labile, oscillating between 140 and 150 mmHg, despite her antihypertension medication. The patient consulted at a district hospital where she underwent a fetal wellbeing ultrasound which did not find anomalies.\nThe patient was the 7th of 9 children, and her father was hypertensive. She weighed 72 kg for 155 cm, and upon arrival at the authors\u2019 hospital, her blood pressure was 217/152 mmHg. Her heart rate was 101 bpm, her respiratory rate was 24 cpm, and SpO2 was 96% free air. The patient was in pain, she was lucid and coherent, her palpebral conjunctivae were colored, and she had bilateral pitting edema. The fundus height was at 30 cm, the presentation was cephalic, the fetus was bradycardic at 88 bpm, and there were no signs of genital bleeding. The cervix was median, soft, 80% effaced with a 2 cm dilation. Urine deep stick revealed 3+ proteinuria. She had 1.5 mg/dL of creatinine (normal: 0.5\u20131.5 mg/dL), 22 mg/dL of urea (normal: 10\u201350 mg/dL), 15,000 white blood cells/ml, 213,000 platelets/ml and 14 g/dL hemoglobin. Based on these findings, we indicated an emergency cesarean section for acute fetal distress, which resulted in the extraction of a dead infant.\nPostoperative suites were marked on day two by decompensated anemia (hemoglobin at 7.8 mg/dL) for which the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells. On postoperative day three, the patient presented an abdominal effusion, exacerbation of the bilateral pitting edema, blood pressure increase, hematemesis, melena, petechiae, hematuria, and oliguria. Her blood pressure was 215/120 mmHg and she had signs of renal failure (creatinine = 6.9 mg/dL (normal: 0.84\u20131.21 mg/dL); urea 132.5 mg/dL (normal: 5\u201320 mg/dL); hyperkalemia at 6.4 mmol/L (normal: 3.5\u20135 mmol/L); hyponatremia 109 mmol/L (normal: 136\u2013145 mmol/L); hypocalcemia 0.88 mmol/L (normal: 1.12\u20131.32 mmol/L)), and signs of hepatic failure (AST 135 IU/L, normal: < 33 IU/L; ALT 325 IU/L, normal: < 33 IU/L; prothrombin ratio 100% (normal: 80\u2013110%). PTT was 39 s (normal: 24\u201335 s), LDH was 1398 IU/L (normal: 120\u2013280 IU/L), and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (normal: 0-1 mg/dL)). She equally had neutrophilic leukocytosis at 22,180 cells/mm3 and low platelets at 44,000 cells/mm3. Additionally, schistocytes were identified in the peripheral thin smear.\nThe team excluded TTP and HELLP syndrome as possible causes of the postpartum microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). This decision was based on the history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was retained as the final diagnosis, and in the absence of anti-complement therapy, the patient underwent four sessions of hemodialysis. Hypertension was treated with Nicardipine, 5 mg/hr. IV with a 2.5 mg/hr. increase every 15 min without exceeding 15 mg/hr., and the goal was to lower the systolic blood pressure below 160 mmHg. Hyperkalemia was corrected with insulin and glucose (10 units of insulin dose with 25 g of glucose per each 1 mmol/L of potassium above the normal). A favorable clinical and biologic evolution was observed, and the patient was released for outpatient follow-up on postoperative day 18 (Figs. , and ).\nLaboratory tests could not be obtained more frequently due to their financial burden to the patient and her immediate family. The patient had a normal kidney function at postoperative day 160 (urea 24.2 g/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL) and postoperative day 202 (urea 16.9 g/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL). She did not present new episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

According to these findings, the patient was diagnosed with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome secondary to topical steroid use. For adrenal insufficiency, 20 mg/day hydrocortisone treatment was commenced, and for vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D replacement. As the patient had high blood glucose levels, dyslipidemia, and large waist circumference (101 cm), he was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, and a low-calorie diet and exercise were advised. Metformin treatment at a dose of 2000 mg/day was commenced for glucose regulation. The patient consulted at the dermatology department for his psoriasis, and calcipotriol pomade and emollients were prescribed. One (1) month after that, 1 \u03bcg tetracosactide i.v. was applied and cortisol levels were measured at 30 min and at 60 min. As both measured levels were below 3 \u03bcg/dL, glucocorticoid maintenance treatment was continued. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

Six months prior, she\nhad similar pain. An upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy at that time showed\npeptic ulcer disease and no other mucosal lesions. The patient had a strong family\nhistory of renal disease and 2 of her siblings required a renal transplant, but she\ndid not know what kidney pathology they had. Her medications included Lisinopril\noral 10 mg tablet daily and Pantoprazole oral 40 mg daily. On presentation at the\nemergency room (ER), her height and weight were 157 cm and 61 kg, respectively, and\nher blood pressure was 206/121 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient had\nepigastric tenderness. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.\nRadiology was ordered to exclude any anatomical abnormality. A computed tomography\nscan showed neither atrophy nor enlargement of the kidneys. She then followed up as\nan outpatient with a nephrologist shortly after her ER visit. Her laboratory work up\nduring that visit revealed the following: nephrotic range proteinuria (9.2 g protein\non 24-hour urine collection; reference range, 0-2.5 g/d), hypoalbuminemia (300\n\u00b5mol/L; reference range, 421-662 \u00b5mol/L), hypoproteinemia (50 g/L; reference range,\n60-80 g/L), elevated serum creatinine (148.5 \u00b5mol/L; reference range, 44-80 \u03bcmol/L),\nhigh chloride (110 mmol/L; reference range, 98-106 mmol/L), and low hemoglobin (100\ng/L; reference range, 120-160 g/L).

    "question": "A 73-yr-old woman with atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency room complaining of chest discomfort, dyspnea, and agitation. The patient had suffered from atrial fibrillation for the last 2 yr. Her medications for the previous 2 yr included diltiazem 90 mg, metoprorol 25 mg, and aspirin 100 mg twice a day. In addition, she had been taking mirtazapine 30 mg, alprazolam 0.25 mg, and zolpidem 10 mg daily for a 6 yr history of dysthymia.\nPhysical examination showed a blood pressure of 100/83 mmHg, a heart rate of 100 beats/min, and a normal body temperature. Her body weight was 62.3 kg, and she was 158 cm in height. Initial laboratory results were unremarkable with a normal PT of 12.3 sec (INR 1.0). Routine chemical studies indicated normal values for total protein (6.6 g/dL), albumin (3.9 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (17 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (10 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (79 U/L), total bilirubin (0.3 mg/dL) blood urea nitrogen (16.4 mg/dL), creatinine (0.6 mg/dL), and electrolytes. Results of hematological studies including complete blood counts were also normal. Mild cardiomegaly was found on the chest radiography. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Echocardiogram revealed mild aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation and left atrial enlargement (45 mm).\nThe patient underwent heparinization with an initial bolus administration of 3,600 IU heparin followed by continuous infusion for 6 days. Then the patient was started on 2 or 3 mg of warfarin daily (16.3 mg/week) to prevent thromboembolism, and was discharged after 3 days with a PT of 37.4 sec (INR 2.81). When she revisited the outpatient clinic after 3 days, her PT was found to be 50.0 sec (INR 3.68). After normalization of the patient's PT with warfarin withdrawal for 3 days, 1 or 2 mg/day (10.5 mg/week) of warfarin was prescribed. The PT after 3 days of treatment was 41.6 sec (INR 3.11). The administration of warfarin dose was changed (6.5-10.5 mg/week) continuously, which resulted in a PT of 20.9-43.1 sec (INR 1.64-3.21). She had to discontinue warfarin therapy temporarily 3 times. The difficulty in finding the optimal treatment dose during the induction period of anticoagulation continued for more than 2 month.\nThe patient continues to receive warfarin therapy at the outpatient clinic monthly and her PT remains within the recommended target therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0), even though her warfarin dose has been reduced to 6.5 mg/week.\nThe patient was genotyped for CYP2C9 after informed consent. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and all 9 exons of the CYP2C9 gene were amplified by PCR (-). The PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISIM BigDye terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.). The patient was found to be an intermediate metabolizer with the genotype of CYP2C9*3/*4 (). What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

Other biochemistry values were as follows: serum creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 24 mg/dL, potassium 4.6 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.6 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 86 U/L, albumin 4.1 g/dL, and creatinine kinase 436 mg/dL. He had proteinuria (trace) and glycosuria (4+) on urinalysis.\nSerial blood culture showed no evidence of bacterial infection. As infectious causes were thought to be less likely, we conducted arterial and venous doppler ultrasonography of the extremity to exclude vascular problems such as deep vein thrombosis or peripheral artery disease. There was no evidence of vascular structural abnormality, but an ill-defined hyperechoic lesion and thick fluid collection in the right vastus medialis muscle was found. After four days, the amount of fluid increased, and thus fluid aspiration at the intermuscular fascial plane adjacent to the vastus lateralis was done (). The fluid was clear, watery and serous. Gram stain and culture of the fluid were negative. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the right thigh reflected diffuse edema around the vastus medialis with low signal intensity on T1 () and high signal intensity on T2 images (). The three-phase bone scan showed increased blood flow to the right thigh consistent with myonecrosis as shown on the thigh MRI (). The bone scan also revealed increased blood flow at the right medial tibial condyle consistent with an insufficiency fracture, which was subsequently confirmed by X-ray and MRI (). Since these clinical findings and images were highly suggestive of DMI of the right vastus medialis with insufficient fracture of the right tibial condyle, a muscle biopsy was not performed.\nDue to the early onset of disease (age 27), no obesity and no family history of T2D, we needed to clearly identify the exact type of his diabetes. Baseline C-peptide level was very low (0.1 ng/mL) and did not sufficiently rise at 6 min after glucagon stimulation test (0.3 ng/mL). Antinuclear antibodies, and anti-IA2 antibody results were not significant, but antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD Ab) were positive (2.0 U/mL). Other immunologic factors were negative. Considering his age, low BMI, positive anti-GAD Ab, and severely decreased C-peptide level, we diagnosed his diabetes as a case of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). After we examined microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications, he was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and non-proliferative retinopathy of both eyes as well as microalbuminuria based on spot urine analysis (152 \u00b5g/mg Creatinine).\nWhen we evaluated the cause of the insufficiency fracture, we found that his bone mineral density (BMD) was reduced, with T-scores of -3.9 (Z-score -3.3) at L1-L4 and -2.7 (Z-score -2.3) at the femur neck. Due to the young age of the patient, we also evaluated possible etiologies of secondary osteoporosis, including hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism, and glucocorticoid excess. 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-[OH]D) level was also lower than the normal limits (<4 ng/mL, normal range 11.1 to 42.9) and osteocalcin level was slightly decreased (2.4 ng/mL, normal range 2.7 to 11.5). Thyroid function test was normal (free-T4 0.90 ng/dL, normal range 0.77 to 1.94 ng/dL; Thyroid stimulating hormone 2.24 \u00b5U/mL, normal range 0.30 to 4.00 \u00b5U/mL; T3 120 ng/dL, normal range 80 to 200 ng/dL), and there was no significant finding of thyroid autoantibodies. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 19.6 pg/mL (normal range 13 to 54 pg/mL). C-telopeptide level was within normal limits (0.74 ng/mL, normal range 0.07 to 0.78 ng/mL). Testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were also within normal limits (Testosterone 2.19 ng/mL, normal range, 1.8 to 8.96 ng/mL; FSH 4.0 ng/mL, normal range, 2.8 to 9.6 ng/mL), with a slightly low luteinizing hormone level (1.3 ng/mL, normal range, 1.8 to 5.2 ng/mL).\nAntibiotics were initially prescribed, but discontinued when bacterial infection was ruled out and DMI was thought to be the most likely clinical diagnosis. Instead, the patient was treated with analgesics such as acetaminophen, application of a long leg splint and bed rest, and multiple daily injections of insulin for strict glucose control. For his osteoporotic fracture, he was administered oral vitamin D and calcium agents. After about two weeks of supportive management, the tenderness and swelling of the right anteromedial thigh gradually reduced and the patient was able to walk without help, and so the splint was removed. 3 months later, when the hyperglycemia was controlled, we have done the oral glucose tolerance test and calculated the insulinogenic index (IGI, delta insulin 30 min-0 min/delta glucose 30 min-0 min). Calculated IGI was 0 (reference range >0.5), which reflects diminished beta-cell function on glucose stimulation. On follow-up ultrasonography after 6 months, the myonecrosis of the right vastus medialis muscle was dramatically resolved and his HbA1c had improved to 5.7%. In addition, his 25-(OH)D level had risen to 58.7 ng/mL after 6 months of treatment. Five months after treatment, the patient complained of frequent injections, so we changed his insulin regimen to a premixed combination insulin injection twice a day. He is currently under follow-up at the outpatient clinic without any evidence of recurrence. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

    "question": "A 43-year old male presented with a history of proteinuria discovered on a routine medical examination in 1985 when he was 22 years old. His medical history was acute pancreatitis at age 17 and hypertension at age 40, and the family history indicated that his nephew had IgA nephropathy. The patient occasionally consumes alcohol, but doesn\u2019t smoke. The patient visited a local doctor and underwent a renal biopsy for suspected active nephritis because of the finding (Table ) of hematuria 3+ protein from pooled urine 0.78 g/day and a plasma creatinine (Cr) level of 1.16 mg/dl [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 71 ml/min/1.73 m2]. Pathologic examination revealed IgA nephropathy with partial cellular crescent formation in 1 of the 12 glomeruli, slight mesangial matrix expansion, and mild atrophy of the renal tubule and interstitium. He was followed up without treatment, and the urinary abnormalities resolved spontaneously. He stopped visiting the hospital 3 years after the first visit because of the repeated negative urine analysis and did not visit any other hospital thereafter. He continued to undergo routine medical examinations, which were intermittently positive for microhematuria and proteinuria. His next visit to a medical institution was in 2002 at 38 years of age and revealed urine protein 2+, urine occult blood 1+, plasma Cr 1.13 mg/dl and hypertension. An angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) was started. After that, he saw a doctor regularly, but hematuria and proteinuria became gradually worse. A relapse of IgA nephropathy was suspected. In March 2009, he was admitted to a hospital for renal biopsy to evaluate the progression of IgA nephropathy.\nThe patient's general condition at the time of hospitalization was height 163.0 cm, weight 55.0 kg, body mass index 20.7 kg/m2, blood pressure 116/72 mmHg, heart rate 83 beats/min and temperature 36.6 \u00b0C. He was lucid with no sign of anemia in the palpebral conjunctiva. No swelling of the throat, abnormal chest auscultation, hard and tender points in the abdominal area or edema of the extremities was observed. Medical examinations (Table ) revealed urine protein 3+ (0.90 g/day), urine occult blood 3+ (RBC 10\u201319/HPF) and serum Cr 1.63 mg/dl.\nRenal biopsy (Fig. ) showed 4 global scleroses, 3 cellular crescent formations and 3 adhesions in 28 glomeruli; moderate expansion of the mesangial matrix; moderate tubular atrophy with mild cell infiltration in the interstitium; and moderate arteriolosclerosis and thickening of interlobular arteries. Immunostaining of IgA confirmed the diagnosis of active chronic-progressive IgA nephropathy.\nAfter admission, the patient was treated with tonsillectomy and steroid pulse therapy. Steroid pulse therapy was given as follows: methylprednisolone was administered continuously at a pulsed dose of 500 mg/day for 3 days, followed by oral prednisolone at a dose of 30 mg continuously for 3 weeks. After completion of the third course, oral prednisolone was initiated at a dose of 30 mg/day every other day after treatment and tapered by 5 mg every 2 months. The after-treatment follow-up was continued for 1 year. The patient underwent tonsillectomy after discharge from the hospital (day 75) and was then followed up at the outpatient clinic. He completed oral prednisolone treatment in approximately a year, but continued taking an ARB during the follow-up period. Clinical remission was achieved 7 months after the initiation of therapy (Table ), and hematuria and proteinuria were no longer observed in this 3-year follow-up period (Fig. ).

    "question": "A 57-year-old-male patient 165 cm tall, and weighing 68 kg in the ASA 1 risk group because of numbness of his left wrist. The biochemical parameters of the patient who was scheduled for operation under regional anesthesia with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome were as follows; Hb:14.0 mg/dL, Htc:43.0%, Plt:229000/mm3, WBC:6000/mm3, FBG:100 mg/dL, BUN:2817 mg/dL, Creatinine:0.7 mg/dL, AST:20.72 mg/dL, and ALT:12.45 mg/dL. His electrocardiogram (EKC) revealed a HR of 70 bpm with normal sinus rhythm.\nPreoperatively the patient was informed about axillary nerve blockade, and his written informed consent was obtained. He didn\u2019t receive any preoperative premedication, and in the operating room, his standard EKG, peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2), and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) were monitores. Using a 18 G branule a vein on the back of his left hand was punctured, and 0.09%NaCl infusion at a rate of 200 ml/hr was initiated. Right arm to be operated was positioned at 90\u00b0 abduction with the torso, and forearm was flexed 90\u00b0. After cleansing the surgical field with a sterile antibacterial solution, the site was covered with sterile drape, and a single injection was made with a 22 G x 50 mm needle (Stimuplex\u00ae Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Retrograde blood was not observed during negative aspiration.\nUsing a peripheral nerve stimulator (Stimuplex A; B.Braun Melsungen AG, B.Braun Medical AG CH-6021, Germany) at an intensity of 1.5 mA the nerve was localized. When the intensity of the electrical current was reduced to 0.5 mA, nervous stimuli were observed which made us to think that we were on the innervation site of the nerve to be blocked. Then 40 mL anesthetic solution preprepared by anesthesia technician which we thought to be our routinely used mixture i.e. [20 mL 1% lidocaine (2 ampoules of 2% lidocaine, and 10 mL NaCl 0.09%) and 20 mL 1% prilocaine (10 mL 2% prilocaine, and 10 mL0,09% NaCl)] was injected to the patient with negative suctions after each application of 5 mL. Injection site was compressed for 5 minutes. Nearly 10 minutes later the patient felt numbness on his tongue, irritability, restlessness, agitation, he uttered meaningless words, and moved his arms, and legs senselessly. Decreased peripheral oxygen saturation and presence of peripheral cyanosis led us to make an initial diagnosis of methemoglobinemia, and supportive O2 therapy was initiated via oxygen mask at a rate of 6 lt per minute. We couldn\u2019t measure methemoglobin levels because of lack of necessity facilities. Arterial blood gas measurements were as follows. pH: 7.43 pO2:60.1, and pCO2:44.0. Respiratory distress of the patient increased, and deepened, with a drop in his SpO2 to 76, was intubated under 1 mg/kg propofol, 1 \u00b5/kg fentanyl, and 0.5 mg.kg\u22121 rocuronium anesthesia to enjure the patency of his airway. For the post-intubation maitenance of anesthesia 50 oxygen \u2013nitrogen, and 1 mac sevoflurane were used. Following induction of anesthesia, hypotension (NIBP: 60/40 mmHg), and bradycardia (HR:40 bpm) developed which required administration of 0.5 mg atropin, and intermittent IV injections of ephedrine (total dose 30 mg). When his health state was stabilized, NIBP values improved, and his HR dropped to 70 bpm with SpO2: 95%, he was amenable for surgery. At the end of the operation which lasted for nearly half an hour, the patient was awakened with injections of 10 \u00b5g/kg atropine, and 40 \u00b5g/kg neostigmine. Thoughy the patient still continued to articulate meaningless words, and make senseless movements, since he was more cooperative we transferred the patient into the intensive care unit.\nWhen we discerned that in place of 2% lidocaine ampoule which we always requested as a local anesthetic from the pharmacy, 10% lidocaine ampoule was sent, and anesthetic mixture was prepared without checking whether it was 2% lidocaine, we made the diagnosis of local anesthetic intoxication related to wrong formulation of lidocaine rather than methemoglobinemia\nDuring 24-hour monitorization in the intensive care unit his hemodynamic parameters were stable, and his complaints resolved. Then the patient was traansferred to his service with relevant recommendations. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI.

    "question": "A 51-year-old gentleman, recently diagnosed to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and systemic hypertension, presented to the cardiology outpatient clinic on 28th July 2016 with history of pricking chest pain and shortness of breath for the past 7 years and recurrent attacks of syncope since the previous year. He weighed 49 kg and with a height of 157 cm; body mass index was 19.88 kg/m2. His blood pressure (BP) was 120/80 mmHg and pulse rate was 78/min and regular in rhythm. He was afebrile. Systemic examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory findings revealed hemoglobin of 15.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 47%, white blood cell count of 11,300/mm3 (differential count of neutrophils of 56%, lymphocytes 26%, eosinophils 11%, and monocytes of 7%), and platelet count of 293,000/mm3. Urine on routine examination showed a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1015, and was negative for albumin, glucose, red blood cells, and pus cells. Blood glucose fasting was 115 mg/dL and post-prandial was 219 mg/dL with an HbA1C of 7.1%. Blood urea was 27 mg/dL and creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, and bicarbonate 28 mEq/L. Serum cholesterol was 183 mg/dL, serum triglyceride 121 mg/dL, and serum uric acid 3.9 mg/dl. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular dimensions, no regional wall motion abnormality, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 69%. Holter monitoring showed occasional supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes. On 2nd August, coronary angiography showed insignificant coronary artery disease with dominant right coronary system and he was discharged with medical advice.\nOn 3rd August, he attended emergency department with complaints of severe back pain, palpitation, and sweating. His back pain was sudden in onset, gradually progressive, throbbing type, rating 8/10 in pain scale, radiating to the left flank, aggravated by exertion, and partially relieved by rest. He had no other complaints. He was on metformin and calcium channel blocker. He looked anxious, agitated, and restless but was oriented and afebrile. His pulse rate was 112/min, respiratory rate was 28/min, and BP was 210/120 mmHg in the right upper limb and 210/100 mmHg over the left upper limb in supine position. There was no radio-femoral delay. Systemic examination was unremarkable except for a mild tenderness in the lumbar region.\nOn investigation, electrocardiography, chest X-ray, complete blood counts, liver function tests, 2D echocardiography, urine analysis, and toxicology screen were all within normal limits. Serum amylase and lipase were normal. Blood urea was 58 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 2 mg/dL. Venous blood gas (VBG) analysis showed a pH of 7.21, bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, base excess of \u22129.4 mmol/L, and a lactate of 10.81 mmol/L. Serum electrolytes were sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 108 mmol/L, and anion gap was 12 mmol/L.\nThe following were considered in the differential diagnosis of this situation: (a) acute mesentric ischemia, (b) aortic dissection (c) hypertensive emergency, and (d) pancreatitis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography abdomen showed a lesion in the left adrenal gland measuring about 3.5 \u00d7 3.2 cm with mild enhancement in the arterial phase, features consistent with pheochromocytoma [: Contrast enhanced CT scan of abdomen showing the mildly enhancing left adrenal mass]. No additional extra-adrenal tumors were seen. There was no evidence of mesenteric ischemia, aortic dissection, or pancreatitis. Upon further questioning his family members, it was known that he was unwell in the previous 6 months with on and off headache, palpitation, and anxiousness, which they attributed to the recently diagnosed diabetes mellitus.\nHis BP was managed with alpha adreno-receptor blocker and calcium channel blocker. Phenoxybenzamine was added at a dose of 10 mg twice a day and later increased to 20 mg three times daily. Persistent tachycardia and BP were stabilized with addition of beta blocker.\nOn 5th August 2016, the level of 24-h urine metanephrines was 14,536 mcg (reference range: less than 350 mcg/24 h) and nor-metanephrines was 7,607 mcg (reference range: less than 600 mcg/24 h).\nLaparoscopic removal of pheochromocytoma was done under general anesthesia on 12th August 2016. After the surgery, there was a brief episode of hypoglycemia and hypotension, which was managed with 25% dextrose and normal saline, respectively. Azotemia resolved and blood gases were normalized. Pathological examination of the resected mass revealed a well-encapsulated tumor of size 5 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm, without hemorrhage. It showed polygonal and round cells with abundant cytoplasm and increased vasculature. There was no capsular or vascular invasion. Tumor cells were seen in the background of spindle cells with ganglion cells and Schwanian stroma. These features were reported as consistent with a CP\u2013ganglioneuroma of the left adrenal gland []. Immunohistochemistry examination showed positivity for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 stains and negativity for calretinin in pheochromocytoma cells. Calretinin, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 stains were positive in the ganglioneuromatous component. Vimentin was positive and cytokeratin was negative. These staining characteristics confirmed the composite nature of the tumor.\nAt the time of discharge, his blood pressure and blood glucose were normal. Upon review on 28th February 2017, his BP was 130/80 mmHg without antihypertensive medicine. Blood glucose fasting was 90 mg/dL and post-prandial 66 mg/dL, with an HbA1C of 6.1% without any antidiabetic medicine. The levels of 24-h urinary metanephrines and normetanephrines were 62 and 604, mcg, respectively. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

In the initial 2-3 days of his illness, he had 2-3 seizures daily for which he received carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily. Seizure though was controlled, but he started having carpopedal spasms lasting for 1-2 min. His elder brother aged 16 years also had similar illness. Examination revealed that the patient was of average built and nutrition (height 157.5 cm, weight 48kg) and there were no dysmorphic features. The neurological examination was normal except Trousseau\u2019s sign.\nThe laboratory studies revealed normal hemoglobin and blood counts.

He had just returned to\nJapan from traveling in southeastern Asia for 1 week. He had no relevant past medical\nhistory and was not on medication. He had developed pain in the right lower mandibular\narea over the past week. The pain had progressed from the neck to the chest; he\ndeveloped a high fever during his journey and could not eat or drink. In the emergency\nroom, peripheral oxygen saturation was 95% with receiving oxygen at 15 L/min via an\noxygen mask and a reservoir bag. A chest X-ray showed a slightly widened mediastinum\nwith pleural effusion (). An\nECG revealed widespread ST-elevation (). Physical examination revealed a body mass index of 23.0 kg/m2\n(height 168.0 cm; weight 65.0 kg), blood pressure of 121/68 mmHg, average heart rate of\n110/min, respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, body temperature of 37.9\u00b0C, and\ntenderness and redness in the anterior and bilateral sides of the neck. White blood cell\ncount was 14,510/\u00b5L, neutrophils were 11,320/\u00b5L, red blood cell count\nwas 5.07\u00d7106/\u00b5L, hemoglobin was 14.7 g/dL, and the platelet\ncount was 196,000/\u00b5L. C-reactive protein level was elevated at 54.52 mg/dL (ref.\n0.0\u20130.14 mg/dL). Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were 45 mg/dL (ref.\n8\u201320 mg/dL) and 1.06 mg/dL (ref. 0.65\u20131.07 mg/dL), respectively. Lactate\ndehydrogenase was elevated to 510 U/L (ref. 124\u2013222 U/L). Creatine kinase and\ncreatine kinase-MB were 269 (ref. 59\u2013248 U/L) and 11.6 (ref. 0.0\u201312.0\nU/L), respectively. The fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels were normal. Although\nthese findings indicated the possibility of acute pericarditis, an ECG did not show any\nfindings of pericarditis or myocardial dysfunction. Contrast-enhanced CT images revealed\nthat a large volume of gas had collected in the neck and upper and anterior mediastinum\n(). In addition,\nan abscess had formed in the retropharyngeal, bilateral sub-mandibular, upper\nparatracheal, and mediastinal spaces with pleural effusion and atelectasis in the right\nlower basal lobe (). Thus, DNM induced by odontogenic infection with a right mandibular\nsecond or third molar abscess was highly suspected.\nA multidisciplinary team, including physicians, otolaryngologists, surgeons, and\nintensivists commenced treatment within 2 hours of arrival. He received intravenous 600\nmg clindamycin bid and 4.5 g tazobactam/piperacil-lin hydrate qid. A tracheostomy,\nbilateral neck drainage, neck fasciotomy, and debridement via a cervical incision were\nperformed 5 hours after arrival. The blood culture on admission was negative.\nGram-positive cocci were found in sputum and pus, and Streptococcus\npyogenes, Streptococcus constellatus, Fusobacterium\nnecrophorum, and Peptostreptococcus sp. were found later in\npus culture. Continuous bilateral thoracic drainage began due to the development of a\nbilateral pyothorax. Subsequently, the transcervical mediastinal and right mediastinal\nareas were drained via thoracotomy. His condition improved steadily, and he was\ndischarged without any comorbidities on hospital day 63 after admission. Pathological\nfindings from the excised skeletal muscle and fascia indicated acute inflammation with\nnecrosis (),\nconsistent with necrotizing fasciitis, and a large number of Gram-positive cocci were\nobserved ().

    "question": "A 66-year-old man (body height, 168 cm; body weight, 88.5 kg) experienced dyspnea, a sensation of chest tightness, and back pain for a few days before he was brought to our hospital on an emergency basis. His symptoms became aggravated suddenly as he was about to get off a taxi on his way home from work. He presented with a history of close contact with a coworker with COVID-19 and was waiting for instructions from a public health center.\nIn the ambulance, the following conditions were documented: Glasgow Coma Scale score, E4V5M6; heart rate, 80/min and irregular; blood pressure, 100/60 mmHg; body temperature, 38.4\u00baC; oxygen saturation, 98% (O2 delivered with reservoir mask at a rate of 15 L/min). On admission, his white blood cell count was 22,300/\u00b5L; hemoglobin, 14.7 g/dL; platelet count, 35 \u00d7 104/\u00b5L; creatinine level, 2.23 mg/dL; creatine kinase level, 2582 IU/L; creatine kinase myocardial band level, 164 ng/mL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 97 mg/dL; high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol level, 19 mg/dL; triglyceride level, 173 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c level, 7.9%; C-reactive protein level, 13.8 mg/dL; troponin T level, 9.640 ng/mL; N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, 11753 pg/mL; procalcitonin level, 0.62 ng/mL; d-dimer level, 16.34 \u00b5g/mL; and soluble fibrin level, 113.1 \u00b5g/mL. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation; ST-elevation in II, III, aVF, and V2\u2013V6 leads; and ST depression in aVR leads (Figure ). Echocardiography revealed severe hypokinesis extending from the anterior wall to the apex and the inferior wall in left ventricle, with an approximate ejection fraction of 20%. We diagnosed STEMI and decided to perform emergency coronary angiography (CAG). A chest radiograph showed infiltrative shadows in both lungs and tracheal intubation was performed in the emergency outpatient unit (Figure ). Continuous infusion of noradrenaline (0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min) was started because his systolic blood pressure dropped below 80 mmHg. After heparin (5,000 U) was administered intravenously, the patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization room.\nCAG was performed by cardiologists, emergency physicians, clinical engineers, nurses, and radiological technologists who donned appropriate personal protective equipment before entering the room. CAG revealed total occlusion of the middle of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD; Figure ). After a loading dose of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, 162 mg; clopidogrel, 300 mg), an intra-aortic balloon pump catheter was inserted, and a 7-Fr guiding catheter was inserted into the left coronary artery. We removed white material, which did not at a first glance appear to be a typical thrombus, with an aspiration catheter, but blood flow did not improve. The onset-to-device time and door-to-device time were 116 and 84 minutes, respectively. Subsequent intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) revealed several structures, which were thought to be thrombi; therefore, we performed plain old balloon angioplasty (Figure ). After the balloon was expanded, blood flow improved slightly in the LAD but not distally. Next, we placed an everolimus-eluting stent (4.0 \u00d7 38 mm) in the middle of the LAD, but peripheral blood flow was still not observed. Repeated IVUS revealed severe stenosis caused by plaque with thrombi. An additional balloon was inflated at the distal site, and a cutting balloon was also used. Another everolimus-eluting stent (2.25 \u00d7 38 mm) was placed at the distal site, but no blood flow improvements were seen angiographically.\nWe moved a double-lumen catheter to the distal LAD and performed CAG from the distal LAD, which revealed retrograde blood flow up to the middle of the LAD and collateral circulation from the septal branch to the RCA. Repeated IVUS examination revealed thrombi and plaque at the distal end of the stent and no intrastent blood flow (Figure ). Then, we tried to perform PCI for the total occlusion of RCA, but it was unsuccessful. At this point, 7 hours passed since the patient entered the cardiac catheterization room, and so we finished the procedure. The levels of activated clotting time during PCI were maintained at 280\u2013310 seconds. After PCI, pathological examination proved the aspirated white material was white thrombi. Chest computed tomography performed after PCI showed ground-glass opacities distributed unevenly in both the lungs, as well as left-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). After the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, he showed pulseless electrical activity, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved with 1 mg of epinephrine and one cycle of CPR. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was considered, but his family decided against it. The blood pressure was maintained through the continuous administration of noradrenaline, dobutamine, and adrenaline. His nasopharyngeal swab was tested with polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19-related pneumonia was diagnosed. Remdesivir treatment was initiated at a dose of 200 mg/day on the 5th day of hospitalization and continued at 100 mg/day. Because of the possibility of concomitant bacterial pneumonia, ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium (9 g/day) was also administered. However, the patient's oxygenation level worsened, and he died on the 7th day. It was difficult to confirm a main cause of death because we were not permitted to dissect patients due to COVID-19. We assumed that he had died from both cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction and septic shock due to covid-19 infection.

    "question": "A 17-year-old male presented with a few days history of severe headache, visual disturbances, and a few episodes of vomiting. There was no history of fever, altered consciousness, seizures, or upper or lower limb weakness. The past medical history was unremarkable. At the time of examination, his BP was 240/130 mm Hg. The fundus examination revealed bilateral papilledema with grade 4 hypertensive changes. The neurological examination revealed normal grade 5 power in all four limbs with normally elicited deep tendon reflexes. The sensory examination was unremarkable with normal flexor plantar response bilaterally. Serum electrolytes were normal; kidney function tests were deranged (blood urea 86 mg/dL, serum creatinine 3.7 mg/dL). A renal biopsy revealed features of IgA nephropathy. MRI of the brain revealed a hyperintense signal of medulla and cervical cord on T2 and FLAIR images (Figures ); small hyperintense foci were also noted in the parieto-occipital regions and deep cerebellar white matter. The lesions were also hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (because of T2 shine-through); there was no evidence of restricted diffusion on apparent diffusion co-efficient maps. As there was no clinical or lab evidence to support the diagnosis of encephalomyelitis or acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) as suggested initially by the radiologist, an atypical variant of PRES was considered as the most plausible diagnostic possibility. Further investigations including CSF studies were not considered necessary in view of the strongly suggestive clinical and imaging features. The patient rapidly improved with antihypertensive treatment and a repeat MRI done 1 month afterward showed resolution of the earlier imaging findings.

    "question": "A 63-year-old female on maintenance hemodialysis was admitted to our hospital for an initial generalized tonic seizure suffered at home. Just after admission, a second generalized tonic seizure was observed. During the seizure, conjugate eye deviation toward the upper left was noted. On admission, her pulse rate was 92 beats/min, blood pressure 134/92 mm Hg, and body temperature 36.5\u00b0C. Neither abnormal heart sounds nor rales were noted on auscultation. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no mass lesion, hemorrhage, or infarction (Figures and ). Electroencephalography showed repetition of intermittent high-amplitude irregular slow waves in the right frontal lobe (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with generalized partial seizures. After administration of phenytoin sodium, the seizures resolved, and neurological findings normalized. According to her medical record, she had no history of diabetes mellitus or coronary artery disease, nor any family history of coronary artery disease. She had been stable on maintenance hemodialysis for 32 years, and the appropriate dry weight was maintained. Kt/V (urea) was 1.48. Her administration had included fentanyl patch, etizolam, rabeprazole sodium, celecoxib, lactomin, camostat mesilate, tocopherol nicotinate, acetaminophen, and mecobalamin. On admission, electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal.\nOn the second hospital day, ECG showed inverted T waves and QT prolongation in all leads without chest pain, dyspnea, or any other cardiac symptoms. Neurological findings were normal. Blood test findings were as follows: creatinine, 6.46 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 55 mg/dL; sodium, 141 mEq/L; potassium, 5.3 mEq/L; calcium, 8.9 g/dL; phosphorus, 7.0 mg/dL; hemoglobin, 12.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 19 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 8 IU/L; creatine kinase, 312 IU/L; and cardiac troponin t-test, negative (Troponin T kit; TROP T sensitive, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany: cutoff value is 0.1 ng/mL). Thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) did not show any abnormal findings. Echocardiography demonstrated left apical akinesis. On the third hospital day, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization. While coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries, left ventriculography showed extensive severe hypokinesis in the anteroseptal and apical segments with hyperkinesis in the basal segments (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\nWe followed with serial ECG monitoring for several weeks. Her clinical course of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was uneventful and seizure had not been seen. After two months, left ventricular apical wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography had reversed, and the inverted T waves and QT prolongation on ECG had also resolved ().

    "question": "A 61-year-old Caucasian man presented to the emergency department in autumn with one week of dyspnea, productive cough, myalgia, and fever. He denied any chest pain or hemoptysis. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma with receipt of an allogeneic stem cell transplant 13 years prior. Given prior complications due to graft versus host disease, he was receiving prednisone at a maintenance dose of 15 mg daily for several years. He had multiple documented allergies to penicillin, sulfa drugs, macrolides and fluoroquinolones, with reported reactions including rash, hives, and anaphylaxis. Approximately one week prior to the onset of symptoms, he was traveling in the Midwest United States with his partner and staying in various hotels.\nUpon arrival to the hospital, he was noted to have a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 128/76 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 89% requiring eight liters of supplementary oxygen, and an oral temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F). He was in acute respiratory distress and had evident decreased breath sounds and crackles bilaterally. He was noted to have normal heart sounds without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. He did not have any rash on examination.\nLaboratory investigations revealed a normal peripheral leukocyte count of 10.4 x 109 cells/L (10.4 x 103 cells/\u00b5L) , decreased hemoglobin of 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL), decreased platelet count of 96 x 109 cells/L (96 x 103 cells/\u00b5L), and increased creatinine of 676 \u00b5mol/L (7.65 mg/dL). His liver enzymes were normal. His initial chest radiograph revealed diffuse, bilateral air space opacities in the mid and lower lung zones (Figure ).\nTwo sets of blood cultures were collected and sputum samples were sent for culture as well as stains and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii). A nasopharyngeal sample was collected for respiratory virus PCR testing for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus. In addition, a serum cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCR and Legionella urine antigen were sent. He was empirically started on meropenem, vancomycin, oseltamivir, and intravenous pentamidine.\nDespite initiation of broad spectrum antimicrobials, he continued to deteriorate with increasing oxygen demands, persistent fever, hemodynamic instability, and worsening radiographic infiltrates (Figure ).\nSputum and blood cultures were negative for any bacterial growth; sputum stains and PCR were negative for P. jirovecii. His serum CMV PCR was negative. His nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory virus testing was negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus; however, his Legionella urine antigen was positive.\nAccording to his pharmacy records, he had previously received and tolerated a five-day course of moxifloxacin approximately one year prior to this hospital admission. Given his diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease, intravenous moxifloxacin therapy was initiated. However, shortly following receipt of his first dose of moxifloxacin, he developed an allergic reaction with a generalized, erythematous, maculopapular rash and angioedema, necessitating administration of epinephrine.\nGiven his documented allergies to both fluoroquinolones and macrolides, hemodynamic instability, and concern for poor gastrointestinal absorption of oral antimicrobials, he was subsequently treated with intravenous tigecycline with an initial, loading dose of 100 mg, followed by 50 mg twice daily for a total of 14 days of therapy. Intravenous doxycycline is not readily available in our institution. His oxygen requirements decreased and fever resolved following 48 hours of treatment with tigecycline. All other antimicrobials were discontinued once the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was made. There was no recurrence of infection after three months of follow-up; his repeat chest radiograph showed resolution of his bilateral air space opacities.\nLater in discussion with the North Dakota Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was determined that there was an ongoing outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease associated with five cases over a 13-month period; all cases including our patient had stayed at the same hotel. Subsequent environmental testing of the hotel was negative, but this may have been impacted by a recent deep clean of the hotel\u2019s ventilation system.

Fuchsinophilic protein deposition can be found at the mesangial region and subepithelial region, including fibrin crescent formation of one cell. The kidney tubular epithelium exhibited granular and vacuolar degeneration, as well as multifocal atrophy. The renal interstitium showed multishaped lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, together with mild thickening of the arteriole wall. Paraffin immunofluorescence revealed: Immunoglobulin (Ig) G (++), IgA (++), IgM (++), C3 (+), fall risk assessment (+), C1q (++), and granular deposition along the mesangial region and capillary wall. Combined with clinical findings, this condition was considered diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, with IV-G (A), AI = 11, and CI = 5. AI was scored as follows: Cellular proliferation (2 points), leukocyte infiltration (1 point), nuclear fragmentation/fibrinoid necrosis (2 points), cell crescent (0 points), Meyer's loop/thrombus (2 points), and interstitial monocyte infiltration (2 points). CI was scored as follows: Sclerosis (2 points), fibrin crescent (0 points), tubular atrophy (2 points), and interstitial fibrosis (2 points) (Figure ).\nAfter consideration of the renal puncture results, oral administration of prednisone was begun at 50 mg/d, and meanwhile, cyclophosphamide was applied through intravenous injection at a dosage of 1.0 g monthly, which lasted for a consecutive 6 mo and was stopped after an accumulative use of 6 g. The serum creatinine fluctuated within an approximate range of 120-160 \u03bcmol/L, and blood albumin fluctuated from approximately 29-35 g/L. Then, the patient began to take AZA 50 mg/d as maintenance treatment but experienced extensive alopecia and shedding of pubic hair on the 13th day after oral administration. Pharyngalgia appeared on the 14th day, and fever with a body temperature up to 42 \u2103 occurred on the 15th day. The patient came to the hospital for the second time. Physical examination revealed the following: Body temperature, 39.4 \u2103; pulse, 92 times/min; breath rate, 22 times/min; blood pressure, 182/100 mmHg. The patient exhibited clear consciousness and emotional distress; she presented scattered chromatosis on her skin, and a rash was found on the inner surface of the bilateral thighs. Pharyngeal congestion was noted, and the breath sounds of the two lungs were clear. The heart rate was 92 times/min. The abdomen was flat, soft, and free from tenderness or rebound tenderness, and there was no liver or spleen involvement. Routine blood work showed the following: Hemoglobin 72 g/L, white blood cell count 1.25 \u00d7 109/L, blood platelet count 13 \u00d7 109/L, lymphocyte ratio 95.7%, neutrophil ratio 1.6%, and neutrophil count 0.01 \u00d7 109/L (Figure ). The results of the bone marrow biopsy were as follows: Myelodysplasia low in the myelogram and focal hyperplasia in bone marrow tissue with active hyperplasia in some areas (Figure ). Routine urinalysis results were as follows: Protein (+), occult blood 2+, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity (3.58 \u00d7 104). TPMT genotyping testing (four single nucleotide polymorphisms, single base extension method) revealed the following: TPMT 3C gene polymorphism (719A>G) (this site is the most common gene mutation site in Asians) test result: A/A; TPMT 3B gene polymorphism (460G>A) test result: G/G; TPMT 2 gene polymorphism (238G>C) test result: G/G; no abnormity was found in any of the above results.

Although he was asymptomatic, proteinuria, and haematuria were detected during a screening test when he was 20 years old, and he was diagnosed with IgAN based on renal biopsy. Histopathological examination of renal biopsy specimens revealed mild mesangial proliferation (). Immunohistochemical examination revealed mesangial IgA (), IgG and C3 () depositions, and he was treated with corticosteroids. Thereafter, he moved to our city and continued to be treated here. Corticosteroids treatment was continued for 7 years and was subsequently tapered.\nPhysical examination following the appearance of purpura revealed purpuric rash without any pitting oedema on his legs. Blood pressure was 147/78 mmHg. Urinalysis showed (+++) urinary protein, no urinary glucose, 6\u201310 red blood cells/high power field, urinary protein was 1.4 g/g creatinine (Cr). A peripheral blood smear showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12,100 cells/mm3, red blood cell of 5.16 million cells/mm3, and platelets 192,000 cells/mm3. Serum haemoglobin was 16.6 g/dL and haematocrit 45.4%.

No written reports of blood sugar levels were available with patient at the time of admission. On verbal enquiry, he reported that blood sugars were always below 140 mg%. His blood sugars were well-controlled on medical nutrition therapy (diet with low glycemic index). He had never taken any anti-diabetic drugs. During this admission, blood investigations revealed fasting blood sugar of 142 g/dl, white blood cell count of 12700/c.mm, platelets of 48000 lacs/c.mm. Renal profile showed blood urea nitrogen of 33.4 mg/dl, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dl, sodium of 129 meq/l, and potassium of 3.9 meq/l. Liver function tests revealed total bilirubin level of 6.6 mg/dl, direct bilirubin level of 5.8 mg/dl, alanine amino-transferase level of 75 u/l, aspartate amino-transferase level of 103 u/l, alkaline phosphatase level of 202 u/l, total protein level of 5.8 g/dl and albumin level of 2.9 g/dl. Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) and anti Hepatitis C virus (HCV) were negative. Chest X-ray revealed right mid zone pneumonia and ultrasound abdomen was normal. Urine routine revealed 10-12 pus cells/high power field and later urine culture grew Escherichia coli. He was empirically started on i.v. moxifloxacin (400 mg) at admission and was managed symptomatically. Twenty four hours later i.v. cefepime/tazobactum combination was also added based on urine culture sensitivity report. After 16 h of hospitalization patient developed tremors, sweating and was found to have blood glucose level of 58 mg/dl. He was administered 10% dextrose intravenously, which relieved his symptoms. The patient had repeated episodes of hypoglycemia for subsequent 3 days (blood glucose levels 77, 44, 54 mg/dl) despite regular administration of intravenous 10% dextrose. Moxifloxacin was discontinued after 3 days, after it was suspected to cause the hypoglycemia. After stopping moxifloxacin, his blood sugar levels increased after 24 h and he developed hyperglycemia (blood sugars-273, 324, 298 mg/dl) and required insulin treatment. The patient was discharged on recovery after 10 days of hospitalization. At 1 month follow-up, his liver function tests and kidney function tests were normal.

    "question": "The patient was a 45-year-old male with a past medical history of intermittent asthma, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department (ED) via ambulance status post fall in the context of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. Initially in the ED the patient was urinating on the floor, attempting to fight staff members, and uncooperative with examination. Intravenous haloperidol 5 mg and midazolam 4 mg were administered for agitation, after which the patient was able to tolerate medical evaluation and management. Additional history was limited at this time given the patient\u2019s intoxicated state. The patient was unable to participate in a formal review of systems given his altered mental status (AMS). Initial vital signs were blood pressure 146/83 mm Hg, pulse 104 beats per minute, temperature 98.4 \u00b0F, respiratory rate 18 breath per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. Physical examination was grossly normal aside from a 3 cm stellate forehead laceration. Apart from a leukocytosis of 15 K/mm3, complete blood count, and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal limits. Pertinent normal laboratory test results included a sodium of 140 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen of 15, and a creatinine of 0.87 mg/dL. Urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines and PCP. Urinalysis was positive for only bacteria and nitrites along with 6 to 9 epithelial cells per high-power field suggesting possible contamination. Urine cultures were not obtained. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated left zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures without acute intracranial pathology. CT imaging of the patient\u2019s cervical spine did not demonstrate any acute pathology. While in the ED, the patient\u2019s forehead laceration was sutured. The patient was admitted to an inpatient medicine unit for further management of his AMS and facial fracture.\nOn admission, the patient was somnolent, oriented only to self, and unable to engage with the admission assessment. An extensive AMS workup was completed, which included ammonia, vitamin B12 and folate levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone, blood cultures, C-reactive protein, repeat comprehensive metabolic panel/complete blood count, syphilis screen, and repeat head CT. Aside from a mildly elevated C-reactive protein of 2.6 mg/dL and leukocytosis of 14.2 K/mm3 the remainder of the patient\u2019s laboratory test results was within normal limits. Specific laboratory tests of interest pertinent to a delirium workup returned within normal limits as follows: ammonia 15 \u00b5mol/L, thyroid-stimulating hormone 0.4, vitamin B12 576 pg/mL, and folate 22.9 ng/mL. The differential diagnosis for the patient\u2019s AMS remained wide, so he was placed on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol protocol and started on intravenous thiamine as a history of alcohol use could not be ruled out. The patient was also given a 3-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone considering equivocal urinalysis findings. Plastic surgery was consulted and recommended nonemergent elective repair of the facial fractures, but treatment was deferred as the patient remained altered and could not consent to the procedure.\nPer family collateral, the patient worked part-time as a mechanic, lived alone, performed all activities of daily living independently, and did not have any history of neurologic or psychiatric disease. Family was unable to provide any additional information regarding the patient\u2019s substance use. The patient did not receive any additional lorazepam per Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol protocol or for vital sign abnormalities consistent with alcohol withdrawal. Aside from his tachycardia on initial presentation in the ED, the patient did not demonstrate tachycardia after admission to the inpatient medicine unit. On the third hospital day, the patient\u2019s AMS persisted, and neurology was consulted and evaluated the patient for additional causes of encephalopathy.\nOn the consulting neurologist\u2019s initial examination, the patient remained lethargic, oriented only to self, unable to follow complex commands, and hypophonic with increased speech latency. No focal cranial nerve deficit was appreciated; however, the patient exhibited hypertonicity with significant oppositional paratonias in all 4 extremities along with bilaterally upgoing plantar reflexes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) were ordered per neurology recommendations. EEG did not demonstrate epileptiform activity or generalized slowing. However, MRI revealed a restricted diffusion/focal hyperintensity within the splenium of the corpus callosum on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, respectively. MRI findings on FLAIR, DWI, and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) are highlighted in . In consideration of the patient\u2019s recent exposure to neuroleptics, persistent encephalopathy, and significant oppositional paratonias, the possibility of an atypical variant of NMS contributing to the patient\u2019s delirium was likely. Despite the likelihood of atypical NMS, in considering the wide differential diagnosis of callosal lesions the probability of the MRI lesion representing a new infarct remained. Therefore, the patient was placed on standing aspirin 325 mg along with atorvastatin 40 mg daily. CT angiography of the head and neck was completed and was unremarkable. The patient was also started on standing benztropine 1 mg twice daily for atypical NMS. Of note, lorazepam was not used as there was concern for additional central nervous system depression in an already somnolent and delirious patient.\nBy the seventh hospital day, the patient became more alert, had improved orientation, was able to complete 2 step commands with prompting, and had reduced cogwheeling on examination. Additionally, the patient\u2019s leukocytosis had down-trended to 13.2 K/mm3. The scheduled benztropine was also discontinued. The patient did not require any physical restraints or tranquilizers for agitation after admission. The patient\u2019s MRI was repeated 11 days after initial imaging, which redemonstrated the corpus callosum splenium hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and without restricted diffusion on DWI. The patient was instructed to repeat imaging as an outpatient to confirm the diagnosis of subacute callosal infarct versus transient splenial lesion of another etiology. The patient was recommended to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility to further manage his physical deconditioning and was subsequently lost to follow-up.

    "question": "A 58-year-old Thai female patient with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus was infected with HIV 1.5 years ago. She had been taking antiretroviral drugs including tenofovir, emtricitabine, and boosted darunavir thereafter and achieved virological control after 6 months of therapy. Her CD4-positive T-lymphocyte count was 532/mm3 (40%). Her other medications were amlodipine 5 mg/day, enalapril 10 mg/day, fenofibrate 300 mg/day, and metformin 500 mg/day. She gradually developed anorexia, nausea, and fatigue over two weeks' duration. She also noticed a decrease in her daily urine volume and new-onset nocturia together with swelling in both of her legs particularly in the evening. She reported no fever, rash, or joint pain. She denied taking over-the-counter medication or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. On examination, she was alert and had normal vital signs except for mild hypertension (body temperature 37.0\u00b0C, pulse rate 70/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and blood pressure 140/70 mmHg). She also had mildly pale conjunctivae and pitting edema in both of her legs. Laboratory tests showed severe azotemia (BUN 21.4 mmol/L, Cr 1,370 \u00b5mol/L) compared to baselines labs 1 month earlier (Cr 124 \u00b5mol/L). She also had hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated muscle enzyme (sodium 127 mEq/L, potassium 5.5 mEq/L, chloride 94 mEq/L, bicarbonate 10 mEq/L, and creatine phosphokinase 1,904 U/L; normal value 22\u2013165 U/L). Urinalysis revealed isosthenuria, albuminuria, leukocyturia, and microhematuria without dysmorphic RBC (specific gravity 1.010, proteinuria 2+, glucose negative, WBC 3\u20135/hpf, and RBC 20\u201330/hpf). Renal ultrasonography demonstrated normal size but mildly increased parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys without hydroureter or hydronephrosis. AKI was diagnosed. Differential diagnoses of AKI included tenofovir-induced ATN, HIV-associated nephropathy/immune complex glomerulonephritis, and rhabdomyolysis.\nRRT was initiated soon after admission due to uremia and volume overload. After successful insertion of flexible double-cuff PD catheter, automated PD (Homechoice cycler; Baxter) using total dialysate (Dianeal; Baxter) volume of 10 L was started (fill volume of 2 L, five cycles, therapy time 12 hours) on the first day of admission resulting in adequate control of fluid, electrolytes, and acid-base balance. The doses of PD by total weekly Kt/V and total weekly CCr were 3.63 and 91.94 L/week, respectively. Renal biopsy was later performed revealing evidence of acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis (AIN) and ATN without evidence of glomerular or vascular injury. Antiretroviral drugs-induced ATN/AIN was diagnosed. The attending physician then switched antiretroviral regimen to stavudine/lamivudine/boosted darunavir regimen. During fourth week of admission, her urine volume had increased to 0.8\u20131.0 L per day but the measured renal CCr was still low (6.62 mL/min/1.73 m2). She was discharged from the hospital anyway and was prescribed to continue automated PD during night time at home (night intermittent PD; NIPD) at a similar dose (fill volume of 2 L, five cycles, therapy time 12 hours). Eventually, PD was successfully discontinued 9 months after the onset of AKI in August 2014. At that time, her serum Cr was 159 \u00b5mol/L, and measured renal CCr was stable at 17.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 with daily urine volume of 2,480 mL. Afterwards, she remained in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 with stable renal function for another whole year.

    "question": "A 55-year-old previously healthy man from the western province of Sri Lanka was admitted to Colombo South Teaching Hospital (CSTH) 18 h after an HNV bite. He was initially managed in a peripheral hospital and later transferred as he was anuric for 8 h. He also had vomiting and loose stools. Fang marks were seen on the fifth left toe with pain, minimal swelling and two blisters on the dorsum of the foot. The killed snake was identified by the medical officer as an HNV. He was conscious and rational with a pulse rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure 150/100 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 98%. There was no bleeding tendency or neurological manifestations. Bedside whole blood clotting time was less than 20 min on admission to the peripheral hospital and at 18 h when seen at the CSTH. Polyvalent antivenom was not given as it is ineffective in neutralizing HNV toxicity and carry a high risk of side effects.\nInitial investigations revealed, haemoglobin 13.2 g/dl, white cells 13.2 \u00d7 109/L, platelets 68 \u00d7 109/L, serum sodium 143 mmol/L, serum potassium 4.2 mmol/L and serum creatinine 3.2 mg/dl. On the 2nd day, haematological investigations revealed, haemoglobin 10.5 g/dl, white blood cells 14.1 \u00d7 109/L and platelets 58 \u00d7 109/L, whole blood clotting time > 20 min, PT/INR 1.7 (reference range: < 1.1) and APTT 48 s (30\u201340s). Total bilirubin 62.14 \u03bcmol/L (5\u201321) with direct bilirubin 10.08 \u03bcmol/L (< 3.4), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 171 U/L (10\u201340), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 808 U/L (10\u201335), Creatine kinase (CK) 750 U/L (15\u2013105), serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 2370 U/L (230\u2013460) and serum creatinine was 409 \u03bcmol/L (70\u2013120). Blood picture revealed fragmented red cells and thrombocytopenia suggestive of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA). In view of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), he was transfused with fresh frozen plasma with the improvement of INR and APTT. The patient was commenced on haemodialysis due to acute kidney injury (AKI).\nOn the 3rd day, he became tachypneic with de-saturation and blood gases revealed PH 7.21, PCO2 45 mmHg, PO2 31 mmHg HCO3 12.4 mEq/L. He was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation. Bleeding through the endotracheal tube was noted but there was no bleeding from elsewhere. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral alveolar shadowing suggestive of pulmonary haemorrhages (Fig. ). At this time his platelet count was 56 \u00d7 109/L, INR 1.1, APTT 40 s, thrombo-elastometry showed only a deficiency of platelets. Due to the life-threatening nature of the situation, he was commenced on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g pulse therapy daily along with FFP and platelet transfusions. There was a rapid improvement of hypoxia with the resolution of chest x-ray changes during the next 48 h. We discontinued steroid therapy after 3 days as there was no further bleeding and chest x-ray changes were resolving (Fig. ).\nBecause of, persistent TMA as evidenced by a further drop in haemoglobin (8 mg/dl) and platelets (28 \u00d7 109/L) plasmapheresis was commenced and continued for 6 cycles. Despite the effective treatment of TMA, the patient went on to develop dry gangrene of toes on both feet (Fig. ). Renal function did not improve and required long term maintenance haemodialysis. He underwent renal transplantation 11 months after the incident due to end-stage renal disease.

He had a history of consumption of anabolic steroids (dexona + dianabol [methandrostenolone] combination) for general body development for a duration of 3 months.\nLaboratory studies revealed a serum creatinine of 2.27 mg/dl, urine protein to creatinine ratio of 6, proteinuria of 4.7 g in 24 h. Urine microscopy showed 10-12 white blood cells and 5-40 red blood cells per high power field. His liver function tests (LFT) were normal. There was no jaundice or evidence of cholestasis. Tests for antibodies to HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. There was no biochemical evidence of a TMA. Ultrasound examination of both kidneys revealed Grade II renal parenchymal changes.\nThe renal biopsy showed global glomerulosclerosis in four of the 15 glomeruli, with the remaining showing mesangial and endocapillary cell proliferation with paramesangial capillary wall thickening. The extra glomerular compartment showed interstitial fibrosis amounting to 20%, aggregates of mononuclear inflammatory cells, tubular atrophy, microcystic dilatation of tubules with hyaline casts and necrotic cells in nonatrophic tubular lumina [].\nThe immunofluorescence (IF) done on two glomeruli revealed arborizing mesangial deposits of IgA (3+), IgG (2+ to 3+) and C3 (2+ to 3+) with extension into the paramesangial capillary walls. There was no staining for IgM, C1q or C4. Electron microscopic examination of seven glomeruli showed abundant paramesangial electron-dense deposits, focally extending subendothelially into peripheral capillary loops. Segmental thinning and splitting of glomerular basement membranes (GBMs) were present, suggestive of primary IgAN. One glomerulus showed segmental [Figures and ] and another showed global collapse with corrugated GBMs and pseudocrescent formation [Figures \u2013], features consistent with CG. Foot process effacement was extensive. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions were absent, in keeping with the patient's negative serology for HIV and other viral infections. There was no evidence of TMA.\nThe final diagnosis was CG associated with IgAN. The patient was treated with oral prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil with therapeutic drug level monitoring and strongly recommended to abstain from further use of body-building drugs.

    "question": "A 70-year-old man was referred to our institution because of abdominal distention and vomiting that started 2 days prior to admission. The patient was undergoing hemodialysis for chronic nephritis, and his past history included hypertension, chronic heart failure, and arterial sclerosis. He was never a smoker and had no history of abdominal surgery or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Upon hospitalization, the patient's blood pressure was 104/57 mm Hg, heart rate was 78 beats/min, and body temperature was 36.5\u00b0C. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness and swelling in the lower abdomen; the bowel sounds were enhanced. No purpura was found, which is characteristic of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura.\nA blood test performed on admission revealed mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL), hypoalbuminemia (2.6 g/dL), mildly elevated C-reactive protein (3.24 mg/dL), and elevated serum creatinine (5.24 mg/dL) levels. The stool culture test results were negative. Tuberculosis and anisakiasis were ruled out by interferon-gamma releasing assays and anisakis antibody tests, respectively.\nAbdominal radiography in the standing position revealed dilatation of the small intestine and air-fluid levels in the intestine (shown in Fig. ); plain computed tomography (CT) showed a stenotic site with wall thickening and dilatation of the small intestine on the oral side from the stenosis (shown in Fig. ). After admission, we inserted an ileus tube to ameliorate the elevated intraluminal pressure. Contrast medium from the tube showed a stricture at the end of the ileum (shown in Fig. ). We conducted TUS using Sonazoid TM and elastography techniques, which demonstrated a thickened wall and unclear stratification of the intestinal wall in the lower right abdomen (shown in Fig. ). The length of stricture was 70 mm, and the minimum lumen diameter was 5 mm. The small intestine on the oral side of the lesion was markedly dilated. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed sufficient mucosal blood flow in the stenotic lesion (Fig. ). Ultrasound elastography revealed lower elasticity of the intestinal lesion site than the elasticity of other intact parts of the small intestine that did not show wall thickening or stenosis (strain ratio [local deformation ratio under slight pressure]: 2.52) (Fig. ). Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with IE. Conservative therapies including fasting and total parenteral nutrition were initiated after the diagnosis; however, the patient's condition did not improve.\nSurgery was performed, and the stenotic lesion was surgically resected. Macroscopic findings of the resected ileum demonstrated circumferential ulceration and stricture. Microscopic findings demonstrated penetration of the surrounding tissue and infiltration of inflammatory cells mainly in the mucosal layer. The venules in the submucosal layer were occluded by hyalinization (shown in Fig. ). Two days after the operation, the patient started oral intake without the recurrence of IE and was discharged from our hospital 1 month later.

The patient endorsed fatigue, night sweats, lightheadedness, nausea, right flank pain with radiation to the right lower quadrant, urinary frequency, diffuse bone pain, constipation for the past 1 month, and weight loss of about 15 lb over the past 6 months. The patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or dysuria. Physical exam was benign except for severe tenderness to palpation over the buttocks and hips.\nLaboratories on admission were significant for calcium 15.9 mg/dL (reference range: 8.6-10.2 mg/dL), creatinine 1.33 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1.20 mg/dL), 1-25 dihydroxyvitamin D 116.0 pg/mL (reference range: 19.9-79.3), and 25 hydroxyvitamin D 21.0 ng/mL (reference range: >30 ng/mL). Parathyroid hormone was low (15.3 pg/mL, reference range: 15.0-65.0), and alkaline phosphatase was within normal limits. Of note, ACE was found to be elevated to 139 U/L (reference range: 14-82 U/L).\nThe patient was hydrated and treated with calcitonin, decreasing her calcium to 11.3 mg/dL and her creatinine to 0.98 mg/dL.

No other abnormalities were found.\nLaboratory tests showed an elevated urea (50 mg/dl), creatinine (1.7 mg/dl), sodium (153 mmol/L), and leukocytosis of 13000 per mm3 with a shift to left (75% neutrophil, 20% lymphocyte, and 5% mixed cells), a low hemoglobin of 10.3 mg/dl with a mild hypochromic microcytic smear; evaluation for hemolysis was negative. Other metabolic evaluations including glucose were normal. Serum drug screening revealed a positive level for opiates. The brain computerized tomography (CT) scan, electroencephalography (EEG), and his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were normal. As we could not rule out herpetic encephalitis with these data, he was commenced on intravenous acyclovir 750 mg every 12 hours and subcutaneously methadone 5 mg every 12 hours to control opioid withdrawal syndrome as well as providing electrolyte correction. After two days, his consciousness had not changed. Repeated evaluation of CNS, including brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CSF analysis, showed normal results.\nTo further the evaluation of his abdominal pain, the abdominal ultrasound and CT scan were requested which revealed a coarse echo of the liver and a diameter of the portal vein of 13 mm. The upper and lower endoscopy showed gastritis and internal hemorrhoid. The Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was normal. On the third day of admission, he had experienced a tonic-clonic seizure. EEG showed evidence of encephalopathy, but his brain CT scan remained normal. On the fourth day of admission, his gastric secretion changed to coffee-ground appearance. Finally, he had a cardio-pulmonary arrest and passed away. After his death, we received a negative result of his CSF herpes virus (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and his serum lead level showed 98 \u00b5g/dl.

    "question": "A 78-year-old man underwent open surgical repair of Crawford type III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm because its maximal diameter increased from 49 to 60 mm during 2 years of follow-up (). He had no major associated illness except for chronic renal dysfunction, with a serum creatinine concentration of 2.5 mg/dL. Under general anesthesia, the thoracoabdominal aorta was replaced via a left thoracoabdominal incision through the seventh intercostal space. Left femorofemoral partial cardiopulmonary bypass was performed for distal aortic perfusion, and the visceral branches were selectively perfused at the flow rate of 100 mL/min for each branch. As the most distal segment of the thoracic aorta had not experienced aneurysmal changes, the thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta were separately replaced with 2 grafts: a 26-mm tube graft (Gelweave; Vascutek, Inchinnan, UK) for the thoracic aorta and a 26-mm 4-branch graft (Gelweave Coselli, Vascutek) for the abdominal aorta (). The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 63 minutes and the entire operation took 280 minutes.\nThe patient quickly regained consciousness without any neurological deficits and could be extubated at 10 hours after the operation. However, oliguric renal failure developed, necessitating continuous renal replacement therapy, which was changed to intermittent hemodialysis starting on postoperative day (POD) 6. After being transferred to the general ward on POD 7, he had to remain in the hospital because of general weakness and poor oral intake. Postoperative computed tomographic (CT) imaging, which is usually taken before POD 7 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, was deferred for fear of aggravating the patient\u2019s renal dysfunction, which could be reversible. An arteriovenous fistula for dialysis access was made at the left forearm on day 29.\nOn POD 49, the patient developed fever and abdominal pain. After noticing rapidly progressing abdominal distension, CT angiography was immediately performed, and revealed a large amount of retroperitoneal hematoma around the prosthetic graft. Extravasation of the contrast agent was noted (). The branch graft connected to the left renal artery was not visualized. With those findings, the most probable diagnosis was considered to be dehiscence of the left renal artery graft.\nThe patient was directly transferred to the operating room for exploration. In contrast to our interpretation of the CT images, a 2-mm-long linear tear was found at the prosthetic graft at a location in direct contact with a sharp bony spur protruding from the second lumbar vertebral body (). After repairing the tear with a pledget-buttressed 4-0 polypropylene suture in a horizontal mattress manner, a retroperitoneal fat flap was interposed between the graft and the bony spur. The patient stayed in the intensive care unit for 3 more days and then remained hospitalized for 4 months. There was no further event during 2 years of subsequent follow-up. On a retrospective review of the CT images, we confirmed the presence of the vertebral bony spur, which had not drawn any attention from the surgeons and radiologists before the second operation ().\nInformed consent was acquired from the patient.

    "question": "A 68-year-old non-smoking Caucasian man initially transferred from a different hospital for evaluation of a brain lesion found on imaging. The patient has a medical history pertinent to BPH, and his family history was relevant for a father with colon cancer.\nSix months earlier, his primary care physician (PCP) evaluated him for worsening urinary symptoms and subsequently referred him to a urologist. Upon further evaluation, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was normal at 3 ng/mL, and his digital rectal examination was normal, for which a cystoscopy with prostate GreenLight\u2122 (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) enucleation was performed for BPH diagnosis. Five months later and one month before this admission, he discerned progressive worsening of double vision. His PCP examined and referred him to an ophthalmologist, who diagnosed him with third cranial (oculomotor) and sixth cranial (abducens) nerve palsy, which was subsequently confirmed by a neurologist.\nSubsequently, the patient was admitted to the other hospital, and upon admission, he was found to have an acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia. Laboratory studies showed white blood cells of 27 x 10^3/\u00b5L, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 201 K/\u00b5L. His chemistry was pertinent for sodium of 134 mmol/L, potassium of 6.5 mmol/L, chloride of 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate level of 10 mmol/L, a glucose of 159 mg/dL, creatinine of 13 mg/dL, uric acid of 19.6 \u00b5mol/L, chromogranin A of 656 \u00b5g/L, and PSA of 22.67 ng/mL. He received hemodialysis and underwent bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy, after which his AKI resolved. An abdominal CT scan showed findings consistent with diffuse metastatic disease to the lungs, liver, and peritoneum, and brain MRI showed brain lesions. Therefore, he was, subsequently, transferred to our hospital for further care.\nUpon evaluation in our hospital, imaging showed findings consistent with earlier recognized lesions at the other hospital (Figures -). The patient was, therefore, seen by a multidisciplinary team of a neurosurgeon, an ophthalmologist, a medical oncologist, and a radiation oncologist. Biopsies of a perirectal mass showed a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor. The oncologist who saw him diagnosed him with metastatic SCC of the lung; therefore, he was started on one cycle of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy during his hospitalization, which he tolerated well and was discharged home.\nA senior oncologist saw the patient, reviewed all his radiographic images, and questioned the initial diagnosis of lung SCC based on the patient\u2019s clinical presentation of urinary obstruction, hydronephrosis, and AKI. Hence, the original tumor location speculated to be consistent with a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor/SCC originating from the urinary tract. The senior oncologist, therefore, advised cystoscopy for prostate biopsy, which was declined by consulting urologist because the \u201cprostate exam was normal.\u201d Consequently, the senior oncologist sent the patient to a second urologist who performed cystoscopy and informed the patient that everything was normal. The senior oncologist had a thorough discussion to explain the necessity of a meticulous endoscopic urethral examination and prostate biopsy. Subsequently, the patient took the senior oncologist\u2019s advice, went back to the urologist, and underwent a repeat diagnostic cystoscopy. This time, biopsies of the urethra were taken and confirmed a high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. \n \nThe tissue specimen from this case was compared to the patient\u2019s previous perirectal mass biopsy and was found to have similar features. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were negative for CK7, CK20, PSA, and prostate-specific acid phosphatase. Scattered individual cells were positive for nuclear NKX 3.1 and cytoplasmic CK5. Moreover, there was diffuse variable positivity for nuclear p63 with greater than 80% of nuclei were positive for p53 and diffuse strong positivity for CD56, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and synaptophysin (Figure ).\nBased on the clinical history of disease distribution, the pathologist considered the neoplasm to be likely of either prostate or urinary bladder origin. Subsequently, the senior oncologist reviewed the urethral biopsy, remained suspecting the primary site of cancer to be originating from the prostate. Therefore, he advised for prostate biopsy. Finally, the patient underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, which confirmed that all 12 cores were positive for prostate SCC (Figure ). The pathology findings confirmed the senior oncologist\u2019s initial surmise that the metastatic cancer origin was from the genitourinary tract, likely involving prostate extending into the urethra.

    "question": "A 63-year-old male with history of alcoholic cirrhosis, without any significant valve disorder, and without history of drug abuse (MELD score of 13 as of a month ago) presented to the hospital with abdominal pain for the past 3 weeks. He had no prior history of ascites and never underwent a paracentesis. He had multiple admissions in the past for alcohol withdrawal with the most recent hospitalization 3 weeks ago. On examination, he was cachectic, icteric, and had a holosystolic murmur which was heard best at the apex with radiation to the axilla. His abdomen was diffusely tender and distended. There were erythematous, purpuric macules, and papules scattered diffusely on hands, legs, and feet bilaterally ().\nAdmission labs were white blood cell count of 16.8 k/uL, hemoglobin of 10 g/dl, platelets of 292 k/uL, prothrombin time 27.8 s, sodium of 125 mEq/L, potassium of 4.8 mmol/L, urea of 54 mg/dL, creatinine 3.3 mg/dL, bilirubin 9.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 24 U/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) of 76 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 93 U/L, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) 829 U/L, total protein of 7.4 g/dL, albumin of 2.6 g/dL, and INR of 2.3. One month ago, labs were essentially normal, except for a bilirubin of 4.4 mg/dL, and hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL. His current MELD score was 38 points. Paracentesis was performed on the ascitic fluid which showed a cell count of 2000 cells/mm3 with neutrophilic predominance with polymorphonuclear cell count PMN of 700 cells/mm3. The admission lab values are mentioned in .\nPatient was empirically started on Piperacillin and Tazobactam. Patient blood culture revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters and 750 mg of Vancomycin was added 2 days later (given high suspicion of healthcare-associated infection which is defined as infections that develop in less than 48 h after admission or previous exposure to healthcare setting in the preceding 90\u2013180 days).\n Final culture was positive for MSSA. Paracentesis fluid culture revealed MSSA as well. Echocardiogram showed vegetation on the mitral valve 17 mm \u00d7 4 mm (). Antibiotics were changed to cefazolin. The patient was not a candidate for surgery in spite of embolic events due to a high Mayo surgical risk of 40% mortality within 7 days. His kidney function continued to deteriorate. Urine studies showed UNa of 79 mEq/L, U creatinine of 50.2 mg/dL, and FENa of 4.1%. Patient had a daily electrocardiography (EKG) which did not show an AV block. No persistent fever or bacteremia was noted. He had hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) for which he was initially started on octreotide, midodrine, albumin without response, and eventually needed hemodialysis. He was discharged to rehab with long-term intravenous antibiotics for a total of 6 weeks. Patient\u2019s repeat echocardiogram showed improvement in valve function with clearance of vegetation (). Even with the clearance of infection, patient\u2019s clinical course continued to deteriorate with multiple admissions for refractory symptomatic ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, recurrent pleural effusion, acute liver failure and encephalopathy. He was not a candidate for transplantation due to active alcohol abuse within last 6 months. He underwent placement of palliative peritoneal drainage catheter and transferred to tertiary care for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The improved survival seen in patients with HRS from TIPS made us refer him for the same.\n Other factor affecting success from TIPS is pre-TIPS bilirubin which was 2.6 mg/dL in his case.

    "question": "A 73-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) in June 2008 with a history of collapse without loss of consciousness while mobilizing to the toilet in the early hours of the morning. This occurred on the background of a 6 day history of general unwellness. He was conscious and orientated on arrival but was slightly drowsy. Other than clinical features of dehydration and mild central abdominal adiposity with a waist: hip ratio of 1.04, there were no other significant clinical signs. His random plasma glucose (RPG) on arrival was 59.1 mmol/L. His height was 1.76 meters (m) and weight was 90 kilograms (kg) making the body mass index (BMI) 29.0 kg/m2. The patient was previously fit and well without any known co-morbidities. He was on no regular medication. There was no family history of diabetes or other significant conditions. He was a non-smoker and consumed no alcohol. He works as a farm equipment evaluator. There was no history of specific weight loss over the preceding months. His general practitioner (GP) had performed a fasting plasma glucose test on him in February 2008 which showed a value of 6.4 mmol/L. This was repeated within 2 weeks and the repeated value was 6.1 mmol/L. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was also done and was 6.3%. Subsequent 75 gram (g) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) produced a value of 15.3 mmol/L, 14.1 mmol/L and 7.6 mmol/L 30 minutes, 1-hour and 2-hours post glucose load respectively. He was managed with dietary modification and exercise.\nHis sodium (Na) was 150 mmol/L, potassium (K) 4.6 mmol/L, urea 26.1 mmol/L and creatinine (Cr) 237 micromol/L. Calculated osmolality was 394.4 mOsm/kg. Arterial blood gas sampling (ABG) showed a pH of 7.36, pCO2 4.9 kPa, pO2 11.0 kPa, bicarbonate 20 mmol/L and BE -1 mmol/L. Lactate was mildly elevated at 1.4 mmol/L. \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (\u03b2-OHB) was slightly elevated at 3.67 mmol/L. Repeat HBA1c was 8.1%. Besides a small amount of ketones and glycosuria, urine testing revealed nil else of concern. Full septic screen was done; white cell count (WCC) and differential showed mildly raised WCC at 12.5 \u00d7 109 and neutrophils at 10.9 \u00d7 109 with the rest of differential count being normal, CRP was 4, urine microscopy, culture and sensitivity was normal and chest radiograph was normal. Thyroid function was normal. Lipid profile was also normal.\nThe patient was diagnosed with T2DM based on his presentation, age and absence of anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 65 (Anti-GAD 65), Insulinoma Antigen-2 (IA-2) and Islet Cell (ICA) antibodies. His acute presentation was consistent with hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) and acute renal failure secondary to dehydration. He was treated with intravenous insulin and intensively rehydrated with close attention to electrolyte balance. He improved considerably and renal function normalized. He was started on Metformin 500 mg twice daily (BID) increasing to 1 g BD and Penmix 30 subcutaneous insulin at a dose of 12 units BD increasing to 30 units BD. 5 days after the acute event, a 1 mg intravenous (IV) glucagon stimulation test was done at 9.00 am with blood samples for glucose and C-peptide taken at baseline, 5, 10 and 15 minutes.\nPatient had been fasted for 15 hours overnight and medications were withheld until after the test. The glucose values were 6.3 mmol/L, 15.1 mmol/L, 16.3 mmol/L and 16.6 mmol/L at baseline, 5, 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Corresponding C-peptide values were 0.21 nmol/L, 0.42 nmol/L, 0.47 nmol/L and 0.51 nmol/L respectively. He was finally discharged after 7 days of hospital care with clinic follow up in 2 months.

On admission, he presented jaundice, fever (38 \u00b0C), heart rate of 98 bpm and blood pressure 120 x 70 mmHg. On an initial laboratory workup drew attention the total bilirubin of 13.6 mg/dL (reference range [RR], 0.2-1.4 mg/dL) with direct bilirubin of 6.11 mg/dL (RR; 0.0-0.3) and indirect bilirubin of 7.55 mg/dL, RR; 0.2-1.2 mg/dL), aspartate transaminase [AST] of 10,740 UI/L (RR; 15-37 UI/L) and alanine transaminase [ALT] of 3,120 UI/L (RR; 30-65 UI/L); renal failure (serum creatinine level of 3.21 mg/dL, [RR; 0.7-1.2 mg/dL] and urea of 77 mg/dL, [RR; 0.2-1.4 mg/dL]) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 33,000/mm3, [RR; 13-400x103/mm3]). On the day 7 after admission, a positive molecular test for yellow fever was available. The patient was referred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of an Infectious Disease Referral Hospital because of the worsening clinical status characterized by mental confusion, which progressed to hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, respiratory failure, and bleeding at the puncture sites. An antimicrobial regimen was empirically started with piperacillin/tazobactam, and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (800 mL), lactulose and glycerin enema were administered. The abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of moderate ascites and signs of nephropathy, but the absence of bile ducts\u2019 dilation and signs of chronic fibrosing liver disease. As the clinical course demanded, the patient was started on hemodialysis. Although no microorganism was isolated on cultures, the antibiotics were also empirically changed for meropenem, vancomycin, and polymyxin B due to the suspicion of peritonitis, ascending leukocytosis and severe hypotension requiring vasoactive drugs administration.

    "question": "An 80-year-old female with no past surgical history was brought into the Emergency Department (ED) of a public teaching hospital with concern for altered mental status. She had a past medical history of atrial fibrillation (for which she was taking apixaban), two prior cerebrovascular accidents, hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and Stage 3 chronic kidney disease with a baseline serum creatinine of 1.3\u20131.5\u202fmg/dL.\nUpon evaluation, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Score of 8 (E(2)V(2)M(4)) and was unable to provide any history. Initial vitals showed a temperature of 97.8\u202f\u00b0F, heart rate of 73\u202fbeats/min, blood pressure of 118/65, respiratory rate of 18\u202fbreaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, her abdomen was distended and diffusely tender to palpation. Laboratory results showed an elevated serum creatinine of 5.0\u202fmg/dL consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI). Serum electrolytes, white blood cell count, serum lactate, and coagulation tests were within normal limits. The patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast, which showed a large dilated loop of proximal jejunum with evidence of mesenteric twist concerning for a closed loop SBO ().\nGiven the patient\u2019s age and medical comorbidities, her estimated American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program intraoperative mortality risk was 19%, and the risk of serious complications was 35% []. However, due to the acute decline in mental status, AKI, and concerning abdominal exam, emergent surgical intervention was recommended to the next of kin. After obtaining consent, we proceeded with an exploratory laparotomy.\nAfter intravenous fluid resuscitation and perioperative antibiotics, the patient underwent general anesthesia and intubation. Upon entering the abdomen, we noted several decompressed loops of small bowel, as well as a dilated loop of jejunum densely adherent to the mesentery of the SMA and transverse colon. We also noted twisting of the mesentery and numerous adhesions of the small bowel to the mesentery, retroperitoneum, and surrounding structures. During our lysis of adhesions, we noted a large mesenteric defect through which a loop of jejunum had become trapped, causing the closed loop SBO. Moreover, the cecum was visualized in the right upper quadrant instead of its usual anatomical location in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (A). It became apparent that the adhesions were in fact Ladd bands (A), and that our patient had an intestinal malrotation. After completely lysing the Ladd bands, we then proceeded with a Ladd procedure for malrotation. We first detorsed the mesentery through counterclockwise rotation. The segment of jejunum involved in the internal hernia appeared viable, so no bowel resection was performed. We then mobilized and rotated the cecum and the ascending and transverse colon towards the left, also performing an appendectomy. After straightening out and relocating the duodenum to the right hemiabdomen, the final position of abdominal contents was consistent with that seen after a completed Ladd procedure (B).\nThe patient\u2019s postoperative course was accompanied by resolution of AKI but complicated by delirium and prolonged ileus. Initial high-volume bilious output from her nasogastric tube prompted a CT scan that showed no evidence of SBO, and confirmed the new position of the cecum on the left (). The patient was discharged following clinical improvement and ability to tolerate a diet. She was seen in clinic two weeks later and reported feeling well, with no obstructive symptoms.

    "question": "A 60-year-old female suffering from frontal lobe epilepsy was presented to our hospital with a mental obtundation.\nWe have treated the patient for a period of 5 years and have registered an electroencephalogram (EEG) with ictal fast activity in the right frontocentral area. A brain MRI showed a T2 high, T1 low signal intensity of a single lesion without enhancement in the right anterior basal frontal lobe white matter (). She used to have partial seizures with a secondary generalization, and she has been on 1,200 mg/day VPA for the last 4 years. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSz) were well controlled, but partial seizures of left head version following left arm clonus occurred one to two times per several months. We added LEV to VPA and increased the daily dosage of LEV to 1,000 mg/day. Her partial motor seizures ceased and her EEG showed normal findings ().\nEight months later, mental obtundation developed insidiously. The neurologic findings showed no ataxia or nystagmus, and routine hematological and biochemical laboratories presented a normal complete blood count (WBC 6,600/mm3, Hb 13.4 g/dL, platelet 168,000/mm), electrolyte (Na 138 mmol/L, K 4.1 mmol/L), renal (BUN 11.1 mg/dL, Creatinine 0.72 mg/dL), and thyroid function test (free T4 1.230 ng/dL, TSH 0.779 uIU/mL). Her creatinine clearance was of 75.6 mL/min. However, her liver function test showed a mild impairment (aspartate aminotransferase 46 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 44 IU/L, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 656 IU/L), and the serum ammonia level was high (154 umol/L, normal: 12 to 47 umol/L). An abdomen computed tomography (CT) with a contrast enhancement showed no remarkable finding, except for a 0.6 cm-sized liver cyst. The blood concentrations of VPA was of 82.4 ug/mL (therapeutic range: 50\u2013100 ug/mL). The EEG presented an intermittent generalized delta slowing (). We suspected the possibility of side effects associated with LEV because she tolerated medication with VPA for 4 years and stopped LEV. Her mental function was gradually restored, with a decrease in the blood ammonia level (56 umol/L), and the generalized slowing disappeared in a follow-up EEG (). We added carbamazepine to treat for partial seizures, and the patient was asymptomatic until the last visit in July 2014.

    "question": "A 35 year old female with SCD, presented with pedal and periorbital edema, distension of abdomen, decreased urine output and dyspnoea on exertion since 1 month. On examination, she was pale, with pulse rate of 100/minute, normal temperature, and blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg. Her abdomen was distended due to moderate ascites however there was no organomegaly/scars. Cardio-respiratory and neurological examination was unremarkable. Ultrasonography showed right kidney, 10.9 \u00d7 6.0 cm, left kidney of 11.4 \u00d7 5.8 cm, with increased echogenicity and maintained cortico-medullary differentiation. Moderate ascites was present.\nOn investigations, urine albumin was 500 mg/24 hours, microscopy showed 30\u201340 pus cells and 3\u20135 granular casts/high power field, urine culture was sterile, serum creatinine, 7.0 mg%, serum proteins, 4.5 gm/dL; serum albumin, 1.8 gm%, serum bilirubin was 0.5 mg/dL, serum alanine amino transferase was 16 units/L, random blood sugar was 87 mg/dL, serum uric acid was 7.5 mg/dL, serum sodium was 134 meq/L and serum potassium, 5.5 meq/L and positive sickling test was noted at 24 hours. Her hemoglobin was 7.1 gm/dL; total leucocyte count was 7,700/cmm with differential count showing neutrophils, 76%, lymphocytes, 20% and eosinophils and monocytes, each, 2%. Peripheral smear showed few crenated and sickled cells with mild hypochromia and anisopoikylocytosis.\nShe was dialyzed and 2 units of packed cells were transfused. Renal biopsy was performed and after paraffin embedding, 3 micrometer sections were taken and stained using Hematoxylin and eosin, Periodic Acid Schiff, Jone's silver methaneamine and Gomori's trichrome stains. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were performed using anti-human IgG, IgM, IgA, C1q, C3, albumin and fibrinogen anti-sera (DAKO, USA). Histopathology revealed one core with 13 glomeruli. All of them were moderately enlarged in size and 11 had exuberant and occasionally circumferential cellular (rarely fibrocellular) crescents occupying 70\u201390% urinary spaces, occasionally replacing capillary tufts and shrinking or pushing the capillary tufts towards vascular poles (Figure ). Capillary tufts had fairly open lumina lined by membranes with occasional reduplication, thickening/rupture. There was uniform moderate mesangial prominence. Capillaries and crescents were infiltrated by few sickle shaped, dysmorphic RBCs, platelet/fibrin thrombi. Afferent and efferent arterioles were filled with sickled RBCs. Bowman capsules were segmentally thickened and occasionally ruptured evoking periglomerular leucocytic reaction. Tubules were moderately degenerated and filled with cellular casts and rarely RBCs. Focal atrophy was also evident. Interstitium was moderately prominent for focal fibrosis and overlying focal mononuclear cellular infiltration with admixed neutrophils. Peri-tubular capillaries were dilated and filled with sickled RBCs (Figure ). At least one medium caliber and two small caliber arteries showed lumina filled with trapped dysmorphic RBCs.\nImmunofluorescence studies showed fine granular fluorescence (+2) across 60\u201380% mesangial regions and adjacent capillaries of all glomeruli on staining with anti-human C3 and (trace/+1) with anti-human IgG, C1q and fibrinogen antisera (Figure ). Subsequently she was investigated for vasculitis and lupus nephritis. Indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA revealed anti-nuclear antibodies, (normal index: <1, test: 8.5), anti-dsDNA antibodies were >200 IU/mL (normal <25 IU/mL, Orgentec, Germany). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were absent. Final diagnosis was made as SCN with DPLN, ISN/RPS class IV-G (A).\nHemoglobin variant study using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (d-10, Biorad, USA) was performed 5 days after transfusion which showed HbSA of 6.9% (Figure ).\nShe was treated with Methylprednisolone 500 mg, intravenously for 3 days and Cyclophosphamide, 500 mg intravenously immediately and dose was repeated after 21 days. Then she was switched over to oral Prednisolone, 40 mg/day. Hemodialysis was done on alternate days for 21 days. At follow-up of 2 months, she is on maintenance dialysis with urine output of less than 400 ml/day.

    "question": "A 42-year-old Saudi male from Jizan, with a comorbidity of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 6 years prior (well controlled by oral antidiabetic agents: metformin 1000 mg twice daily and gliclazide 30 mg once daily), presented with impaired renal function and hematuria. After basic laboratory investigations, kidney biopsy was performed. Histological examination with light microscope revealed a global sclerosed glomeruli, minimal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy []. A diagnosis of glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology was made and treatment with mycophenolate (1 g PO twice daily) and prednisone (20 mg PO once daily) was initiated.\nAfter 3 months, the patient presented with a 3-week history of fever, abdominal pain and fatigue. The fever was subjective, intermittent, associated with chills and rigors, especially at night, and not relieved by paracetamol. The abdominal pain was intermittent, diffuse and colicky in nature and was associated with nausea and vomiting without blood (2\u20133 times/day). During these 3 weeks, the patient's appetite decreased, owing to which he lost 7 kg in weight. In addition, the patient reported a history of animal contact (goat and sheep), ingestion of raw goat milk and swimming in the valley water. There was no history of rash, cough, hemoptysis, jaundice, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, change in urine color, arthralgia, visual disturbances, oral ulcers, genital rash, discharge or contact with tuberculosis patients.\nOn physical examination, the patient was found to be obese, sweating, not jaundiced or cyanosed. He was conscious, alert and oriented to time, place and person. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 38.6\u00b0C; pulse rate, 98 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; blood pressure, 125/85 mmHg; and oxygen saturation, 100% on room air. He was pale, with normal jugular venous pressure and no oral ulcers or thrush. Abdominal examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness and a palpable liver 4 cm below the costal margin with a 15-cm liver span. The rest of the examinations were within normal limits.\nLaboratory investigations on admission revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.65/mcL (neutrophils, 72.1%; lymphocytes, 23.2%; monocytes, 4%; and eosinophils, 0.7%). Results of other hematological examinations were as follows: hemoglobin level, 8.8 g/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 88 mm/h; platelet count, 87,000/mcL; and reticulocyte count, 1.28%. Level of ferritin was 1000 ng/mL, with a transferrin saturation of 11.22 mg/dL. Estimation of electrolytes showed sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 3.2 mEq/L and bicarbonate 25 mmol/L. Liver function tests showed that total protein was 6.1 g/dL, albumin 3.2 g/dL, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, alanine transaminase 71 IU/L, aspartate transaminase 42 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 179 IU/L and gamma-glutamyl transferase 447 IU/L. International normalized ratio was 0.8. Renal function tests showed that blood urea nitrogen was 12 mg/dL and creatinine 2.15 mg/dL. Level of lactate dehydrogenase was 732 U/L and C-reactive protein 53 mg/L. Urine analysis showed 2\u20135 WBCs/high-power field and 10\u201325 red blood cells/high-power field with no nitrites. Sickling test and direct/indirect Coombs test were negative, and the stool test result was normal.\nChest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged liver (16.2-cm liver span) and a mildly enlarged spleen (14 cm in length). Kidneys were normal in size, with a mild increase in the echogenicity of renal parenchyma, but no hydronephrosis or ascites.\nThe serological tests for viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma and Brucella were negative. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome A and B antibodies and cryoglobulin were negative. Malaria smear and blood cultures were also negative.\nThe patient's condition continued to deteriorate and he developed continuous fever of up to 40.5\u00b0C. Repeated tests after 5 days revealed the following: WBC, 1.4/mcL; hemoglobin, 6.7 g/dL; platelet, 55,000/mcL; creatinine, 3.3 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 151 mg/L; total bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase, 460 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 80 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 138 IU/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase, 651 IU/L; albumin, 2.5 g/dL; and lactate dehydrogenase, 1400 U/L.\nBone marrow aspirate showed mild hypocellular marrow with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. Bone marrow culture for Brucella was negative. Further, Leishman-Donovan bodies were not detected by light microscope. Polymerase-chain reaction test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, serological tests for dengue fever and Q fever as well as \u03b2-D-Glucan and galactomannan antigen tests were all negative. Liver biopsy showed granulomatous hepatitis with extramedullary hematopoiesis. After 1 week of admission, the patient was treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotic (meropenem intravenously, 1 g every 8 h for 6 days); however, there was no improvement.\nAdditional serological testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) releveled the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies. Based on this, the patient was started on liposomal amphotericin B course as a treatment for VL (4 mg/kg intravenous on Days 1\u20135, 10, 17, 24, 31 and 38), despite the lack of a definitive diagnosis. After 1 week, the patient improved clinically, the fever subsided, the laboratory parameters began to improve and at the end of liposomal amphotericin B course, all tests returned to normal.

He did not give a history of frothing of urine, pedal edema, hematuria or breathlessness in the past. Clinically he appeared pale and dehydrated, blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg and systemic examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed that he had normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dl), thrombocytopenia (80,000/cumm) with normal leukocyte count (7400/cumm), moderate renal failure (serum creatinine: 3 mg/dl), normal liver function tests (serum albumin: 4.92 g/dl and serum globulin: 2.4 g/dl), and normal serum electrolytes, serum calcium: 10 mg/dl, serum phosphorous: 4.7 mg/dl and elevated serum uric acid (9.5 mg/dl). Urine examination showed proteinuria 1+ on dipstick, 24 h urine protein was 8504 mg. With a high index of suspicion for a tubular proteinuria, along with a hypo proliferative marrow (reticulocyte productive index: 0.7%), the possibility of plasma cell dyscrasia was considered. Serum protein electrophoresis and urine Bence Jones protein were negative. Serum immunofixation using capillary method showed immunoglobulin G, kappa monoclonal immunoglobulin. Urine electrophoresis showed M band and serum free light chain (SFLC) assay showed a significantly elevated kappa level (4383 mg/l; normal range: 3.3-19.4) with a suppressed lambda level (4.5 mg/l; normal range: 5.7-26.3), kappa/lamba ratio was 974 (normal range in renal failure: 0.37-3.1). Skeletal survey did not show any evidence of lytic lesions. BM biopsy done showed 79% of plasma cells with plasmablastic morphology [], which were CD138 positive with kappa restriction. These atypical cells showed Ki 67% of 20-25% with very few cells positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and CD79a was negative, which suggested plasmablastic myeloma phenotype. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization on BM was negative for del13q14.3, t (11;14), t (4;14), t (14;16). Renal function deteriorated rapidly; he underwent a renal biopsy, which showed pale eosinophilic, Schiff poor fractured casts in the renal tubules [], which were kappa restricted.\nHe was started on chemotherapy, with each 21 days cycle consisting of parenteral bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2/dose on days 1, 4, 8 and 11) and oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1-4, 9-12). After the first cycle of bortezomib and dexamethasone, his renal functions started to improve. He was started on lenalidomide 25 mg/day at cycle 2 (when renal function started to improve) along with bortezomib and dexamethasone. With this intensive chemotherapy, his renal functions improved further (serum creatinine 1.77 mg/dl at 6 weeks).\nPatient was reevaluated after four cycles of chemotherapy with BM examination and free light chain assay. BM showed less than 1% of plasma cells and serum free kappa light chain was 67.69 mg/l. Serum creatinine improved to 1.4 mg/dl at 6 months and he was planned for autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT). However, due to technical delay, he was given additional two cycles of CyBorD chemotherapy (weekly cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone). Patient then underwent APBSCT with Melphalan conditioning 140 mg/m2. Post-transplant patient achieved neutrophil and platelet engraftment on day +9 and did not encounter any infections.

As per family, she did not have recent travels or exposure to sick people. They denied having domestic animals at home or any contact to the patient with pets. She was placed on mechanical ventilation and admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Admission diagnosis was systemic inflammatory response syndrome with sepsis and septic shock with multi-organic dysfunction syndrome, presumptively secondary to community-acquired pneumonia, possible biliary tract infection (ascending cholangitis), probable spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and alcoholic hepatitis. Aggressive intravenous fluids resuscitation with crystalloids along with vasopressors was initiated. Blood, urine, respiratory cultures and Legionella urine antigen were obtained. Empiric intravenous antimicrobial therapy, composed by piperacillin/tazobactam (2.25 g every 8 h) and azithromycin (500 mg every 24 h), was initiated.\nLaboratory results on admission were: A complete blood cell count of 21,000/mm3(90% neutrophils), a platelet count of 51,000/mm3, a sodium level of 127 mEq/L, a potassium level of 5.3 mEq/L, a bicarbonate level of 15 mEq/L and a creatinine level of 6.3 mg/dl. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were 121 and 65 IU/L, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase level was 290 IU/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level was 290 U/L and lactate dehydrogenase level was 482 U/L. Total bilirubin level was 14.5 mg/dl, with a direct bilirubin level of 10.1 mg/dl. Lactic acid level was 6.4 mg/dl. Prothrombine time was 25.2 s, with an INR of 2.29. Serum alcohol level was within the normal limits. Arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.15, a pCO2 of 23, and a pO2 of 132 while the patient was receiving mechanical ventilation with FIO2 of 60%. Chest X-ray showed left lung infiltrate with pleural effusion.\nAfter 24 h of admission, patient remained in critical condition and requiring maximum doses of vasopressors, despite of what it seems to be the appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy. Blood cultures drawn of admission grew P. multocida. Blood culture system Bact-Alert 3D\u00ae was used for the recovery of the organism. No polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed. Isolate was tested sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam and azithromycin. No minimal inhibitory concentrations for these antimicrobials were reported. In spite of all medical efforts, general medical condition deteriorated and patient expired on day 3 of admission. Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?",

    "question": "A 78-year-old man visited our emergency room with unconsciousness. According to his family, he was poisoned with pesticide (glyphosate) for self-injury purpose. Two years ago, he had a history of cerebral infarction, and he was taking aspirin and medication for hypertension. During gastric lavage in the local clinic emergency room, his heart rate and respiration decreased. Then, he was transferred to the intensive care unit after intubation.\nIntensive care such as continuous renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation was performed in the intensive care unit, and colistin and minocycline were administered for pneumonia. Pulmonary thromboembolism was confirmed by chest computed tomography (CT), and anticoagulant therapy was performed. Acute acalculous cholecystitis occurred simultaneously, and a percutaneous transhepatic GB drainage tube was inserted.\nAfter 2 months of intensive treatment, the patient's condition improved, and cholecystectomy was planned. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and there were no remarkable details of the surgery.\nOn the first day postoperatively, the drainage changed to bile. The patient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 160/105 mm Hg; pulse rate, 143 beats/min; respiratory rate, 37 breaths/min; and body temperature, 39\u00b0C. There was tenderness and rebound tenderness in the whole abdomen, and CT showed pneumoperitoneum and diffuse fluid collection in the right perihepatic space (Figure ). We diagnosed him as having bile peritonitis, and reoperation was decided.\nOn relaparoscopic examination, there was a large amount of bile juice around the GB bed and perihepatic space, and suction and irrigation were performed. The cystic duct stump was confirmed, but there was no leakage. In the GB bed, a leak was observed in a small duct-like structure, which was regarded as an aberrant duct, and the operation was terminated after primary repair (Figure ).\nUntil 6 days postoperatively, hemoserous fluid was drained from the drainage tube. However, from postoperative day 7, the fluid changed to bile, and a percutaneous drainage (PCD) catheter was inserted into the GB bed area after performing CT.\nOn postoperative day 9, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed, and a leak was detected in the branch of the right posterior hepatic duct, which was regarded as an aberrant subvesical bile duct (Figure ). Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and insertion of an endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) stent (7 French, 5 cm) were performed (Figure ).\nOne month after ERBD stent insertion, ERCP was performed again to confirm that there was no leak, and then, the ERBD stent was removed (Figure ).

The patient denied other constitutional symptoms including chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. Vitals were as follows: afebrile, blood pressure 116/80, pulse 72, respiratory rate 21, and saturating well on 3 litres/minute nasal cannula. Physical examination showed pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities till knees, decreased bibasilar breath sounds, and jugular venous distension. There was no rash, painful nodes or splinter hemorrhages. Holosystolic murmur was heard at the apex, JVD \u223c18 cm H2O. Laboratory investigations showed normal WBC count, neutrophilia with 17 bands, 26 lymphocytes, and 8 monocytes. CRP was elevated at 4.3. The patient also had a troponin level of 0.22; however, this was found to be chronically elevated. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, but no pulmonary vascular congestion, consolidation, nor effusions. Urinalysis did not show any evidence of infection. Overnight, the patient developed fever with a maximum temperature of 39.2\u00b0C.\nBlood cultures turned positive for Gram-positive rods at which time the patient was started on vancomycin. Echocardiogram was performed due to concerns of endocarditis and showed left ventricular ejection fraction 20\u201325%, severe diffuse hypokinesis, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a 1 mm mobile strand in the left atrium attached to pacer lead concerning vegetation. Final blood cultures revealed Listeria monocytogenes, and two sets of subsequent cultures grew listeria. TEE was not performed as it would not have changed management. The patient was not a surgical candidate for pacemaker removal due to comorbidities and advanced heart failure. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin was continued. Ampicillin was not used due to high sodium content in the infusion in setting of decreased systolic function. The patient received 6 weeks of IV vancomycin followed by oral suppression with amoxicillin.

    "question": "A 73-year-old man was referred to the Emergency Department of our University Hospital because of fever, dry cough, and worsening dyspnea after contacts with two sons recently diagnosed with COVID-19. No gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were present. History revealed multimorbidity characterized by type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, multivessel coronary artery disease (requiring repeated percutaneous angioplasty with stenting two years before), and a recent diagnosis of primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma (PCLBCL) leg type, localized at the right leg without extra-nodal involvement, which was treated with local radiotherapy two months before.\nThe presenting clinical and imaging picture suggested a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The patient was severely hypoxemic (paO2/FiO2 less than 100), chest X-ray, and computerized tomography (CT) () revealed bilateral interstitial pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed through polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab, and the patient was admitted to a dedicated COVID-19 area. High flows of oxygen and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) were started, and the patient was stimulated to pronation. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a normal QTc interval. Initial blood analysis showed C-reactive protein 263 mg/L, leukocytosis (16,610/mm3) with neutrophilia (15,940/mm3) and marked lymphocytopenia (260/mm3), ferritin 487 mcg/L, D-dimer 719 mcg/L, fibrinogen 8.91 g/L, LDH 287 U/L, lactate 2.9 mmol/L. Hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and liver enzymes were in the normal range. Lymphocyte subpopulations analysis revealed a marked reduction of CD4+ T-cells (100/mm3). Revision of previous records excluded any prior immunodeficiency. Empirical treatment was started with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg BID (after a loading dose of 400 mg BID for the first 24 hours), lopinavir/ritonavir 100/25 mg BID, methyl-prednisolone 80 mg OD (1 mg/kg) with subsequent tapering, and enoxaparin at therapeutic doses. Overall, the duration of the antiviral and methyl-prednisolone treatments was ten days. After an initial critical phase, the respiratory failure slowly improved so that the patient could be gradually weaned from CPAP from day 14 after admission.\nHowever, on day 18, the patient developed epigastric pain, melena, hypotension, tachycardia, and a substantial drop of hemoglobin levels (from 14.5 to 10.6 g/dL). After hemodynamic stabilization with intravenous fluids and transfusion with two units of red blood cells, an upper endoscopy was performed, which showed multiple large and confluent ulcers in the first and second portions of the duodenum (), suggesting a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) duodenitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the positivity of circulating CMV-DNA (6,080 IU/mL titer) and by duodenal histopathological findings (). CMV serologic test showed positive IgG (154 U/mL; positive \u2265 14 U/mL) and borderline IgM at diagnosis. Helicobacter pylori and Epstein-Barr encoded RNA were not found on the histologic specimens.\nEnoxaparin was immediately stopped, and ganciclovir (5 mg/kg BID) was started. The patient also underwent a CT-scan of the abdomen, which showed pancreatitis with a non-homogeneous pattern of the pancreatic head and peripancreatic fluid collection (). Pancreatic amylases and lipases were only slightly increased (59 and 63 U/L, respectively). The clinical evolution was favorable, as abdominal pain disappeared, and pancreatic enzymes returned within the normal range in few days, allowing early enteral refeeding. The CMV-DNA titer dropped to 1,320 IU/mL after 12 days of treatment with ganciclovir. On day 43 from admission, the patient was successfully discharged by the COVID Unit.

    "question": "We report the case of a 51-year-old Moroccan woman admitted to the cardiovascular intensive care unit after mitral valve replacement surgery. Her medical history was significant for organic mitral disease (mild mitral stenosis and severe regurgitation) with preserved left ventricular function, enlarged left atrium, atrial flutter, irritable bowel, and depression. She had been taking acenocoumarol (4 mg) for the last two years to prevent thromboembolic events. The surgical procedure consisted of valvular replacement surgery with a mechanical prosthesis. No thrombus was detected in the left atrium during the perioperative period. During the weaning of the cardiopulmonary bypass (73 min), the patient exhibited supraventricular tachycardia, which was reduced using amiodarone.\nDuring the postoperative period, the hemodynamics were stable without any inotropic or vasopressor agents, and the cardiac rhythm was regular. In the postoperative stage, the patient received fluids, an intravenous curative dose of unfractionated heparin (UFH), and antalgics. The blood test results are presented in Table . Three days later, the patient reported generalized abdominal pain that spread to the flanks with hematuria, constipation, and vomiting. Physical examination showed the following vital signs: body temperature, 37.2\u00b0C; blood pressure, 110/78 mmHg; heart rate, 77 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; and swollen abdomen with a slight stiffness in the renal angles. The rest of the examination results were normal.\nPyelonephritis or mesenteric ischemia was strongly suspected as the cause of her acute pain. The workup revealed high serum creatinine levels, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, high leukocytosis, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Urine analysis showed macroscopic hematuria and aseptic leukocytosis. An abdominal CT scan without contrast showed fecal impaction and infiltration of perirenal fat. Duplex Doppler ultrasound showed aspects of bilateral multifocal cortical renal infarctions (Figure ), which suggested arterial thromboembolic disease.\nThe aorta and renal arteries were permeable with no atherosclerotic plaques. Both the renal vein and inferior vena cava were permeable. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed neither intracardiac nor valvular prosthesis thrombus or endocarditis vegetation. The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 38% with elevated left ventricular filling pressure. The systolic pulmonary arterial pressure was approximately 46 mmHg.\nWe concluded that it was a bilateral renal infarction of probable embolic origin, despite curative heparin. A progressive increase was observed in serum creatinine levels up to 70 mg/L after four days. The urine output up to now was preserved. One month later, the creatinine level increased to 95 mg/L, and the patient was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 70-year-old male patient presented himself to the emergency department due to having had productive cough for one week. He has a past history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage III chronic kidney disease, hypertension, old pulmonary tuberculosis, and poliomyelitis. He also received a mechanical valve replacement for severe tricuspid regurgitation and has been taking warfarin for 10 years. He was admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, and received amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.\nOn the second day after admission, the patient developed massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding with a remarkable decrease of hemoglobin from 11.1 g/dL to 7.6 g/dL. He had a profound coagulopathy with prothrombin time (PT) of 43.4 s, international normalized ratio (INR) of 4.07, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 63.2 s. The platelet count was 252,000/\u03bcL. Warfarin was discontinued. He received blood component therapy and Vitamin K1 to correct anemia and coagulopathy. He also received intravenous esomeprazole. The panendoscopic examination showed an ulcer on the duodenal bulb with an active oozing vessel on the ulcer crater (Fig. -). Hemostasis was performed with epinephrine injection and hemoclipping (Fig. -).\nThe patient had abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension one day after the endoscopic procedure. Hemoglobin was further dropped to 5.8 g/dL, and coagulopathy was worsened with PT of 60.4 s, INR of 5.69, and aPTT of 60.1 s despite of aggressive component therapy. Total serum bilirubin level was rapidly elevated from 1.68 mg/dL to 6.00 mg/dL. Acute pancreatitis was also suspected with a lipase level of 3743 IU/L. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a 14.4 cm \u00d7 7 cm intramural hematoma at the second portion of duodenum (Fig. -). The stomach was distended which indicated gastric outlet obstruction. He also had air retention in the portal vein and wall of esophagus, stomach and bulb (Fig. - to ).\nThe patient developed respiratory failure and shock, and he received support with mechanical ventilation. His bleeding tendency was corrected by vitamin K1 and blood component therapy. Hemodynamic instability was promptly resolved within two days. Abdominal ultrasonography taken six days later showed the finding of complete resolution of the duodenal hematoma, and was confirmed with endoscopy two weeks later (Fig. ). But, his renal function was progressively worsened, and the patient and his family declined hemodialysis therapy. The patient died of renal failure on the 40th day after admission.\nDepending on the involved site of gastrointestinal tract, clinical presentation of PI is usually nonspecific, varying from chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, to gastrointestinal bleeding, or even no symptom [, , ].\nGastric pneumatosis has been described in various circumstances, including patients who have hemorrhagic radiation gastritis after Argon plasma coagulation [], gastric ulcer [], corrosive injury of stomach, status post endoscopy, gastric outlet obstruction, duodenal obstruction, nasogastric tube placement [], hepatectomy with vascular reconstruction, obstructive pulmonary disease with bleb rupture [], and high-dose dexamethasone therapy []. It can be divided into two categories: first, gastric emphysema, implying benign condition and usually being managed by conservative treatment; and second, emphysematous gastritis, suggesting emergent condition, and surgical intervention being critical for life-saving. Mclaughlin et al. have proposed to use the term gangrenous PI/nongangrenous PI instead of emphysematous gastritis/gastric emphysema, to avoid misleading [].\nIDH is also a rare condition that mostly occurs after a blunt abdominal trauma because that the duodenum has rich submucosal vascular supply and is fixed in retroperitoneum []. IDH has also been reported as clinical finding associated with anticoagulant therapy, blood dyscrasia, pancreatic disease, collagen vascular disease [], and diagnostic/therapeutic endoscopy [] such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy and biliary stone retrieval []. It tends to occur in patients with liver cirrhosis, coagulopathy and hemodialysis especially []. IDH is usually confined from the first portion to the second portion of the duodenum due to the barrier of pylorus and ligament of Treitz. Typical symptoms of IDH include epigastric pain, vomiting, and hematochezia. Acute pancreatitis is the most frequent comorbidity in those patients []. Thandassery et al. reported a rare case in a patient who developed intramural duodenal hematoma after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and biliary stone extraction with subsequent of acute pancreatitis, biliary and gastric outlet obstruction after ERCP []. Our patient also had the triad of above symptoms. We also observed rapid decline of hemoglobin level in our patient and this observation has been described in other case reports [, ]. We suggest that the patients should be suspected to have IHD if they have the tetrad of acute pancreatitis, biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction and rapid decline of hemoglobin after an endoscopic examination.\nIn uncomplicated cases, IDH usually resolves spontaneously with conservative treatment in 1\u20133 weeks []. Sadio et al. have reported a case in a patient with intramural gastric hematoma after endoscopic injection therapy, and have found that patient\u2019s hematoma disappear six days later []. In our patient, the IDH was spontaneously resolved under abdominal sonography six days after the endoscopy.\nTo our best knowledge, less than 10 cases of patients with esophageal pneumatosis have been reported [, ], and no esophagogastroduodenal pneumatosis has been reported. The mechanism of PI has been experimentally proved that dissection of the gas from intraluminal to the intramural compartment is due to increased intra-abdominal pressure combined with mucosal defect []. We hypothesize that the findings of our patient are derived from the similar mechanism. The air was inflated from the defect of the needle injection site after endoscopic hemostasis for duodenal ulcer hemorrhage, and warfarin-associated coagulopathy precipitated the formation of IDH, which further dissected the duodenal wall, leading to inflated air entering into the duodenal, gastric and esophageal wall. The inflated air finally entered the portal vein through the portal circulation system.\nTraditionally, once the pneumoporta is recognized along with PI, surgical intervention is preferred due to the concern of having ischemic bowel. But, PI is a radiological finding with wide spectrum of clinical severity and outcome. Surgical or conservative treatment should be considered according to the underlying etiology []. In this patient, esophagogastroduodenal pneumatosis and intramural duodenal hematoma were resolved spontaneously six days later. Therefore, we suggest that conservative treatment and close clinical assessment should be considered as an initial management for patients who complicate with IDH and PI after an endoscopic procedure. But, surgery is needed for those patients if the diseases progress or complications persist. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "An 81-year-old right-handed male presented with acute onset of sound volume loss, inability to swallow and speak, inability to move tongue, and difficulties in chewing the foods. The past medical history was remarkable for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and benign prostate hypertrophy. His first cerebral vascular event presenting with right-sided arm and leg weakness was observed about 4 years ago and his weakness was recovered completely. However, he has not used suggested antiplatelet treatment up to now. The family history was unremarkable.\nIn neurological assessment, he was aphonic, but his verbal and reading perception was normal. He was able to answer the questions with signs and writing. The pupillary, corneal reflexes, and extraocular movements were intact. The left nasolabial sulcus disappeared. He was not able to open the mouth, protrude the tongue, show the teeth, whistle, chew, and swallow. The tongue was on the midline and immobile. No tongue atrophy, fibrillation, and deviation were observed. The taste sensation was intact. Palatal, laryngeal, blink, and gag reflexes, spontaneous smiling, and yawning were protected. The upper and lower limbs muscles strengths were 5/5. Deep tendon reflex was normoactive. Babinski response was absent. Extrapyramidal, coordination, and sensory examinations were normal. No vocal cord paralysis was detected on the laryngoscopic examination. The laboratory investigation including liver and kidney function, complete cell count, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biatrial dilatation, mild calcification of mitral and aortic valves, and mild aortic and mitral valves insufficiency. A doppler ultrasonography of carotid and vertebral arteries was unremarkable. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain indicated right frontal opercular acute infarct with 3.3 \u00d7 2.6 cm on dimensions () and bilateral chronic inferior frontal gyrus infarct (). He was treated with 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid daily and was placed nasogastric tube for feeding due to lack of swallowing function. At the end of the 3rd week, he had nonsense sounds and was able to open the mouth. However, there was no improvement in speech, chewing, and swallowing functions.

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman with the following characteristics was posted for emergency caesarean delivery in view of intra-uterine growth retardation and foetal tachycardia: Second gravida at 35 weeks of gestation with TA, AR and hypertension for 5 years, on treatment with tablet methyldopa 500 mg, amlodipine 5 mg and extended release metoprolol 50 mg, each, twice daily.\nHer pulse rate was 114/min and BP was 183/78 mmHg in right arm supine position. Volume of upper limb pulses appeared to be bilaterally equal on palpation. However, right radial pulse was collapsing in nature along with radio-femoral delay. Grade four early diastolic murmur, loudest in aortic area, with palpable thrill-radiating to left sternal border was present. Examination of other systems and investigations were unremarkable. Two dimensional (2D) echocardiogram revealed narrowing of thoracic and abdominal aorta to 9 mm with a high blood flow velocity of 2.0 m/s. Ascending aorta and aortic arch were dilated along with moderate AR. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 58% with normal biventricular systolic function and normal pulmonary artery pressure. Doppler performed 5 years back showed high resistant flows in common, internal and external carotid arteries bilaterally, with possible proximal stenosis of right subclavian artery (SCA).\nBaseline vitals in the operating room were as follows: Heart rate of 115/min, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) of 188/78 mmHg in right upper limb and SPO2 of 97% [].\nAnaesthetic plan was lumbar epidural anaesthesia with invasive radial arterial BP monitoring prior to placing the epidural. Since the doppler report showed possible stenosis of right SCA, left radial arterial line was secured and the invasive BP (IBP) was 112/55 mmHg. Lower limb arterial monitoring was not considered due to narrowing of thoraco-abdominal aorta. Epidural catheter was secured in L1-L2 intervertebral space, and the position was confirmed with test dose of 3 ml of 2% preservative free lignocaine. Patient was positioned supine with a wedge under the right buttock. To achieve a sensory block up to T6 level, 10 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was given in 5-ml increments every 10 minutes. There was a drop in IBP to 80/40 mmHg along with a drop of NIBP to 122/60 mmHg after the epidural over 10 minutes. We treated the drop in IBP with 6 mg ephedrine boluses to avoid any cerebral or utero-placental hypoperfusion. There was ill-sustained increase in IBP and NIBP after each bolus (3 boluses provided). BP increased up to 122/64 mmHg, while the NIBP increased up to 198/94 mmHg after the third bolus of ephedrine. Patient complained of headache after each bolus of ephedrine. Possibility of over treating IBP leading to headache was considered after ruling out possibilities of monitoring error. On-table doppler ultrasound of upper limb arteries was performed specifically looking at the luminal diameter and amplitude of pulsations. Both were reduced in the left radial and axillary artery when compared to the right radial and axillary artery. Right radial pulsation was collapsing in nature, which is expected in AR. Thereafter, we considered treating using the NIBP values of the right upper limb. Meanwhile, the baby delivered was shifted to neonatal intensive care unit in view of prematurity. Rest of the intra-operative period was uneventful. Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in a high dependency unit. Post-operative aortogram revealed normal right SCA and diffuse disease of the left distal SCA, which confirmed our intra-operative findings. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 78-year-old Caucasian woman with no known past medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of bilateral lower extremity edema and erythema with a clear serous discharge. The patient first noticed some small blisters on her left lower extremity which subsequently opened with some clear serous drainage. She also experienced progressively worsening swelling first of the left lower extremity and then her right lower extremity which prompted her to come into the hospital. Except for a cough, the patient had no other symptoms.\nPreliminary evaluation at the emergency department indicated the patient had cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions with a BNP of 1260. She also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was not complaining of any chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Her chest x-ray showed evidence of cardiac enlargement with interstitial densities and bilateral air-space processes possibly associated with asymmetric pulmonary edema. Large bilateral pleural effusions were noted, with the left greater than the right side. Incidentally, some evidence indicating a compression fracture of indeterminate age involving the upper lumbar/lower dorsal spine was observed.\nThe patient had no known medical history. In fact, she had not been seen by a physician for the last 15 years. Besides taking aspirin occasionally, she was not on any medications. She did not use alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs. Physical examination did not reveal any specific concerns other than bilateral lower extremity edema.\nCT angiogram of the chest showed large bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe enhancing volume loss and worse on the left. Cardiomegaly was noted and there was no evidence for a pulmonary embolus. In addition, there was no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the venous Doppler studies of her lower extremities bilaterally.\nEchocardiogram indicated the left ventricle with some mild hypertrophy. Systolic function was normal with an ejection fraction estimated at about 60%. The right ventricle was mildly enlarged and mildly hypokinetic. The left atrium showed marked enlargement and the right atrium was moderately enlarged as well. The aortic valve was mildly sclerotic and trileaflet. The pulmonic valve was unremarkable. The mitral valve showed flail motion of the posterior leaflet and there was a small mobile echo seen in the left atrium which strongly indicated endocarditis as the cause for pulmonary edema. Doppler examination showed severe mitral regurgitation that tracked underneath the anterior leaflet along the interatrial septum. There was mild aortic insufficiency. The inferior vena cava was dilated indicating elevated right atrial pressure and the pulmonary systolic pressure was estimated at about 50 mmHg.\nGram positive cocci in diploids, tetrads, and clusters were isolated from three sets of blood cultures. The organism was catalase positive and produced a negative coagulase reaction by SlidexTM (BioM\u00e9rieux, NC). The Vitek 2 GP card (BioM\u00e9rieux, MO) identified the bacterium as Staphylococcus warneri. It produced acid from trehalose and lacked phosphatase enzyme, two key characteristics that differentiate this species from S. epidermidis - one of the most recognized CoNS [].\nThe patient was initially treated with Unasyn, 3 grams IV every 6 hours for presumed bilateral lower extremity cellulitis. After the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis was made and supported by the echo-cardiographic results, the patient was started on nafcillin with gentamicin following consultation with the infectious diseases specialist. In addition, congestive heart failure was treated initially with lasix IV and subsequently with lasix orally. Atrial fibrillation was rate controlled with diltiazem. Gentamicin was later discontinued due to acute renal failure, and the patient was discharged with a PICC line for treatment with 2 grams Nafcillin intravenously every 4 hours for a total of 6 weeks. Repeat blood cultures were negative for 48 hours prior to discharge. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

One day before admission, she developed weakness in her left arm and disorientation, followed 20 hours later by inappropriate speech, agitation, and dysarthria. She had a history of hypertension and diabetes, but no history of psychiatric illness. She had no family history of affective illness.\nOn admission, she showed partially impaired orientation to time, but had well-preserved orientation to place and person. The neurological examination revealed left homonymous hemianopsia, but no obvious motor or sensory deficits. She appeared agitated, and was talkative with an elated, euphoric mood. She also had a reduced need for sleep and pressured speech. She tended to touch the examiner while speaking. She showed no deficits in the line bisection and cancellation tasks, but was unable to copy an interlocked pentagon. She was also unable to draw a clock. Three days later, she developed motor weakness (grade 4) and hypesthesia in her left arm and face. Dysarthria developed along with persistence of her restlessness and manic features. The motor deficits and dysarthria were improved the next day, but the sensory deficit was unchanged.\nRoutine serologic testing and electrocardiography were all normal. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) was performed on admission, which revealed an acute infarction in the right parietal lobe with subtle involvement of the posterior temporal area (). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed an obstruction of portion M1 of the right middle cerebral artery (). Repeat MRI on the fourth hospital day after the motor deficits developed revealed that the infarction had increased in size (). Brain 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) performed 13 days after admission showed reduced FDG uptake in the right hemisphere, which was most severe in the right parietal lobe and left cerebellum ().\nWhen she was discharged 2 weeks after admission, her neurological deficits had improved. Her restlessness and manic symptoms had also partially alleviated without treatment. After 13 months, her neurological deficits and manic symptoms had resolved completely, except for the left-sided visual field defect.

On physical examination, his blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 76\nb.p.m. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for an aortic systolic murmur best heard at the\nsecond intercostal space with a significant decrease in S2. The transthoracic echocardiogram\n(TTE) showed ASH with a diastolic septal diameter of 17 mm, a fixed LVOT gradient of\n11 mmHg, moderately calcified aortic valve associated with severe stenosis (mean gradient of\n42 mmHg, the maximal velocity of 4.05 m/s, the continuity equation was not applicable to\ncalculate aortic valve area due to accelerated jet in the LVOT), an ejection fraction (EF)\nof 60%, and normal systolic pulmonary artery pressure. Cardiac catheterization revealed\nnormal coronary angiogram. He had a low risk for open-heart surgery (Logistic Euro score\n7.96%, STS score 2.9%) with a frail physical state for which the Heart team decided to refer\nhim for TAVI. Computed tomography and angiography showed ASH with a moderately calcified\naortic valve, mild LVOT calcifications (), and an accessible femoral route.\nThe TAVI procedure was performed with a 26 mm Sapien 3 bioprosthetic valve (Edwards\nLifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). The initial result was acceptable, with no PVL nor coronary\nobstruction. We noticed an upward movement of the valve during implantation (). There was no pre- nor post-dilations required.

Following the onset of stroke, the patient was initially treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) before being transferred to the neurology ward. Following discharge from the ward, a monoarthritis of the left knee developed. According to the patient\u2019s relatives, the patient\u2019s knee was evaluated by an orthopedics and traumatology team; however, no details of the evaluation/investigations/ treatment applied are known. To date, the patient had not partaken in a home exercise program or received physical therapy. The patient\u2019s past medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and a right total knee replacement five years previously due to osteoarthritis. Prior to development of the stroke, the patient was independent of activities of daily living.\nPhysical examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Score of 12 with motor and sensory aphasia. There was a flaccid paralysis of the right side. No spasticity was detected. The patient was incontinent of urine and feces. Examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed bilateral painful and limited ROM of the hips and left knee contracture. There was no effusion of the joints. The patient\u2019s Functional Independence Measure[] score was 23.\nThe patient\u2019s initial routine blood tests were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 69 mm/hour and the C-reactive protein was 11.4 mg/L. An anteroposterior X-ray of the\npelvis revealed extensive bilateral periarticular HO (Figure 1). A two-way bilateral X-ray of the knees revealed a total knee replacement on the right side and extensive osteoarthritis of the left knee (Figure 2). Pharmacological treatment with indomethacin was commenced. The Orthopedics and Traumatology Department was consulted for further management of the bilateral hip HO and left knee contracture. Initially, arthroscopic debridement of the left knee was recommended; however, the patient\u2019s relatives did not consent to the procedure. Due to the patient\u2019s limited cooperation, immobility, poor right-sided motor recovery, bilateral limited hip movement and left knee contracture, it was decided that she would gain little benefit from an active inpatient rehabilitation program.

    "question": "We report on a case of a 73-year-old man who presented to our emergency department due to progressive shortness of breath (). He was an ex-smoker (30 pack-years of cigarette smoking), with a medical history of dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, PAD, and left main coronary artery disease (CAD), which led to CABG surgery four months previously. His medical therapy included warfarin, antihypertensive drugs, statin, and a proton-pump inhibitor. Since surgery, he felt a gradual reduction in functional capacity with significant worsening of dyspnea in the last three days. On physical examination, the patient was mildly dyspnoic at rest and had low blood pressure (BP) readings of 105/74 mm Hg on the right arm and 97/69 mm Hg on the left arm. Heart sounds were quiet and irregular. Lung sound was clear bilaterally, with the exception of fine crackles in the right base. Jugular venous pressure was mildly elevated, and there was no evidence of peripheral edema. The rest of physical examination was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 90 beats per minute (bpm), incomplete left bundle branch block, and diffuse T wave inversion in precordial leads. Laboratory tests demonstrated markedly elevated NT-proBNP levels of 3564 ng/L (reference levels <0.73 mg/L), mild increase in serial high sensitive troponin essays (hsTnT) of 31 ng/L and 51 ng/L (reference levels <14 ng/L), and normocytic anemia of 115 g/L (reference levels 138-175 g/L). The chest x-ray displayed an enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild pleural effusion and cranial redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, suggesting heart failure. Given the patient`s symptoms, CT pulmonary angiography was also requested to rule out pulmonary embolism. The test did not show signs of pulmonary embolus but showed a large circulatory pericardial effusion (). The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit. The bedside echo showed global hypocontractility of the left ventricle (ejection fraction of 40%) with a confirmed large circulatory pericardial effusion and increased respiratory variations in mitral and tricuspid inflow. Pericardiocentesis was performed with the drainage of 1500 mL of sanguineous effusion over a couple of days. The control laboratory tests showed an hsTnT increase (1865 ng/L) without the progression of clinical symptoms and without echographic or ECG changes. Coronary angiography showed significant stenosis of the left subclavian artery just proximal to the functional LIMA graft to the left anterior descending artery, which indicated the presence of CSSS. While the sudden hsTnT increase could have been explained by pericardiocentesis and consequential hemodynamic changes, myocardial strain, or mild myocardial trauma, it is likely that CSSS had significantly aggravated myocardial perfusion in specific hemodynamic circumstances following pericardiocentesis. Although subclavian bruit was absent, DUS of upper extremities showed reduced blood flow in the left arm, while CTA confirmed the previous angiographic finding and the anomalous origin of the left vertebral artery from the aorta (). As a result, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed. A stent was implanted in the stenotic subclavian artery, followed by optimal blood flow across the treated vessel (). The procedure's success was later also confirmed with control DUS. Control echocardiographic study revealed the absence of pericardial effusion and improvement in cardiac systolic function, which correlated with the patient` s clinical recovery. The patient was discharged from the hospital in a stable condition. What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "We report the case of a 32-year-old Chinese patient who had a history of two pregnancy-related thromboembolic events. These events were cerebral vein-venous sinus thrombosis at 5 gestational weeks (GW) when she was 27 years old and left lower thrombosis following a miscarriage in her second pregnancy in the first trimester at 29 years old. At that point, she was then treated with warfarin.\nAfter routine assessments were performed in the patient at 32 years old, no inherited or acquired risk factors for thrombosis or related family history were discovered, except for AT activity. Her AT activity was only 37% (normal range: 75%\u2013125%) (Berichrom Antithrombin III; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) while the AT antigen (BN ProSpec system AT-III; Siemens) was 93% (normal range: 80%\u2013120%). The D-dimer concentration was 0.2 \u00b5g/mL D-dimer units (normal range: 0\u20130.5 \u00b5g/mL D-dimer units), platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid was 82% (normal range: 60%\u201380%), the prothrombin time was 13.5 s (normal range: 10.3\u201316.6 s), and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 32 s (normal range: 25.1\u201336.5 s). Her fibrinogen concentration was 1.13 \u00b5g/mL (normal range: 0\u20135 \u00b5g/mL), protein C activity was 98.8% (normal range: 70%\u2013140%), protein S activity was 93.8% (normal range: 63.5%\u2013149%), and homocysteine concentration was 9.8 \u00b5mol/L (normal range: 3\u201317 \u00b5mol/L). Antiphospholipid antibodies, including lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and beta-2 glycoprotein I-dependent anticardiolipin antibodies, were negative.\nThe SERPINC1 gene in this patient was then analyzed by the gold standard Sanger fluorescent sequencing method in which all exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter region were examined (ABI PRISM 3130; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Molecular analysis showed a heterozygous mutation, which led to a tyrosine to cysteine change at amino acid position 95, compatible with a type II HBS defect (). On the basis of the findings of a low AT activity level, normal AT antigen level, and genetic result, we made the diagnosis of type II hereditary AT deficiency. Unfortunately, her parents were not available for laboratory assessment for AT activity and genetic testing.\nWhen the patient was 31 years old, she consulted her doctor because she wanted to become pregnant again. At the start of her pregnancy, thromboprophylaxis with self-injection of LMWH at 4100 units every 12 hours with FFP 1 unit weekly was prescribed to replace warfarin because of its adverse effects on the fetus. She had arachidonic acid and D-dimer concentrations measured fortnightly, while her AT activity and anti-Xa measurements were checked monthly throughout pregnancy (). Her serum AT activity level remained at 30% to 40%, but no thrombosis occurred during pregnancy. Her plasma D-dimer concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 \u00b5g/mL D-dimer units, which were within the expected range for pregnant women. Nevertheless, peak anti-Xa activity levels ranged from 0 to 0.29 IU/mL in the second trimester. This activity was not consistent with the required dose ranging from 0.5 to 1 U/mL 2 to 4 hours following the injection. This finding indicated the phenomenon of HR.\nAfter 14 GW, she used LMWH as a bridge to warfarin, then she continued warfarin therapy before delivery. The international normalized ratio was monitored weekly to achieve a level between 2.0 and 3.0. She resumed LMWH and FFP from 37 GW. A cesarean section was scheduled at 37+4 GW. The patient delivered a healthy, 3165-g girl with Apgar scores of 10 at both 1 and 5 minutes. There were no adverse effects of the anticoagulation therapies. The patient and her newborn were discharged without morbidity 7 days later. She continued the same doses of LMWH with FFP, which was replaced with oral anticoagulant therapy from 6 weeks after delivery. The patient and her infant were healthy with no sequelae or adverse events at a follow-up visit 6 weeks after delivery.\nThe reporting of this study conforms to the CARE guidelines.

The patient complained of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 24 hours. The patient mentioned an inability to tolerate solid food for approximately one year. The physical examination showed no acute distress, no respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and the abdomen was obese and non-tender, without rebound or guarding. An NG tube was placed. His vital signs revealed a temperature of 36.5 \u00b0C, blood pressure 143/119 mmHg , pulse 163 beats/minute, respiratory rate 19 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. Laboratory evaluation showed WBC count of 26 k/\u03bcL with 90% neutrophils, albumin 1.4 mmol/L, BNP 2,300 pg/mL, international normalized ratio 1.4, BUN 22 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.1 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast showed severe distention of the stomach and duodenum with extensive gas in the wall of the dependent portion of the stomach and extension of gas into the adjacent gastric veins, portal vein, and portal vein branches within the liver [Figure ].\nThe branches of the celiac artery and SMA were patent. The patient was resuscitated with crystalloids, given broad-spectrum antibiotics, NG tube for gastric decompression, diltiazem infusion for atrial fibrillation, and admitted to the ICU. The patient declined any surgical intervention.\nOn the second day in the hospital, the patient showed improvement with his abdominal pain, now a 4/10 down from 10/10 on admission. The patient remained on a diltiazem drip for his atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. His abdomen was soft and non-tender; however, his NG tube output was approximately 1 L of bilious fluid. On the third day, the NG tube output was 900 mL of bilious fluid overnight and he had no bowel movement since admission. The WBC reduced to 12,000/\u03bcL and he had a benign abdominal examination. CT scan was done with enteral and intravenous contrast to assess for bowel obstruction. It showed that the stomach was now decompressed and there was decreased air within the wall of the stomach and the previously seen air within the left gastric vein and the gastroepiploic veins had resolved [Figure ].\nThe small intestines, appendix, and colon appeared normal.

    "question": "An 82-year-old female with secondary post-herpetic uveitic glaucoma of the right eye presented at the Department of Ophthalmology for an elective trans-scleral laser cyclophotocoagulation. She had a history of chronic heart failure, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in remission. Her regular medications included acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate, telmisartan, atorvastatin and escitaloprame. The patient denied having any allergies. On preoperative assessment she weighed 62 kg, her height was 162 cm and her blood pressure (BP) was 166/83 mmHg with 70/min heart rate (HR). Physical examination was unremarkable.\nThe patient\u2019s orbit was anatomically normal. She was given a retrobulbar block to the right eye with 2 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 2 mL of 2% lidocaine. No mydriatic agent was used. She did not move her eye during the procedure. Aspiration for blood was negative. Upon injection, no resistance was felt. 2-3 minutes after the injection, she started yawning and feeling progressively drowsy; anaesthesiology team was immediately called. 5-8 minutes after the injection she became unresponsive to verbal and tactile stimuli; her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 3. On arrival of the team she had developed bradycardia with hypotension, her HR was 40/min, BP 50/30 mmHg and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) 85%. 10 mg of ephedrine was promptly administered intravenously (i.v.) with no significant effect, continued by 3 i.v. doses of 0.1 mg adrenaline 2 minutes later. Concurrently the patient developed respiratory arrest, her SpO2 had fallen to 54%, BP was 163/100 mmHg with HR 93/min. A bolus of 200 mL intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) was given. Anaesthesia was induced with 50 mg of propofol, the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated, and her vitals had stabilized (SpO2 98%, BP 113/60 mmHg, HR 92/min). She was additionally sedated with 5 mg of midazolam. Because of persistent hypotension (RR 92/58), 500 mL of hydroxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.4) in isotonic sodium chloride solution was also administered.\nSurgery was cancelled and the patient was relocated to the ICU. She was additionally sedated with midazolam and propofol, then gradually shifted through supportive ventilation techniques to spontaneous ventilation and extubated 6 hours after admission. There was no need for vasoactive support, oxygen or fluid replacement therapy. Blood test results were within normal range. Her BP was 140/60 mmHg, HR 71/min, SpO2 95%, without additional oxygen. Her GCS score was 15. The next day she was discharged to the Department of Ophthalmology, where the intended procedure was performed under general anaesthesia. The patient was discharged home 6 days later, she was stable and had not suffered any consequences from the adverse reaction.\nInformed consent has been obtained from the patient to use the data presented in this case report.\nThe research has been complied with all the relevant national regulations, institutional policies and in accordance the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration.

The patient was admitted to the emergency general surgical service for complaints of acute onset colicky periumbilical abdominal pain, progressive abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting for 2 days. Emesis was described as non-bloody and non-bilious. Other pertinent history included one bowel movement 12 h prior to admission, which was non-bloody and inability to pass flatus for more than 24 h. No previous episode of abdominal pain of similar nature were elicitated. Physical examination was significant for mild abdominal distension and generalized tenderness to palpation in all quadrants without signs of peritonitis. Patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Significant laboratory findings were INR of 2.20 (on warfarin for valve replacement), hyponatremia of 125, acute kidney injury with creatinine of 1.56. computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis was significant for high-grade small bowel obstruction with a swirling of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) suggesting rotation of intestinal mesentery (Fig. ) []. The SMV was located to the right of SMA, a reliable finding against intestinal malrotation [] (Fig. ). Further, there was no radiologic evidence of malrotation like transposition of SMA and SMV, the horizontal part of the duodenum not reaching medioventral line, and malposition of ileocecal junction []. The INR was not reversed with FFP and Vitamin K due to concern for stroke. Emergent exploratory laparotomy within 6 h of admission was performed which was significant for midgut volvulus with the small bowel rotating around the base of mesentery a complete 360\u00b0. There were no signs of ischemia, and hence manual untwisting of the bowel was performed [, ]. The cecum was noted to be on the right lower quadrant and ligament of Treitz was on the left upper quadrant. The small bowel mesentery was noted to appear long with narrow base and floppy likely contributing to hypermobility of the small bowel.

She had a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.\nOn general medical evaluation she was alert but disorientated. Her blood pressure was 170/80, serum glucose value 89 mg/dl, and cholesterol 213 mg/dl.\nAt 12:00 she underwent an emergent brain CT scan, which revealed no hemorrhage and only a mild front left hypodensity in the insular area. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score was 8. CT angiogram showed an occlusion of the left M1 trunk, and CT perfusion (CTP) revealed a mismatch among the CBF (cerebral blood flow), MTT (mean transit time), and CBV (cerebral blood volume) maps (Figure ).\nAll stroke patients arriving at our hospital undergo an emergent brain CT scan, CT angiogram (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP), according to a protocol agreed upon by neurologists and intensivists.\nOn the basis of the presence of penumbra, the decision was taken to transfer the patient to an angiographic ward.\nBecause the angiographic suite was busy with other procedures, an angiography was performed 6 h after the onset of symptoms without any change in her clinical condition. It confirmed an occlusion of the main M1 trunk with excellent collateral circulation from the leptomeningeal anterior cerebral artery and retrograde opacification of the distal M1 segment.\nAn angiogram was obtained by pulling back the microcatheter to show the extent of the thrombus.\nAccording to exclusion criteria of the SITS-MOST Study Protocol [], Rendu Osler syndrome represents an absolute contraindication for rt PA infusion.\nWe opted for a mechanical thrombectomy performed more than 6 h after the onset of the stroke with a Hyperform 4 mm \u00d7 7 mm balloon angioplasty (EV3) positioned inside the thrombus. Recanalization was achieved with rapid inflations (duration of the inflation, maximum 10 s) at different levels of the M1 trunk.\nAt the end of the procedure, the artery was recanalized. Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Perfusion Categories (TICI) was grade 3 (Figure ).\nFollow-up CTP after 24 h and 7 days revealed persistence of the mismatch (Figure ).\nNIHSS score at 24 h was 8, and the Rankin scale at 3 months documented a slight disability (Modified Rankin Score 2).

    "question": "We report the case of a 58-year-old male that presented to our Emergency Department with complaints of acute interscapular back pain and bilateral lower extremities weakness.\nPatient's medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. His surgical history consisted of umbilical hernia repair and left hip arthroplasty. Patient had no allergies and had stopped smoking many years ago. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 30 days prior to admission, for which he was started on rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. The rest of his medications included atorvastatin, fish oil, sitagliptin, quinapril, and triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide.\nOn the day of admission, the patient admitted waking up at 3:00 am with sudden onset, sharp, interscapular back pain. He denied any similar pain in the past. The patient first presented to another institution, where he started having bilateral lower extremities numbness, which progressed rapidly to bilateral weakness. At this point, he was still able to walk but with difficulty. He was then transferred to our institution, where his weakness became more pronounced. Patient denied any other neurologic symptoms. There was no history of trauma. Prior to this, he had a left hip arthroplasty three weeks earlier, which was performed under spinal (lumbar) anesthesia, without complications. Rivaroxaban was stopped three days before the surgery. Postoperatively he did not receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was restarted on the OAC few days later. Moreover, he reported driving for almost 7 hours from Elmira (New York) to Staten Island (New York) one day prior to presentation.\nInitial physical examination revealed an alert and oriented patient in no acute distress, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. His blood pressure was 148/98 mmHg; heart rate was 82 beats/min and irregular; body temperature was 98.7\u00b0F; respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams were within normal limits. Tenderness was elicited over the upper thoracic spine. There were no neurological deficits in the cranial nerves or upper limbs. The motor strength in both lower limbs was of Medical Research Council grade 0/5. A sensory level was evident at the level of T2 with positive bilateral Babinski reflexes.\nInitial laboratory assays included a hemoglobin concentration of 11 g/dL, a platelet count of 176 \u00d7 109/L, an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 36.6 seconds, a prothrombin time (PT) of 18.4 seconds, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.6. Kidney function and liver enzymes were normal. Electrocardiogram and chest radiograph were unremarkable. A noncontrast computerized tomography (CT) of the brain was negative for bleed, and a CT of the chest was also negative for dissection.\nThe clinical presentation combined with findings on the neurological exam pointed towards a spinal pathology. Moreover, a spinal bleed was strongly suspected given the history of recent spinal anesthesia in addition to the rivaroxaban use. An emergent cervical and thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an acute 6.3 \u00d7 0.6 \u00d7 1.6 cm intradural hematoma from C7 to T2, with spinal cord edema (). Neurosurgical intervention was not deemed an option at this point given that the increased risk of rivaroxaban-induced bleeding outweighed the benefits. Therefore, a conservative management was adopted, including close neurological monitoring in the intensive care unit along with high dose intravenous dexamethasone (100 mg once followed by 10 mg every 6 hrs). Patient was also offered prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), but he declined to proceed with this therapeutic option given its potential side effects, such as prothrombotic state, as well as its uncertain efficacy in similar spinal bleed. He was started instead on aminocaproic acid.\nThe following day, patient's neurological exam had improved. Sensory level was down to T4-T5, and motor strength was 4/5 in the right lower extremity while it remained 1/5 on the left lower extremity. Given the increased risk of bleeding, especially taking into account the minor improvement in the patient's condition, surgical intervention was delayed for three days, to allow complete elimination of rivaroxaban. On hospital day 4, patient underwent a successful and uneventful anterior C7 corpectomy with resection of a large intradural hematoma. Postoperatively, his neurological exam continued to improve slowly, and he was discharged for intensive rehabilitation 5 days after the surgery. A repeat MRI done 6 weeks later showed almost complete resolution of the spinal hemorrhage (). What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?",

    "question": "A 71-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history significant for type-2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic pericardial effusion and hypothyroidism presented with 5 weeks of increasing fatigue and 1 day of dizziness.\nPhysical examination revealed that the patient was afebrile, had a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, an irregularly irregular heart rate of 102 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. There was no pulsus parodoxus. Examination of the head and neck showed pale conjunctiva, no palpable lymphadenopathy, jugular venous distension or bruits. Auscultation of the chest revealed scattered rhonchi. The patient was mildly tachycardic with no S3 or S4 heart sounds, murmurs or rubs appreciated. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, clubbing, cyanosis or edema and stools were guaiac negative.\nAn electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response with low voltage QRS complexes; electrical alternans were not present. The chest radiograph showed a very minimal pleural effusion with no cardiomegaly, infiltrates or masses.\nLaboratory analysis revealed a white blood-cell count of 12,900/L, with a normal differential, and a hemoglobin and hematocrit of 7.2 g/dl and 23.4%, respectively. The platelet count was 387 thousand/L. The red cell indices were microcytic and iron studies revealed an iron deficiency anemia. Liver function tests were normal. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 167 U/L (within normal limits). The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 16.49 mcIU/ml and the free T3 was 57 mcg/ml.\nThe patient was admitted for anemia and worked up for a gastrointestinal bleed. Three units packed red blood cells were transfused. Upper endoscopy revealed a mass just below the gastroesophageal junction and three nonbleeding gastric ulcers. To further evaluate the gastric mass, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed demonstrating a 30 \u00d7 17 mm polypoid mass visualized in the gastric cardia limited to the mucosa/submucosa. The biopsy revealed gastric adenocarcinoma, staged as T1N0M0 by EUS, and was Helicobacter pylori-negative.\nA two-dimensional echocardiogram was preformed to evaluate an 8-month old pericardial effusion. It demonstrated a 2.0 \u00d7 2.7 cm mass associated with the right atrium (RA). To better define the mass and its anatomic relationship within the RA, several imaging procedures were performed: 1) transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing a 5.7 cm2 shaped echodensity within the wall of the RA and a second, 16 cm2 echodensity, that extended across the atrioventricular groove (Figure ); 2) a contrast computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis negative for metastasis, but significant for a large pericardial effusion without pericardial thickening and a 2.6 \u00d7 2.1 cm filling defect in the right atrial appendage (Figure ); and 3) a cardiac MRI demonstrating a homogenous enhancing mass along the lateral wall of the right atrium. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated a hypermetabolic region in the heart corresponding to the mass observed on CT.\nAt this point, our differential diagnosis included a primary gastric adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the heart as well as two separate primary neoplastic processes (one involving the heart and one involving the stomach).\nTo determine the etiology of the cardiac mass, a biopsy was accomplished via a pericardial window through an anterolateral thoracotomy. At thoracotomy, the parietal pericardium appeared normal. Visual inspection revealed several nodular areas over the body of the right atrium, superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC). There was no evidence of a thickened, constrictive layer surrounding the heart. Two hundred milliliters of straw-colored fluid was recovered from the pericardial cavity. The fluid was negative for malignant cells and consisted of a few benign and reactive mesothelial cells mixed with inflammatory cells and proteinaceous debris. Viral, bacterial and mycobacterial cultures of the pericardial fluid were negative. Biopsy revealed a normal parietal pericardium and myocardium. However, the visceral pericardium showed a lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate diagnostic of epicarditis (Figure ). After thoracotomy, the patient had a partial gastrectomy to remove the adenocarcinoma. The postoperative course was complicated by infection, requiring a 3-month stay in the intensive care unit. During this time, there was no evidence suggestive of constrictive physiology. Since the patient continued to remain asymptomatic from the epicarditis, no further imaging studies or procedures were performed to follow the \"mass.\" The patient eventually succumbed to infection.

    "question": "A 68-year-old woman visited our emergency department (ED) because of a sudden attack of severe back pain. The pain developed so suddenly that the ED physician provided a tentative diagnosis of aortic dissection. Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement revealed no findings related to the pain and both aortic dissection and any aortic involvement were excluded. The ED physician prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The next day, the patient presented to the outpatient department and was admitted for further examination. She had medical histories of asthma and atrial fibrillation, was not receiving any medication, was a current smoker, and was not an alcohol consumer. She owned a corgi dog that lived in her house and she had been bitten and scratched by the dog daily.\nUpon admission, her body temperature was 37.5 \u00b0C, with blood pressure 127/48 mmHg, heart rate 84 beats per minute and oxygen saturation 95% in ambient air with no accelerated respiration. She looked very ill suffering from the severe back pain. A physical examination did not note spinal knocking pain, neurological abnormality, or any other specific findings. A laboratory test revealed a white blood cell count of 13,360 cells/mm3 (normal value: 3900\u20139800 cells/mm3), platelet count of 17.0 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL, serum creatinine level of 0.66 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein level of 18.5 mg/dL (normal value: 0\u20130.5 mg/dL). Re-performed enhanced CT and plane magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was not diagnostic.\nOn the second hospital day, Gram-negative bacilli were detected in her blood cultures. We started intravenous meropenem 1 g every 8 h, based on a provisional diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess or vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis. P. multocida was identified, and drug susceptibility was confirmed by the Vitek2 system with GN and AST-N228 card, bioM\u00e9rieux (Table ) []. Then, the antimicrobial treatment was switched to intravenous ampicillin 2 g every 6 h.\nOn the eighth hospital day, MRI was re-performed with gadolinium-contrast to confirm the diagnosis. T2-weighted imaging and T1-weighted imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed an epidural abscess at the Th5\u20136 level (Fig. ). We decided to withhold a surgery and continued the conservative treatment because of absence of a neurological deficit. On the twenty-fourth hospital day, the abscess had disappeared on the plane MRI. The antimicrobial treatment was switched to oral levofloxacin 500 mg every 24 h before hospital discharge. In total, 12-week antibiotic treatment was completed.

    "question": "This is the case of a 73-year-old woman affected by hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis. The HBV infection was diagnosed in 1981, when she underwent gastrectomy for complicated gastric ulcer. In February 1998, she underwent treatment with 3 million units of Interferon alpha 3 times per week per 24 weeks, without obtaining a biochemical and virological response. She was admitted to our Liver Unit in 1999. She appeared to be in satisfactory general clinical condition and reported being affected by osteoporosis (for which she was treated with calcium and cholecalciferol). She had no history of heart, lung, kidney, metabolic, or thyroid diseases. A needle liver biopsy was performed and histological cirrhosis was diagnosed. At that time the HBV-DNA quantification showed 330,000 copies/ml (COBAS AmpliPrep System, Roche Diagnostics, Monza, Italy) and therapy with 100 mg/die of lamivudine was therefore started. The treatment was promptly and persistently efficacious. Subsequently, the patient regularly attended the outpatient clinic of our liver unit. In February 2010, as a consequence of a slight increase of HBV-DNA levels (up to 300 IU/ml), tenofovir dipivoxil 245 mg/die therapy was introduced, replacing lamivudine.\nOn November 3, 2011 the alpha-fetoprotein level rose to 217.5 ng/ml and an HCC nodule measuring 14 mm in diameter located in the right lobe was diagnosed by contrast iodine-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Iodopride at a concentration of 370 mg/ml was the contrast medium used and it was administered intravenously at a dosage of 1.2 ml per kilogram of body weight. In December 2011, the patient underwent percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of the lesion and was subsequently followed up with periodic CECT examinations, according to AASLD practice guidelines; a total of 3 CECTs were performed without the occurrence of any side effect. In occasion of the CECT control on February 5, 2013, the patient appeared to be in good general clinical condition, the blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, the electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal, the heart rate was 68 beats per minutes (bpm), the blood tests were normal, HBV-DNA was undetectable. However, 4 hours after the CECT scan with iodine contrast medium administration the patient complained of palpitations, dizziness, and epigastric pain. The blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, radial pulse was frequent and irregular, and ECG revealed the presence of high frequency AF (120 bpm). The cardiac enzymes, evaluated every 6 hours from the onset of AF for 24 hours, were persistently within normal ranges. She was treated intravenously with amiodarone 5 mg/kg for the first hour and subsequently at the dosage of 50 mg/hour for maintenance and with subcutaneous 6000 IU/die of enoxaparin. Twenty-four hours after onset of symptoms, there was a reversion to sinus rhythm and on February 6 the patient was discharged from the hospital (Figures and ). During hospitalization, an echocardiographic examination was performed which showed the presence of mitral annulus calcification with mitral insufficiency of moderate degree and mild enlargement of the left atrium.\nFour months later the patient was scheduled for a further CECT scan control. At admission on June 10, she exhibited laboratory tests\u2014including thyroid hormone values\u2014within normal limits, she had no symptoms, her liver disease was compensated, the blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg, the ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with heart rate of 68 bpm. One hour after the intravenous iodide contrast medium administration, she complained about an intense chest pain without any irradiation. The blood pressure was 100/70 mm Hg, her heart rate was irregular with 150 bpm and ECG analysis identified AF. The cardiac enzyme levels were within normal ranges. Therapy with aiodarone was promptly started but this time it had no clinical effect. Therefore the patient underwent electrical cardioversion, which succeeded in reverting to sinus rhythm (Figures and ). During hospitalization a neck ultrasonography examination was performed that showed an increased volume of the thyroid, many small hypo-echoic nodules (diameter <0.5 cm) and swollen cervical lymph nodes. Thyroid tests revealed a profile of subclinical hyperthyroidism [TSH 0.146 \u03bcIU/ml (normal range 0.3\u20134.2); FT3 0.9 ng/ml (normal range 0.87\u20131.78); FT4 9.12 \u03bcg/dl (normal range 6.09\u201312.23)]. On June 13, 2013 treatment with flecainide 100 mg/die was started; the patient showed no signs of AF and she was discharged from the hospital. Thereafter the patient underwent surveillance of HCC by both ultrasound and magnetic resonance examinations without showing recurrence of hepatic neoplasm so far. She did not experience any new episodes of AF (indeed, she is under flecanide treatment until today), hormone thyroid values remained within normal ranges and no further treatment for thyroid dysfunction was necessary.

    "question": "A 58-year-old right-handed woman with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, IHD, and chronic kidney disease, on maintenance dialysis presented to the ICU from the dialysis unit when the doctors found her developing sudden onset of right-sided weakness after the completion of the dialysis. She was immediately assessed by a neurologist in the ICU, where she was found to have right-sided hemiplegia with right upper motor neuron facial palsy with dysarthria. Her pulse and blood pressure were stable. She was shifted for the CT brain scan immediately which revealed a hyperdense left middle cerebral artery (MCA) with old bilateral basal ganglia lacunar infarcts. She was diagnosed to have acute left MCA stroke with unknown mechanism and received IV tPA 80 minutes after the stroke.\nFollowing the infusion of IV tPA, the power of left arm and leg improved.Approximately two hours after the completion of tPA,she developed sudden onset of chest pain with cardiovascular collapse. Her blood pressure was 60 mm Hg systolic with pulse rate of 30/min. Immediately, she was started on inotropes. ECG revealed ST segment elevation in anterior leads. Intravenous atropine was started. A temporary pacemaker was inserted. Her troponin-T was sent which was elevated to 7.63. Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 15% with hypokinetic anterior and lateral wall. There was no cardiac thrombus.\nHer baseline ECG was reassessed which showed QS pattern in II, III, aVF indicating an old inferior wall myocardial infarction. Neurological examination revealed that she was unresponsive to verbal commands. Pupils were dilated bilaterally (3 mm) in size and reactive. She had a withdrawal response in her left arm and leg. The mechanism of myocardial injury was postulated to be thrombolytic mediated distal embolization of the proximal thrombus in the coronary arteries.

    "question": "We describe the case of an 18-year-old woman with chest pain radiating to the left arm at rest. Her past medical history was unremarkable, apart from Graves\u2019 disease on treatment with methimazole at a dosage of 5 mg/die. She came to our attention in 2020, when she was admitted to the emergency department (ED) for the onset of sharp chest pain radiated to the left arm and to the trapezius ridge. Pain was less severe when in a seated position and more severe when in a supine position, when breathing deeply or during coughing. No episodes of fever, diarrhoea, respiratory symptoms, or myalgia were reported in the previous days. In the ED, the pain was persistent; laboratory findings showed no significant abnormalities. In particular, cardiac markers, D-dimer, complete blood count, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were normal. The ECG () showed tachycardia at 128 b.p.m. and diffuse, concave (\u2018saddle-shaped\u2019) and non-specific ST-segment elevations in all leads except aVR and V1, and PR-segment depression except aVR. Analgesic drugs were administered and the patient was then hospitalized in the Cardiology Department for further diagnostic and therapeutic assessment. On physical examination, blood pressure was 141/63 mmHg and body temperature 36.5\u00b0C. On cardiac auscultation, S1 and S2 heart sounds were normal and no pathological murmur was reported; no friction rub was heard. Absence of jugular vein distension and no pulsus paradoxus was reported. Laboratory tests were repeated and showed no significant abnormalities: serum Beta 2 microglobulin, electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, and transaminases (ALT, AST) were normal and renal function was not impaired, thus ruling out uraemic pericarditis. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was suppressed (<0.0008 mIU/L, local lab normal reference range: 0.4\u20134 mIU/L) and serum-free thyroxine 4 was increased (61.24 pg/mL, reference range: 8\u201319 pg/mL); cardiac markers and acute-phase proteins were still negative. Antithyroid therapy was optimized, increasing methimazole dosage to 10 mg TID, and oral propanolol 10 mg TID was introduced. Laboratory tests for autoimmune diseases were performed and the antinuclear antibody panel, lupus anti-coagulant, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies were negative. Additionally, anti-mitochondrial (AMA, M2), anti-extractable nuclear antigens, anti-actin smooth muscle antibodies, and anti-Scl-70 (topoisomerase I) antibodies were negative, excluding systemic autoimmune and auto-inflammatory causes of pericardial diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma and vasculitis. Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (nasopharyngeal swab), Epstein\u2013Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, Enterovirus, Parvovirus B19, and Adenovirus were also negative, so that the main viral infectious causes of pericarditis were excluded. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (EF = 65%), absence of valvular diseases, no pericardial effusion, and normal right ventricular dimensions and function. Thoracic non-ECG-gated CT angiography was then performed () and acute aortic and pulmonary diseases were ruled out. The CT showed the presence of a pericardial effusion with slightly increased density (with radiological characteristic not consistent with blood nature) having a maximum thickness of 15 mm in the upper mediastinum. To characterize this effusion, gadolinium cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and the effusion turned out to be an extrapericardial mass of 73 \u00d7 51 mm () located in the upper mediastinum. A minimal pericardial effusion was found near the anterior mid-basal wall of the left ventricle where the mass had contact with the pericardium. The pericardium, however, showed no signs of infiltration by the mass and no late gadolinium enhancement was described. In view of this and in the absence of surrounding lymphadenopathies, the haematology specialist indicated biopsy of the mass, which was then performed through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Histological analysis showed true thymic hyperplasia and, from an anatomopathological point of view, prevalence of thymic cortex with various Hassall\u2019s bodies in the absence of lymphoid infiltration was described. After the improvement of the symptoms, the patient was discharged and ambulatory follow-up was planned. At the 1-month follow-up visit on 4 November 2020, the patient was asymptomatic, TSH levels were normal (3 mIU/L), anti-TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) were 10 IU/L (vs. 35.50 IU/L on admission; reference range <0.55 IU/L), and a 12-month cardiac MRI was planned.

    "question": "A 70-year-old Caucasian man with a previously diagnosed, IgG-kappa multiple myeloma presented with a 3-month history of worsening dyspnea, dysphagia, and weight loss. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was established one year prior to presentation with a serum kappa free light chain (K-FLC) level of 685 mg/dL and a lambda FLC level of 0.13 mg/dL (kappa/lambda (K/L) ratio of 5269). The patient had no lytic bone lesions or liver or heart involvement and had a normocellular bone marrow with 70% plasma cells. He was never noted to have macroglossia or albuminuria. His past medical history was otherwise notable for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease with Bence Jones proteinuria (K-FLC proteinuria of 691 mg/dL). Upon initial evaluation, the patient was hypoxic to 78% in room air. He appeared tachypneic, with an increased work of breathing and accessory muscle use. Auscultation revealed overall reduced breath sounds, bibasilar crackles, and an irregular cardiac rhythm with a holosystolic grade III/VI murmur loudest at the cardiac apex.\nThe patient's arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.31, a pCO2 of 60, and a pO2 of 60 mmHg. His labs otherwise revealed an bicarbonate of 33 mmol/L, a creatinine of 2.55 mg/dL (increased from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL), a hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 7.4 \u00d7 103 per \u03bcL. The patient also had a B-type natriuretic peptide level of 572 pg/mL and serial cardiac troponin I levels of 0.22, 0.22, and 0.21 ng/mL drawn 6 to 8 hours apart. His K-FLC level was 1379 mg/dL with L-FLC of 0.65 mg/dL (K/L-FLC ratio of 2121).\nA chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small bilateral pleural effusions. His echocardiogram was notable for elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 64 mmHg, biatrial dilatation with normal sized ventricles, and a preserved ejection fraction. A ventilation-perfusion scan was negative for acute or chronic pulmonary embolus.\nSubsequently, the patient was admitted to the cardiac stepdown unit for inotropic diuresis and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). After diuresis, a right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed PA pressure of 34/9/18 mmHg (systolic/diastolic/mean) and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10 mmHg.\nDespite effective diuresis, the patient went into a worsening hypercapnic respiratory failure with almost continuous dependence on NIPPV. His pulmonary function tests revealed restrictive physiology with FEV1 of 61%, FVC of 58%, and FEV/FVC of 104%. A subsequent nerve conduction study was suggestive of bilateral phrenic axonal neuropathy.\nWith his worsening dysphagia and respiratory muscle weakness, the course was further complicated by aspiration pneumonitis. A barium swallow esophagram showed narrowing of the gastroesophageal junction and tertiary contractions in the esophagus. An upper endoscopy was unrevealing and biopsy samples were negative for amyloidosis, confirmed by lack of Congo red staining (not shown). A fat pad biopsy was also negative for amyloid.\nDue to deteriorating cardiopulmonary and renal status, the patient was transferred to our cardiac intensive care unit. A repeat RHC was performed and a right ventricular biopsy was diagnostic of cardiac amyloidosis.

A physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation of the right lower abdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory data showed slight leukocytosis (WBC 8700/mm3) with slightly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP 0.43 mg/dL).\nA computed tomography (CT) image revealed a dilated cecum surrounded by free air, while the appendix was intact (). The preoperative diagnosis was perforation of the cecum. We planned to perform an urgent laparoscopic surgery.\nDuring the laparoscopy, the cecum was found to be dilated and discoloured ().\nAbout 10 h after symptoms onset, we performed a laparoscopic-assisted ileocecal resection. After the resection of the damaged intestine, extracorporeal end to end anastomosis was performed. The specimen revealed localized ischemic change on the anti-mesenteric side of the cecum (). Microscopically, the transluminal ischemic change was confirmed.\nThe lesion was diagnosed as isolated cecal necrosis. On day three postoperative, the patient developed a small intestinal perforation caused by sticking on the drainage tube, and he underwent ileostomy.

The patient had a history of head trauma in a driving accident six weeks before and had been hospitalized in Hamedan city, where she had undergone spiral brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast due to reduced consciousness. Brain CT scan reported right frontal contusion, right frontal bone fracture involving frontal sinus and filling of ethmoid sinuses. The patient had received treatment in that centre for one week and was discharged in good general condition. The patient did not report any history of seizures, otorrhoea, or rhinorrhoea during these six weeks.\nThe presenting vital signs of the patient were as follows: pulse rate: 88/minute, respiratory rate: 18/minute, blood pressure: 105/75 mmHg, axillary Temperature: 37.8\u00b0C, Glasgow coma scale (GCS): 13/15 (eye response = 3, motor response = 6, verbal response = 4). Pupils were symmetrical of 3 millimetres and reduced response to light was detected in the right pupil. The four limbs had equal force of 5/5. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were 2+ and symmetrical, and bilateral plantar reflex was symmetrical and downward. Other clinical examination findings were unremarkable.\nThe patient underwent brain CT scan again in our centre, which revealed hydropneumocephalus in the frontal parenchyma with midline shift and compression effect on the anterior horn of the lateral ventricles in the right frontal lobe (). Thus, the patient underwent treatment with phenytoin and 100% concentration oxygen. Moreover, given her mild fever and likelihood of brain abscess, a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Vancomycin) was administered until magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done. Neurosurgery emergency consultation was requested, and the patient was admitted to the Intensive care unit for further treatments. Considering the trend of recovery and at the neurosurgeon\u2019s discretion, the patient was a candidate for conservative non-surgical therapy. MRI with contrast on the third day of admission revealed no rim enhancement around the lesion, and confirmed the diagnosis of tension hydropneumocephalus (). Therefore, antibiotic was discontinued. On the seventh day, the patient was advised to continue taking oral phenytoin, and was discharged in good general condition. The patient reported no complications during the six-month follow-up.

Shortly after arrival of the medical team, she collapsed, and the cardiac monitorization showed ventricular fibrillation (VF) from which she was promptly defibrillated, and return of spontaneous circulation ensued. The electrocardiogram (ECG) after defibrillation showed sinus tachycardia with voltage criteria for left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy.\nAt the emergency room, blood pressure was 105/72 mmHg and a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur was heard at the left sternal border on cardiac auscultation. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin showed a slight elevation (0.045 ng/mL).\nTransthoracic echocardiographic evaluation revealed LV enlargement (112 mL/m2), mild LV hypertrophy (maximal wall thickness 12 mm), hypokinesia of the basal and mid segments of the anterior and anteroseptal walls, as well as of all distal segments, and moderately depressed LV function.\nThe patient underwent coronary CT angiography that showed an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). This was associated with a dilated right coronary artery (RCA) with extensive collateral network (Figure ). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging demonstrated subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement in the anterior wall and mid-distal anteroseptum, with transmural extension in the medium segment of anterior wall (Figure ). Furthermore, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) showed extensive peri-infarct ischemia involving anterolateral wall, middle segment of inferoseptal wall and distal segment of the inferior wall (Figure ).\nAn invasive coronary angiography was performed, and retrograde filling of the LCA territory through collaterals arising from an enlarged RCA was apparent (Figure ).\nDuring hospitalization the patient remained hemodynamically stable. She underwent surgical treatment by the creation of a poly-tetrahydrofuran (pTHF) conduct connecting the aorta and left coronary artery (Figure ). Communication between the main pulmonary artery and left coronary artery was closed with bovine pericardial patch.

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presented with insidiously progressing abdominal distension of one year\u2019s duration. Review of systems was significant for colicky abdominal pain, fatigue, night sweating and anorexia. The woman had no history of fever, jaundice, tuberculosis contact, weight loss or lower limb swelling. She was not on any medications. Her surgical history included laparoscopic gastric banding surgery for obesity (body mass index = 50; weight, 120 kg) 4 years earlier without complications. The patient had received normal saline injections through an injection port underneath the skin in the first 2 years after surgery to tighten the band. She had lost 50 kg since surgery. She was single, a graphic designer, and a smoker. Her menses were regular and there was no family history of malignancy. The patient\u2019s blood pressure on admission was 110/78 mmHg, her pulse was 82 bpm, her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and her temperature was 36.8\u00b0C. There were no palpable lymph nodes, pallor, jaundice, or other stigmata of chronic liver disease. Abdominal examination revealed a distended soft lax abdomen, a tender epigastrium on deep palpation with no guarding or rigidity, positive shifting dullness, and otherwise normal findings. Complete blood count and hepatic, coagulation and renal profiles were within normal limits and there was no proteinuria. Abdominal ultrasound showed moderate to severe ascites and normal liver size and echogenicity with a patent portal vein. Tumor marker CA 125 was high. Abdominal computed tomography showed large ascites with prominent ovaries bilaterally but no definitive mass or lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis was performed, draining 7 l. Fluid analysis showed low serum ascites albumin gradient. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Laparoscopic peritoneal and ovarian biopsies showed caseating granulomata without malignant cells or acid-fast bacilli. Acid-fast bacilli culture of the ascitic fluid and of peritoneal and ovarian biopsies grew Mycobacterium species in both Middlebrook 7H9 Broth (BACTEC MGIT 960 system) and Lowenstein-Jensen after one week of incubation. Colonies appeared smooth and greyish in Lowenstein-Jensen at a temperature of 28\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C with positive arylsulfatase test and negative ProbeTec ET test. The patient began treatment for rapidly growing Mycobacterium infection with clarithromycin, rifampicin, moxifloxacin and ethambutol. The isolate was identified by Line Probe Assay INNO-LiPA MYCOBACTERIA V2 (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) as M. chelonae complex /abscessus. The Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic used DNA sequencing and real-time PCR, per the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)\n[],to confirm that the isolate was M. abscessus, subspecies abscessus. Breakpoint susceptibility testing was performed using the CLSI recommended broth microdilution MIC method with nine drugs (amikacin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefoxitin, imipenem, linezolid, doxycycline/minocycline, clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin) [Table \n]. Breakpoints for tigecycline have not been evaluated by the CLSI for mycobacteria\n[]. The isolate was resistant to quinolones and rifampicin, and was susceptible to clarithromycin and amikacin. Rifampicin and moxifloxacin were discontinued and amikacin was started along with ethambutol and clarithromycin. Laparoscopic surgery for gastric band removal was performed. Significant inflammation with dense adhesions surrounding the entire band and black discoloration of the gastric band were noted during the procedure (Figure \n). Adhesiolysiswas performed and the band was removed. Tissue from the inflammation around the band showed granulomata and culture was positive for M. abscessus. Additional antimicrobials with potential activity against M. abscessus were added sequentially (imipenem, tigecycline and linezolid), but the patient could not tolerate them for various reasons. After 5 months of clarithromycin and ethambutol treatment supplemented with amikacin for the first 2 months, the patient had an excellent recovery and become completely asymptomatic.

    "question": "A previously healthy 26-year-old woman was referred to the Emergency Department with an influenza-like illness, which had started 2 days previously, and was associated with progressive disturbance of consciousness. Clinical examination was normal except for a blood pressure of 70/30 mmHg and a tachycardia of 120 beats/min. There was no response to a fluid challenge (1 L of colloid over 30 min). Central nervous system infection was ruled out by lumbar puncture and cerebral tomodensitometry. Her white blood cell count was 7,000 per \u03bcl and the procalcitonin concentration was not raised. EKG and chest radiography were normal. The first troponin measurement was 0.02 ng/mL.\nThe patient was transferred in a medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) under the diagnosis of probable septic shock. Fluid resuscitation (4 L of cristalloids during the 6 first hours) was followed by a daily continuous infusion of 3 L of cristalloids and norepinephrine infusion. Antibiotics were given: cefotaxime (4 \u00d7 2 g/day, erythromycin 3 \u00d7 1 g/day and gentamycin 1 \u00d7 400 mg/day), plus intravenous hydrocortisone (200 mg per day).\nFluid resuscitation produced no improvement in blood pressure. Degradation of the oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 < 120) requiring mechanical ventilation was observed. Her hemodynamic status rapidly deteriorated during the subsequent hours despite high doses of vasopressor (norepinephrine 5 mg/h). Diagnosis of cardiogenic shock was established by the association of severe hemodynamic compromise requiring high-dose of vasopressor, low right atrial oxygen saturation (45%) and transthoracic echocardiography showing a diffuse hypokinesia with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, elevated right and left filling pressures. Left ventricle diastolic dimensions were however normal (44 mm) as was septal thickness (8 mm). The troponin I concentration was 28 ng/mL. Monitoring by pulse contour analysis and thermodilution showed a cardiac index of 2.4 L/min/m2. Restriction of parenteral fluids and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration with fluid removal at an average rate of 300 ml/h substantially improved gas exchange. However, despite increased inotropic support (epinephrine 2 to 25 mg/h and dobutamine 12 \u03bcg/kg/min), the hemodynamic status further worsened and the multi-organ dysfunction syndrome became obvious (arterial lactate level at 10 mmol/L, alanine aminotransferase level of 293 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase level of 587 IU/L, bilirubin level of 21 mg/dL and progressive oliguria) (Table ).\nA circulatory support device was connected by percutaneous femoral vein and artery cannulation. Pump flow of 3500 rpm generated an output of 4 L/min and a non pulsatile systemic pressure of 80 mmHg. Intravenous heparin was given, aiming at an activated cephalin time of 60\u201380 secs. This procedure allowed rapid weaning of the inotropic support, and led to urine production and decreased lactacidemia (Table ).\nThe patient was transferred to a Cardiac ICU 24 hours later. Echocardiography showed lower left and right heart pressures, but the LVEF was persistently low at 20%. Multiple biopsies of the myocardium were performed. These latter, using routine staining, revealed interstitial inflammation and tissue destruction, but bacterial cultures remained negative. Real time polymerase chain reaction showed the presence of Influenza A RNA in the biopsy. Influenza A infection was confirmed by serologic tests and positive culture of the endotracheal aspirate. Liver function tests improved during circulatory support but there was anuric renal failure. On the 5th day of mechanical circulatory support, echocardiography showed improved diastolic and systolic function (LVEF of 50%) which allowed the progressive withdrawal of inotropic support. Mechanical circulatory support was reduced on the 6th day, and was withdrawn 24 hours later. The empiric antibiotherapy was stopped on the 7th day; she was extubated on the 13th, and vasopressor support was withdrawn on the 15th. Renal function recovered after 20 days of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. She was discharged on the 26th day with an LVEF of 70%, good diastolic function and no ventricular dilatation.

    "question": "A 15-year-old Caucasian male presented to the pediatrician\u2019s office with a 1-day history of intermittent suprapubic abdominal pain. The pain was described as 7/10 maximum severity but, after a single dose of acetaminophen, significantly improved (1/10 in severity). There was no fever, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, or diarrhea. The patient recalled passage of a normal soft bowel movement without blood or mucus the day prior. There were no recent sick contacts or dietary changes. He was afebrile and vital signs were normal. Physical exam revealed a well-appearing male with a soft, non-tender, and non-distended abdomen. Bowel sounds were hyperactive. Testicular exam was normal and the patient was able to maneuver on and off the exam table without significant discomfort. Urinalysis revealed ketones 40 mg/dL but was otherwise unremarkable. The patient was sent home with presumed acute viral gastroenteritis and instructions to take acetaminophen every 4 hours as needed and to seek medical care for persistent or worsening symptoms.\nTwo days later he reported to the pediatric emergency department with moderate suprapubic cramping abdominal pain with radiation to the bilateral flanks. There was associated nausea and 1 episode of non-bloody and non-bilious emesis. The patient had not had a bowel movement in 3 days. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 132/87, temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F), heart rate 87, and respiratory rate 16. Physical exam revealed an uncomfortable-appearing child with moderate tenderness in all 4 abdominal quadrants. Bowel sounds were hypoactive and there was moderate abdominal distention. A complete blood count, urinalysis, C-reactive protein, lipase, coagulation studies, and lactic acid were unremarkable. Complete metabolic panel was normal except for hyperglycemia (156 mg/dL). SARS-COV-2 by NAA was not detected. Abdominal radiograph revealed a markedly distended inverted U-shaped bowel loop sigmoid colon or \u201ccoffee bean sign\u201d (). Computed tomography with 100 cc of Omnipaque 350 intravenous contrast revealed marked gas distention of the sigmoid colon and a \u201cwhirlpool sign\u201d in the lower abdomen consistent with sigmoid volvulus ().\nA pediatric surgeon and pediatric gastroenterologist were consulted and jointly decided to attempt endoscopic reduction of the sigmoid volvulus with, should it become necessary, subsequent exploratory laparotomy. After obtaining informed consent and induction of general anesthesia, an Olympus PCF-H190DL colonoscope was passed under direct visualization through the anus to the sigmoid colon where the colonic mucosa demonstrated a twisted appearance (). Detorsion of the volvulus was achieved with careful insufflation and gentle pushing, and confirmed by passage of stool along with visualization of grossly dilated descending colon. Further inspection revealed normal mucosa; due to presence of stool, the colonoscopy was limited to the splenic flexure. A rectal tube was not placed during the procedure. The child was returned to the hospital ward in stable condition, tolerated standard advancement of the diet, and was discharged home the following day.

    "question": "A 44-year-old man, working in a chemical plant, was accidentally exposed to bromine gas (Br2). The worker became unconscious for 15 min and was transferred to an open-air setting by the colleagues, where the man gained consciousness after 10 min.\nUpon admission to a local hospital, the man presented with several symptoms, such as dyspnea, vomit, fatigue, cough, pharyngalgia, and mental confusion. The patient remained conscious with the following vital signs: blood pressure 92/63 mmHg, pulse rate 94 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, temperature 36\u00b0C, oxygen saturation (80\u201385%) supported by mask ventilator assisted ventilation with inhaled 100% oxygen concentration. Arterial blood gases obtained before intubation were: pH 7.309, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 8.18 kpa, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 6.73 kpa, and bicarbonate concentration \u22120.9 mmol/L (P/F oxygen ratio was 61.5 mmHg). Despite inhaling 100% oxygen, the status of dyspnea did not improve but progressively worsened accompanied with profuse sweating and irritability. Moreover, a pronounced stridor could be heard. The physical examination revealed cyanosis of the lips and mouth, shortness of breath, three concave signs, and increased bilateral vesicular sounds. Because of laryngeal edema caused by Br2 irritation and potential retention of secretions in the lower respiratory tract with a probable need for more than a week of respiratory support, a tracheotomy was performed immediately. A large amount of pinkish foamy secretions was discharged from the patient's mouth after tracheotomy. The clinical and laboratory investigations indicated that the pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) was less than 90% after assisted mechanical ventilation. A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema with fluid-filled bilateral lungs (). Subsequently, a single dose of methylprednisolone (80 mg) was administered intravenously. Considering the severity of the Br2-induced injury, the patient was transferred to critical care center 4 h after Br2 inhalation for definitive treatment.\nAt the critical care center, the patient received synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), with initial settings of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 1.0, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 bpm, tidal volume (VT) of 4 ml/kg, and plateau pressure (Pplat) \u2264 25 cmH2O. In addition to the routine critical care, initial management included absolute bed rest, intravenous methylprednisolone, anticoagulation, energy and vitamin supplements, maintenance of water, electrolytes, and acid-base balance. However, the condition of the patient worsened. Arterial blood gases recorded 48 h after mechanical ventilation were: pH 7.26, PaO2 6.13 kpa, PaCO2 4.97 kpa, and bicarbonate concentration 2.4 mmol/L (P/F oxygen ratio was 46 mmHg). Thereafter, the patient was initiated on ECMO. Two cannulas were placed percutaneously by vessel puncture, guidewire placement, and serial dilation. One cannula (Edward 24F, Edwards Lifesciences Corp., CA, USA) was advanced into the right femoral vein; another (Edward 16F) into the right internal jugular vein. The assembled circuit (PLS heparin-coated ECMO kit, Edward) was primed. Initial ECMO flow settings were: blood flow of 4 L/min, sweep gas flow of 2 L/min, FiO2 of 1.0, and temperature of the water bath was set at 36.8\u00b0C (adjusted according to arterial blood gas). The ventilator settings immediately pre-ECMO were: P-SIMV, PEEP 12 cmH2O, FiO2 0.5, RR 8 bpm, VT 4 ml/kg, Pplat \u2264 25 cmH2O. The patient was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam during cannulation and management for the first 12\u201324 h. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) was \u22125. The neurologic examination was performed daily to ensure that the sedation was sufficient. Once the patient had stabilized on ECMO, all the sedatives and narcotics were stopped and resumed depending on the levels of anxiety and discomfort of the patient. Heparin (50\u2013100 units per kg) was administered at the time of cannulation and continuously infused during ECMO. Heparin infusion was regulated to keep the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at designated levels (usually 1.5 times the normal values for the APTT measurement system). Hemoglobin levels, blood platelet counts, and lactic acid accumulation were regularly detected to monitor the development of complications. The rest settings during ECMO support were: Ppeak 20\u201325 cmH2O, PEEP 10\u201315 cmH2O, RR 10 bpm, and FiO2 0.4.\nIn addition to ECMO support, the pharmacologic diuresis and antibiotic treatment were administered. Respiratory parameters of the patient improved and the chest CT images showed that the bilateral infiltrations had regressed after 7 days of therapy. The patient was weaned off ECMO upon shock reversal and attaining stable condition. The arterial blood gases were analyzed when the patient was extubated: pH 7.47, PaO2 98.3 mmHg, PaCO2 38.7 mmHg, and SpO2 99%. The chest CT was performed on 2nd and 7th day after weaning (). It was found that the lung edema had resolved. Follow-up chest CT after discharge from the hospital showed progressive improvement in the affected lung regions.

    "question": "A 76-year-old Japanese man suffered from fever in April 2014. He had been receiving insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus and had been administered antiplatelet agent since the onset of cerebral infarction at age 60. On physical examination, his superficial lymph nodes, liver, and spleen were not palpable. Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count, 8.5 \u00d7 109/L with 0.5% abnormal lymphocytes; hemoglobin, 7.8 g/dL; platelet count, 79 \u00d7 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1,004 U/L (normal range, 124 - 226 IU/L); C-reactive protein (CRP), 19.02 mg/dL; and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level, 11,400 IU/mL. Bone marrow aspiration revealed proliferation of large abnormal lymphocytes with vacuoles. These cells were positive for CD19, CD20, and kappa and were negative for CD5, CD10, and lambda, as determined by flow cytometric analysis. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scans revealed abnormal accumulations in the spleen and bone marrow. He was diagnosed with B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Because of acute deterioration, chemotherapy had to be initiated despite the absence of a pathological definitive diagnosis with bone marrow biopsy. Eight courses of reduced-dose R-CHOP therapy, which consisted of rituximab (375 mg/m2 on day 1), doxorubicin (25 mg/m2 on day 2), cyclophosphamide (375 mg/m2 on day 2), vincristine (0.7 mg/m2 on day 2), and prednisone (50 mg/body on days 1 - 5), were administered every 3 weeks. CNS prophylaxis was not performed. Complete remission was confirmed by laboratory findings and PET/CT. Until April 2015, there were no findings that actively suggested relapse. His sIL-2R level had remained approximately 700 - 900 IU/mL and was 876 IU/mL at that time.\nIn May 2015, 3 days before admission, he could not recognize cards in a deck when playing by himself. Additionally, behaviors that his family could not understand became increasingly evident. On the day of admission, he moaned in the bedroom and then had generalized convulsions. He was transferred to our hospital in an ambulance while the convulsion persisted. On physical examination at emergency visits, tonic-clonic convulsions continued. His temperature was 40.5 \u00b0C, heart rate was 157 beats per minute, blood pressure was 187/79 mm Hg, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. His Glasgow coma scale score was E1V1M4. His pupils were round and equal with a slow light reflex. There was right conjugate deviation but no neck stiffness. The liver, spleen, and superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. The laboratory findings were as follows: WBC count, 15.1 \u00d7 109/L with no abnormal cells; hemoglobin, 9.9 g/dL; platelet count, 188 \u00d7 109/L; prothrombin time, 13.2 s; activated partial thromboplastin time, 27.2 s; fibrinogen, 417 mg/dL; D-dimer, 2.5 \u00b5g/mL; total protein, 7.0 g/dL; albumin, 4.5 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 24 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 11 U/L; LDH, 313 U/L; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 1.36 mg/dL; CRP, 0.75 mg/dL; HbA1c, 8.3%; and electrolytes and blood glucose levels were normal. Brain CT scan revealed a high-density tumor with edema and intratumoral hemorrhage in the left temporal lobes (). The tumor was iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hypointense on T2-weighted MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI (). In addition, gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging showed heterogeneous enhancement ().\nFor convulsion, diazepam and levetiracetam were initiated. Brain biopsy for definitive diagnosis was scheduled. However, convulsion frequently developed despite increased amounts of levetiracetam. His urinary tract infection was complicated, so antibiotics were started; however, his fever worsened. On the 24th hospital day, his LDH level drastically increased to 1,792 U/L and his CRP increased to 23.5 mg/dL. A few lymphoma cells were detected in the peripheral blood. Respiratory failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed. He died on the 27th hospital day.\nAutopsy was performed with the consent of his family and revealed DLBCL, which had infiltrated the brain, meninges, bone marrow, spleen, lung, retroperitoneum, adrenal gland, and lymph nodes. However, there was no macroscopically enlarged lymph node. Focal hemorrhage was observed in the left temporal lobe in which lymphoma cells had diffusely infiltrated with hemorrhage (). Lymphoma cells were observed in parts of the lung lesions within the lumina of vessels (). Lymphoma cells in the brain lesion were positive for CD20, CD79a, and PAX5 (), and those of other organs were negative for CD20 but positive for PAX5 ().

    "question": "A 23-year-old female was brought to the emergency department with complaints of recurrent high-grade fever, seizures and, altered mental state (AMS). She had been seeking treatment from a local practitioner for a previously diagnosed tuberculous pericardial effusion, which had not yet resolved. Her past medical history included iron deficiency anemia, stomatitis, right mastitis, and she had been on anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) for the past 45 days. She had a family history of tuberculosis but denied having diabetes, hypertension, or asthma. She had suffered five to six episodes of abnormal body movements and altered sensorium before being admitted to the hospital. On admission, she had a fever of 101 \u2109, tachycardia with 180 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, and low oxygen saturation of 85% on ambient air. The patient's hematological and biochemical parameters are shown in Table and Table respectively.\nOn physical examination, her lymph nodes were found to be tender and painful, and she had generalized LAP, involving the right-sided cervical, axillary, bilateral inguinal, and inter-trochanteric lymph nodes. The LAP had started as a swelling below the medial aspect of the right chin; the swelling had then progressed to the medial aspect of the right elbow and finally evolved to be generalized LAP. She also presented alopecia and malar rash. Her respiratory examination revealed the presence of bilateral crepitus. Her deep tendon reflexes were present but were depressed. Her CNS examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 (eye: 2, verbal: 2, motor: 4). Neck rigidity was also present. She was administered IV methylprednisolone. However, the LAP did not resolve. Later on, she was started on IV glucocorticoids and phenytoin, along with the continuation of ATT.\nThe patient's urine examination revealed proteinuria (total protein: 226.90 mg/dL; creatinine: 86.96 mg/dL; protein-creatinine ratio: 2.61), macroscopic hematuria with 15-20 red blood cells/high power field, and was indicative of lupus nephritis. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was suggestive of meningitis (total protein: 270.40 mg/dL; cell count: 10/mm3; all mononuclear and glucose: 56.21 mg/dL). Her MRI scan of the head revealed enhancements in the brain parenchyma, signifying inflammation and indicating lupus cerebritis (Figure ).\nHer chest X-ray revealed a bilaterally enlarged cardiac silhouette (Figure ), which raised suspicion for pericardial effusion. Her subsequent echocardiography confirmed our suspicion. Her anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) was positive, and the anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) was negative. Her immunofluorescence assay of pericardial fluid was positive for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) with cytoplasmic dense fine-speckled pattern and intensity of 2+ (mildly positive) with a dilution of 1:80. In light of these findings, we concluded that her pericardial effusion was a complication of SLE rather than one caused by tuberculosis as diagnosed earlier by her local practitioner. According to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2019 diagnostic criteria for SLE, a score of 10 or more must be considered as indicative of SLE. In our case, the score was 37, which is much more than what is needed to satisfy the criteria.\nEven though the patient responded well to the treatment initially, she succumbed to the disease after one week of treatment.

    "question": "A 27-year-old man without any significant medical history, presented to the emergency department (ED) with right lower abdominal pain and a fever of 38.7 \u00b0C A computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis showed a perforated appendix (). Emergency laparotomy was performed and the patient underwent appendectomy and washout. He was discharged home three days later.\nOn postoperative day 12, the patient was presented again to the ED with a septic shock with a pain of right flank. The vital signs at presentation were as follows: GCS 11/15; blood pressure 110/65 mmHg; pulse 110\u2013120 beats/min; respiratory rate 25 breaths/min and body temperature 39 \u00b0C. Physical examination showed right thigh tenderness with a moderately erythematous abdomen and subcutaneous emphysema. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 25000/mm\u00b3 with 90% neutrophil forms; hemoglobin 13 g/dL; Creatinine 65 \u03bcmol/L; C-reactive protein was 200 mg/dL and serum lactate level 4.9 mmol/L\nA new surgical exploration was performed after appropriate resuscitation with intravenous fluids and antibiotic, revealed a purulent peritonitis with necrotizing fasciitis involving the right lower abdomen, right psoas muscle and right retroperitoneum. Culture of the necrotic tissues revealed polymicrobial infection consisting of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nPostoperatively, the patient stayed intubated in the surgical intensive care unit and had mild hemodynamic instability requiring low-dose of noradrenaline. Antibiotics (Vancomycin 20 mg/kg/24 h, Tazobactam-Piperacillin 80 mg/kg every 6 h, Amikacin 15 mg/kg/24 h, metronidazole 40 mg/kg) were administered and the patient received repeated debridement for the unhealed abdominal wound. In addition, incision, drainage and hyperbaric treatments were performed three times for the necrotizing soft tissue infections over the retroperitoneal region of the right flank and also over the scrotal region and the external genital organ because of the extension of the necrosis. One week later, the patient developed another septic shock due to the extension of the necrosis to the right chest wall. A CT scan of the chest showed right-sided pleural effusion with erosive aspect of the ribs (). Necrotic tissues were debrided and antibiotic was changed due to wound superinfection with Acinetobacter Baumannii (Coli-mycin 100,000 UI/kg/24 h, rifampicin 30 mg/kg/24 h). After the improvement of his general health, skin flaps were putted by plastic surgeon to cover the exposed ribs ().\nOn the sixty postoperative day, the patient developed a mitral valve infective endocarditis with negative blood culture. Three days later, he died of septic shock and multiple organ failure. What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?",

    "question": "A confused 41-year-old male was found in a park and brought to emergency department by the paramedics. During transit he had two generalized seizures. On the admission the patient appeared confused but conscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 13. He behaved aggressively and spoke neither English nor a local language. An interpreter was consulted, but the patient showed aggressive behaviour, therefore making it impossible to take a history. The physical examination was unremarkable except for a tongue bite and several bruises and scratches over the whole body. The pupils were moderately dilated and sluggishly reactive. All vital signs were stable (heart rate: 108 beats per minute, blood pressure: 123/80 mmHg, oxygen saturation: 98% at room air with a normal respiratory rate, and a body core temperature of 37.2\u00b0C). Laboratory tests revealed a leukocytosis of 25.1 G/L, elevated values for C-reactive protein (12 mg/L), creatinine kinase (2185 U/L), myoglobin (618 \u03bcg/L), creatinine (143 mmol/L), and uric acid (1344 mmol/L) suggesting renal insufficiency. Electrolytes, liver enzymes, troponin I, coagulation, and haematology were in the normal range. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia. Neurology service was consulted because of ongoing confusion and for assessment of epilepsy. A cranial CT scan ruled out haemorrhage or other focal lesions. Lorazepam (2 mg, IV) was administered twice with no effect on his neurological status. The patient started to sweat and became hypertensive (systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg) and more tachycardic (heart rate of 140/min). A drug screening (Triage 8) was performed, which was positive for cocaine. Finally he admitted the cocaine consumption but refused to give further information. Benzodiazepines as well as phentolamine were given. In order to further investigate the drug intoxication a plain abdominal dual-energy CT scan was requested. Four round, hyperdense, foreign bodies were found in the transverse colon ().\nAn emergency laparotomy was indicated and carried out immediately. Following colotomy four packages () were removed. Thorough exploration revealed no further packages. The procedure took 60 minutes and postoperatively the patient was on observation for 24 h in the intensive care unit. The neurological signs as well as the renal insufficiency improved rapidly under conservative therapy. The further clinical course was unremarkable, and the patient was discharged six days after surgery. What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?",

    "question": "A 92-year-old female with a medical history notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease who presented to the ED with altered mental status, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain of one-day duration. She described diffuse, nonradiating abdominal pain that was crampy in nature, rated 5/10 in intensity, and associated with two episodes of nonbloody and nonbilious emesis. On admission, physical examination was remarkable for elevated blood pressure (188/79 mmHg), but an otherwise preserved heart rate and oxygen saturation. The abdominal examination demonstrated mild discomfort on palpation of the lower abdomen, but no evidence of rebound or guarding. Laboratory workup (Table ) was remarkable for leukocytosis (19.2 k/uL), an elevated lactate (4.7 mmol/L), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (79 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (60 mm/hour), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (281 U/L), creatine kinase (CK) (738 U/L). CT scan of the head and chest radiograph demonstrated no acute abnormalities. CT scan of the chest was subsequently performed and revealed an irregular mass-like area of ground-glass density in the left upper lobe (Figure ). Given the patient\u2019s overall clinical presentation and elevated inflammatory markers, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was collected to rule out COVID-19, which ultimately demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 positivity. The patient\u2019s hospital course was complicated by multiple episodes of watery diarrhea for which additional diagnostic workup - stool ova and parasites, stool culture, and Clostridium difficile - was ordered and found negative. The patient was treated with supportive care (IV hydration, electrolytes monitoring) and antibiotics which resulted in symptomatic improvement 16 days following presentation and 17 days following onset of symptoms.

Two (2) years later, skin eruptions spread all over his body. At that time, he was diagnosed with psoriasis and prescribed topical clobetasol propionate. He had not been reexamined after that and has been using clobetasol propionate 0.005% routinely for 10 years. He has applied the drug to his arms, legs, and all over the trunk. Over the past year, he put on weight obviously (8 kg). He stopped the treatment 1 month ago, at the time of writing. He has been complaining of dry mouth and fatigue for the last month. On his physical examination, moon face, central adiposity, and purple-red striae on the abdomen under umbilicus were observed. There were scaly patches and erythematous plaques on the skull, interscapular area, sacrum, arms, legs, knees, and elbows []. Other systemic examinations were all normal. Blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg, pulse 75/min, height 1.76 m, weight 77 kg, and body mass index 24.8 kg/m2. On laboratory examination, fasting blood glucose: 152 mg/dL (N: 70-105), creatinine: 1 mg/dL (N: 0.72-1.25), triglyceride: 160 mg/dL (N: 0-200), total cholesterol: 240 mg/dL (N: 0-200), high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol: 44 mg/dL (N: 45-55), low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol: 164 mg/dL (N: 0-130), ALT: 42 u/L (N: 0-55); AST: 27 u/L (N: 0-34); sodium: 140 mmol/L (N: 136-145); potassium: 4.6 mmol/L (N: 3.5-5.1); calcium: 9.9 mg/dL (N: 8.4-10.2); phosphorus: 3.5 mg/dL (N: 2.3-4.7); albumin: 4.6 g/dL (N: 3.2-5.2); intact-parathyroid hormone (iPTH): 38 pg/mL (N: 14-72); 25-OH Vitamin D: 4.9 ng/mL (N: 24-50); white blood cell (WBC) count: 12.76-103 /uL (N: 4.23-9.07); hemoglobin (Hb) count: 14.7 gr/dL (N: 13.7-17.5); platelet: 217-103 /uL (N: 150-400); morning (8 AM) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): 5.6 pg/mL (N: 0-46); morning (8 AM) serum cortisol: <0.2 \u03bcg/dL (5.5 nmol/L) (N: 4.3-22.4). According to these findings, the patient was diagnosed with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome secondary to topical steroid use. For adrenal insufficiency, 20 mg/day hydrocortisone treatment was commenced, and for vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D replacement. As the patient had high blood glucose levels, dyslipidemia, and large waist circumference (101 cm), he was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, and a low-calorie diet and exercise were advised. Metformin treatment at a dose of 2000 mg/day was commenced for glucose regulation. The patient consulted at the dermatology department for his psoriasis, and calcipotriol pomade and emollients were prescribed. One (1) month after that, 1 \u03bcg tetracosactide i.v. was applied and cortisol levels were measured at 30 min and at 60 min.

    "question": "A 62-year-old man presented to his local hospital after 1 month of mucous and bloody stool and 2 weeks of worsening abdominal pain. He had leukocytosis (1.4 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL), thrombocytopenia (6.4 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL), and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN; 71 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (2.56 mg/dL) levels. The patient was admitted with a suspicion of sepsis secondary to intraabdominal infection, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy was initiated. However, his condition deteriorated, and after 7 days, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Chiba University Hospital.\nOn admission to the ICU, the 165.3 cm tall patient weighing 99.3 kg was fully conscious (Glasgow Coma Scale E4V5M6), but he had a tendency to somnolence. His blood pressure was 154/103 mm Hg, heart rate 115/minutes, respiratory rate 30/minutes, body temperature 37.9 \u00b0C, and SpO2 96% on room air. The conjunctiva and skin were icteric. The chest was clear to auscultation. There was abdominal distention with mild hypogastric tenderness but no sign of peritoneal irritation. There was pitting edema in the upper and lower extremities. The white blood cell count was 1.2 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein level was 23.9 mg/dL, and procalcitonin level was 8.92 ng/mL, which were consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial infection. The platelet count had dropped to 3.8 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL, and the prothrombin time was 41% with a fibrin degradation product level of 53.1 \u03bcg/mL, indicative of coagulopathy. The lactate dehydrogenase level was 392 IU/L, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were 50 and 17 IU/L, respectively, and also total and direct bilirubin levels were 6.2 and 4.6 mg/dL, respectively; however, other indicators of hemolysis, including anemia and schistocytosis, were absent. The BUN had increased to 92 mg/dL and the creatinine level was stable at 2.09 mg/dL. The CH50 level was 40.6 U/mL (normal range: 30\u201350 U/mL), the C3 level was 85 mg/dL (normal range: 65\u2013135 mg/dL), and the C4 level was 23 mg/dL (normal range: 13\u201335 mg/dL).\nThe patient's clinical course is summarized in the Fig. . Since a stool culture test on ICU admission identified Enterococcus species and Corynebacterium striatum, a diagnosis of severe sepsis derived from bacterial enteritis was established and wide-spectrum antimicrobial therapy was initiated. Continuous hemodiafiltration was initiated on ICU day 3 but oliguria progressed to anuria, thrombocytopenia persisted, and laboratory values did not improve. Blood, urine, and spinal fluid cultures taken on admission to the ICU were all negative, which eliminated the possibility of additional foci of infection. Two polyps (one each in the sigmoid colon and the rectum) were discovered on lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, which were diagnosed at histopathology as early-stage nonhemorrhagic adenocarcinoma. The polyps did not appear to be the cause of the bloody stool. Additional laboratory evaluations were negative for other hematological disorders or connective tissue diseases. On ICU day 9, schistocytosis (0.5%) was noted on the peripheral blood smear, and a diagnosis of TMA was established. The Hct level also had dropped to 23.5% on the same day and the declining trend continued, therefore red blood cell transfusion was performed days later when he complained dyspnea. Plasma exchange (PE) therapy was initiated on ICU day 11. The patient had only a slight remission of thrombocytopenia after a total of 8 PE sessions (2.1 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL before the 1st PE and 5.9 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL after the 8th PE), but there was no notable clinical improvement and the anuria persisted (Fig. ). The level of ADAMTS13 activity in a plasma sample collected from the patient prior to initiation of PE was 25.1%, and the sample was negative for ADAMTS13 inhibitor. These findings eliminated the possibility of TTP. Furthermore, the stool was negative for Shiga toxin-producing-strains of Escherichia coli, and the serum titer for anti-Shiga-toxin antibody was also negative, eliminating the possibility of HUS. Although we considered TMA secondary to colorectal cancer in the differential diagnosis, the endoscopic findings of intramucosal carcinoma and negativity for tumor markers eliminated this possibility. Careful consideration of other possible causes, previous history, and drug history failed to identify an extrinsic etiology of TMA in this patient, and we ultimately suspected aHUS as the cause. Accordingly, intravenous eculizumab treatment (900 mg, once a week) was initiated on ICU day 26. An increase in urine output was observed on the next day, and renal support was successfully discontinued on the same day. And also marked recovery of the platelet count was obtained in combination with the effectiveness of supportive therapy including PE. Biweekly eculizumab infusion was repeated 4 times and then discontinued.\nAfter approval by the institutional review boards of Chiba University, the University of Tokyo, and National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, an anticomplement factor H (CFH) antibody assay and an analysis of complement factor H-related (CFHR) genes were performed using a blood sample collected from the patient prior to initiation of PE. Also written informed consent was obtained from the patient before the assays. The anti-CFH antibody level was 6.16 AU/mL, which indicated negativity for anti-CFH antibody. We performed the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to screen the copy numbers of CFHR1/3 on chromosome 1q32 using a commercially available kit (MLPA kit P236-A2; MRC-Holland, The Netherlands),[ and found that CFHR1/3 did not show gene deletions. However, moderate hemolysis was induced in concomitant hemolytic assays using sheep red blood cells (RBCs), and analysis for mutations potentially associated with aHUS identified a nonsynonymous mutation (p.Ala311Val) in the gene encoding membrane cofactor protein (MCP). All screened genes are presented in the Table .\nThe patient was discharged from the ICU on day 37 and was discharged to home on day 58. He was followed up regularly as an outpatient and was receiving 40 mg/day of prednisolone. At approximately 1 year after discharge, the patient remained in stable condition without relapse or resumption of eculizumab therapy. What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?",

    "question": "A three-year-old female with a history of complex congenital heart disease and previous cardiac surgeries was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in shock that progressed to cardiopulmonary arrest requiring resuscitation due to thrombosis in her right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit. She subsequently demonstrated evidence of severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and acute kidney injury (AKI), of which the latter resolved.\nThe main reason for her subsequent PICU stay was for neurological rehabilitation and transition to home ventilation. She was receiving treatment for dystonia, heart failure, endocarditis, and pulmonary embolism. At the request of the parents, stem cell therapy for neurological dysfunction was investigated. As metformin has shown properties to recruit existing neural stem cells and enhance neural functions, a trial of therapy was initiated. The patient was placed on metformin (20 mg/kg) 17 days before the event, which was increased to 40 mg/kg (250 mg twice-daily) six days prior to the event.\nOn the day of the event, the patient acutely presented with a new wide complex bradycardia 70\u201380 beats per minute (bpm) from a baseline of 110\u2013120 bpm and peaked T waves. The other vital signs were blood pressure = 90/40 mmHg, respiratory rate = 26 breaths per minute, temperature = 37.2 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation = 87% on her baseline ventilation settings. She was poorly perfused with prolonged capillary refill time and lethargic. Immediate and subsequent venous blood sampling showed severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia [].\nShe was managed for hyperkalemia, and propranolol was discontinued. She became hypotensive, requiring dopamine and norepinephrine infusions, and higher ventilator support. The patient\u2019s clinical status improved within three hours, and support therapies were weaned towards the baseline. Twelve hours after the initial event, a similar episode recurred with a rise in serum lactate and hyperkalemia, which was treated similarly and resolved. A detailed review of both events demonstrated that they occurred 1 to 2 hours after the administration of metformin. In addition, her creatinine levels had doubled five days prior to the event with a recent increment in metformin dose six days before.\nAt this point, metformin was discontinued. No further episodes were noted, and her clinical status returned to baseline []. What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?",

    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of confusion, agitation, and \u201crestless, swollen legs.\u201d Her past medical history included gastric bypass surgery, depression, and previous alcohol abuse. Regular medications were fluoxetine, omeprazole, and cetirizine. On initial assessment in the emergency room she was tachycardic at 102 beats per minute, her blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, and her chest was clear to auscultation with an SpO2 of 100% on room air. She was confused, with a GCS score of 10 (E3V2 M5), but with no focal neurological abnormalities or rash. Her temperature was 37.5\u00b0C and blood sugar was 5.6 mmol/L. Due to her confusion and agitation, sedation was given and a CT brain scan performed. This demonstrated no acute abnormality. A lumbar puncture was performed and treatment for CNS infection instituted with ceftriaxone and acyclovir. Her potassium was 1.9 mmol/L (3.6\u20135.0 mmol/L), sodium 146 mmol/L (136\u2013145 mmol/L), phosphate 0.57 mmol/L (0.8\u20131.4 mmol/L), and chloride 122 mmol/L (96\u2013106 mmol/L). Her renal function was otherwise normal with a urea of 2.7 mmol/L (2.5\u20136.6 mmol/L) and creatinine 56 \u03bcmol/L (60\u2013120 \u03bcmol/L). An arterial blood gas (FiO2 0.40) demonstrated a compensated metabolic acidosis: H+ 38.6 nmol/L, PaCO2 3.5 kPa, PaO2 24.44 kPa, HCO3 18.8 mmol/L, BE 8.2 mmol/L, Lactate 1.13 mmol/L. An ECG showed ST segment depression and U-waves but no ectopic beats or arrhythmias.\nOn further questioning, the patient's family suggested that she may have been taking large amounts of Nurofen Plus, as this had been an issue previously.\nDue to her confusion and profound biochemical abnormalities she was admitted to the intensive care unit for further management.\nHer management on ITU involved invasive monitoring and correction of the biochemical abnormalities. During the initial 48 hours in hospital she received 509.5 mmol of intravenous potassium replacement, which increased the serum potassium to 4.8 mmol/L. Phosphate replacement was given and once the serum potassium level had improved, 1.26% sodium bicarbonate was used as maintenance intravenous fluid. With the correction of her biochemical abnormalities (), her neurological function improved to GCS 15 (E4V5 M6). The biochemical abnormalities in the serum and urine suggested a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis with a serum anion gap of 9 mmol/L, urinary anion gap of 20 mmol/L, and transtubular potassium gradient of 11.37. On improvement of her symptoms and conscious level, the patient admitted to taking large amounts of Nurofen Plus tablets (20\u201340 per day) during the preceding weeks.

    "question": "A 19-year-old man presented to the orthopedic surgery department with pain in the left buttock after military training which including running with hyper-flexion of hip for 3 hours, twice a day for 5 days. When he hyper-flexed his left hip joint, he felt and heard a crack. Initially about one week later, he referred to the local hospital because of persisting hip pain. On radiographic evaluation, he diagnosed as pelvic bone fracture and recommended for further evaluation. However, he refused to get more examination due to the alleviation of the hip pain. Although he got rest without any military training for the next six weeks, there was no improvement and tingling sense developed over the posterior aspect of left thigh. During the first consultation with the patient, he complained difficulty on sustained standing and sitting on a locked position.\nHis body weight, height, hip and lumbar T-score for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan were 76 kg, 183 cm, \u20130.7 and \u20130.1 respectively. On physical examinations, there was no limitation on range of motion of the left hip joint. Also he could walk without any pain except mild tenderness on the area distal from the ischial tuberosity. On the radiographs of the pelvis anteroposterior and frog leg view (), there was a 35\u00d740\u00d720 mm sized bony fragment, 15 mm distance from the left ischial tuberosity. After the patient admitted to our hospital, he had an examination of computed tomography () and magnetic resonance imaging for rule out pathologic conditions. There was a bony fragment at left ischial tuberosity, which was mainly from conjoined origin of biceps femoris and semitendinosus tendons without any bone marrow edema (). Overall, he diagnosed as old avulsion fracture at ischial tuberosity. He determined to get conservative treatment on condition of a gradual alleviation of the symptom. During the admitted 2 months, he just got rest and high intensity laser therapy. Thanks to the improvement except discomfort on running, he discharged and returned to his military unit.

    "question": "A 54-year-old female (weight 55 kg, 160 cm) was referred by an orthopedic surgeon to our pain clinic for persistent low back pain radiating down to right leg. She had a history of low back pain associated with radiculopathy, which was more on the right side and radiated till the big toe for more than 6 weeks. The impression on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right paracentral disc protrusion at levels L4-L5, L5-S1 causing thecal sac indentation, effacement of the right lateral recess and right exiting nerve root impingement. There was no associated lumbar canal stenosis and no evidence of facet arthropathy. She had been taking analgesics tablet diclofenac 650 mg, tablet pregabalin 75 mg, tablet nortriptyline 10 mg, and regular physiotherapy for the last 6 weeks. She even underwent an epidural steroid injection (ESI) through the caudal route with 4 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine, 1 ml of methylprednisolone, and 5 ml of normal saline at a tertiary care center 4 weeks back after which her symptoms improved marginally for a period of 1 week and then she again started with debilitating pain, not getting relieved with analgesics and other modes of conservative management. The complete motor and sensory examination of the patient revealed motor power of Grade V, i.e. the muscle can move the joint; it crosses through a full range of motion against gravity and resistance. The sensations were intact as elicited by pain, temperature, vibration, position sense, stereognosis, and two-point discrimination. All the superficial and deep tendon reflexes were intact with an SLR of 10\u00b0 on the right side and 70\u00b0 on the left side. The patient had full control over the bladder and bowel.\nWe hence planned, fluoroscopic-guided transforaminal ESI (TFESI) using clonidine as an adjuvant at levels L4-L5 and L5-S1 on the right side, after discussing both with the patient and the orthopedic surgeon.\nAfter taking an informed written consent, an 18-gauge intravenous cannula was secured. All routine monitors (electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) were attached. The patient was positioned on the operating room table with a pillow underneath the abdomen in the prone position. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the standard safe triangle was identified with pedicle of the vertebrae forming one arm of the triangle, lateral border of vertebral body forming the second arm, and the hypotenuse being formed by the exiting nerve root. Under all aseptic precautions, the skin overlying the target area was anesthetized with 2 ml of 1% lidocaine. The level of the epidural injection was chosen depending on the MRI findings and physical examination as L4- L5 and L5-S1.\nA 22-gauge spinal needle was then advanced under fluoroscopy aiming the needle at the superior and anterior part of the intervertebral foramen through the safe triangle. The needle placement was confirmed after injecting 1\u20132 ml of omnipaque, nonionic water-soluble contrast medium iohexol dye, demonstrating the contrast going through the foramen. Furthermore, the confirmation of the needle position with contrast dye reduced the possibility of misplacement or intravascular placement of the needle, which is always a risk in ESIs performed without fluoroscopy. The needle was advanced into the safe triangle, and its placement was then confirmed both by anteroposterior and lateral view. One milliliter methylprednisolone (40 mg) mixed with 0.5 ml clonidine (50 \u03bcg) and 1 ml bupivacaine 0.5% were given at each level (volume 2.5 ml).\nAfter the completion of the procedure, the patient was transferred to the recovery area. The patient's hemodynamic parameters were monitored during and after the procedure. Assessment of pain relief and any motor or sensory deficit was checked immediately and then hourly after the procedure till discharge from the recovery area.\nThe patient was discharged after having met the following discharge criteria after 2 h:\nThe patient was able to walk unaided The patient was able to void her bladder without any difficulty.\nShe was assessed for any numb or weak feeling in her back or legs for a few hours after the injection.\nAfter 24 h, the patient was discharged from the hospital, and there was a significant improvement in the pain with an improvement in the SLR to 60\u00b0.\nFollowing instructions were given at the time of discharge:\nTo report any untoward incident To continue taking analgesics as advised To start back muscle strengthening exercises after 3 days if there was considerable pain relief.\nPatient was then reassessed at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months interval after the procedure. There was a significant improvement in the pain after single injection of TFESI using clonidine as depicted by the visual analog scale (VAS) score; there was a much reduced drug dose intake and an improvement in the daily life activities as stated by the patient.

    "question": "A 35-year old primigravida (height 150 cm; weight 60 kg) presented with exertional dyspnea at 23 weeks of gestation. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary artery thrombi and deep venous thrombus in the lower limb (Fig. ). A transthoracic echocardiography revealed a right ventricular thrombus (Fig. ). She was referred to our hospital at 28 weeks of gestation after insertion of IVC filter and heparin administration. Fetal development was normal. Due to the mobility of right ventricular thrombus and the risk of cardiac arrest, an emergency thrombectomy was planned. An intracardiac echography probe (AcuNav\u2122; Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) was inserted via the right femoral vein to monitor the umbilical artery pulse wave via Doppler, in addition to transabdominal fetal monitoring. After induction of anesthesia, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was undetectable; hence, emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed via median sternotomy, followed by cardiac resuscitation. While switching to extracorporeal circulation approximately 10 min after the hemodynamic collapse, the fetal heart rate decreased to approximately 80 beats per minute. Immediately after establishing extracorporeal circulation, the fetal heart rate recovered rapidly and remained stable throughout the procedure, while the CPB average perfusion pressure was maintained above 70 mmHg. Thrombectomy and tricuspid valve plication were performed under cardiac arrest (Fig. ). Catecholamines and nitric oxide were administered at a concentration of 20 ppm to treat hypotension and pulmonary hypertension, respectively, during withdrawal from CPB. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit without chest closure. Total time for surgery, anesthesia, cardiopulmonary, and aortic cross clamp was 345, 483, 208, and 147 min, respectively. The total volume of hemorrhage, transfusion, infusion, urine, and water balance was 1470, 3600, 2150, 1520, and +657 ml, respectively. Chest closure was performed on postoperative day 3 and extubation on postoperative day 6. Heparin administration was resumed after confirming postoperative hemostasis. At 32 weeks of gestation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to assess the fetal brain function; no remarkable changes were observed. The patient was discharged with subcutaneous injection of heparin calcium, due to persistent lower limb thrombus.\nShe was readmitted at 38 weeks of gestation. Labor was induced at 40 weeks using oxytocin, after discontinuation of heparin. Epidural anesthesia was administered to protect the thoracic wound site and reduce the cardiac load. An epidural catheter was placed between the L3-L4 vertebrae, after confirming the recovery of hemostatic function by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time. Continuous epidural ropivacaine 0.1% with 2 mcg/ml fentanyl was administered through patient controlled epidural analgesia. Analgesia was adequate throughout labor, with no hemodynamic changes. A healthy male infant weighing 3446 g (+1.07 SD) was delivered by vacuum extraction with an Apgar score of 8/8. Total delivery time was 3 h and 37 min, with total blood loss of 928 ml. No remarkable changes were observed in the neonate\u2019s brain on CT and MRI just after delivery.

The patient and her family\u2019s medical histories were unremarkable.\nThe patient was 157 cm tall and weighed 53 kg. Physical examination of the right breast (area C) revealed an elastic hard mass measuring 2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm. Margins were distinct, with relatively good mobility and a tumor-nipple distance of 3.2 cm. No axillary or cervical lymph nodes were palpable. Hematological and biochemical blood test results were normal. The levels of tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 15-3, and National Cancer Center-Stomach-439, were within normal limits.\nMammography revealed an indistinct margined hyper dense mass in the right outer portion, which was assessed as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System category 4C (: MLO view, : CC view). Breast ultrasonography (US) revealed complex cystic lesion, and the tumor was large with 2.5 cm diameter (). Complex cystic lesion on US with blood content on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology revealed malignant cells. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and a T2 weight image revealed an early enhancement image with no intraductal spread (). No distant metastases was identified on computed tomography or bone scan. The tumor stage was T2N0M0. Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed.\nThe results exposed two sentinel lymph nodes and no malignant cell. The tumor measured 2.0 cm in diameter and contained a central cystic area (,). Histopathological examination showed low papillary growth in the cystic cavity surface, which was covered by adenocarcinomatous components associated with some squamous metaplasia. Most of the lesions comprising the cyst wall were a mixture of irregular bundles of spindle-shaped tumor cells and fibrous connective tissue proliferation. The tumor was diagnosed as spindle cell ().\nImmunostaining of spindle-shaped tumor cells showed positive results for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin (,), partially positive results for s-100, and negative results for desmin and \u03b1-actin. The final histopathological diagnosis was spindle cell carcinoma. Histological grade from malignancy was grade III. Lymphatic invasion was negative, whereas blood vessel invasion was positive. Lymph node metastasis was negative, and p-stage I was diagnosed. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), which showed negative results by biochemical tests, were called triple negative type in subtype classification. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient received six courses of FEC-100 chemotherapy. Radiotherapy included simultaneous integrated boost enforced 60 Gy (2 Gy/day) to the residual breast tissue. After 24 months of postoperation, no recurrence has been detected.

Her personal medical history was unremarkable, without any previous disease or operation. This multipara patient was 155 cm tall, and weighed 40 kg. Her vital signs were as follows: ABP: 120/70 mmHg, pulse rate: 78/min, respiratory rate: 23/min, body temperature: 36.7\u00b0C. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension without abdominal guarding, and rebound tenderness. The rectal ampulla was empty on digital rectal examination. Other system examinations were unremarkable. Results of laboratory tests were as follows: Htc: 43.1%; WBC: 11700/mm3, glucose: 125 mg/dL, BUN: 61mg/dL, creatinine: 1.21 mg/dL, sodium: 135 mEq/L, potassium: 4.3 mEq/L. Standing KUB revealed air-fluid level of intestines (). On whole abdominal ultrasound, dilated intestinal loops, and free fluid between intestinal loops were detected. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated obstructive obturator hernia on the left side (Figures , ). The patient was operated urgently with the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction caused by strangulated obturator hernia. On exploration, a strangulated intestinal loop was detected within the left obturator channel, and reduced. Intestinal ischemia, necrosis or perforation were not detected, so additional intervention was not performed. The defect was repaired using a polypropylene mesh placed in the preperitoneal region. The patient was lost on postoperative 3rd day because of acute respiratory failure. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m\u00b2.",

    "question": "A 51-year-old Caucasian left-handed housewife lady (weight 61 kg, height 159 cm) was admitted to our institution because of severe sudden onset headache followed by transient loss of consciousness and vomiting. On examination she was fully conscious and oriented and complained of severe headache. Nuchal rigidity was evident. No focal neurological deficit was found. Temperature was 38\u00b0C and other vital signs were stable. Past medical history was negative and she did not consume any medication.\nCT scan of the head revealed acute subarachnoid hemorrhage prominently occupying the right sylvian fissure. CT angiography was performed (figure ). The cerebral vasculature was found to harbor three saccular aneurysms at: (1) right MCA trifurcation, (2) left ICA bifurcation, and (3) distal basilar artery. The right MCA aneurysm was presumed to be the ruptured aneurysm due to location of subarachnoid clot and irregular shape of the aneurysm.\nA right pterional craniotomy was performed with the patient in the supine position and head rotated 30 degrees to left. After elevation of the craniotomy flap, the sphenoid ridge was drilled flush with the orbital roof to facilitate exposure of the basilar tip aneurysm. After duratomy, gentle frontal lobe retraction allowed CSF drainage from the optic and carotid cisterns. Right optic nerve and right ICA were identified and the Sylvian fissure was opened from medial to lateral, following the bifurcation of right ICA to MCA trifurcation. A saccular aneurysm was found in the MCA trifurcation projecting inferolaterally. After dissection of the neck it was clipped. Next, opening the membrane of Liliequist, let to the distal basilar aneurysm from the corridor between the right optic nerve and right ICA. The aneurysm was located between the right PCA and right SCA with a wide neck, and its dome projected laterally to right. Successful clipping was achieved. The left ICA bifurcation aneurysm was identified after following the right A1, anterior communicating and left A1 arteries with minimal brain retraction, and gaining benefit from favorable neuroanesthesia. The aneurysm projected superiorly and was also clipped (figure ).\nThe patient experienced an uneventful post-operative period and was discharge within 5 days of surgery.

Appendectomy and short resection of the ileum with diverticulum, and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The immediate post operative period went well. After his discharge, his second hospital admission was two weeks after operation with abdominal pain and constipation problems which released spontaneously after two days.\nAt his third admission as acute abdomen, urgent laparotomy was performed in general endo tracheal anesthesia on the day after admission. Intra operative findings revealed small bowel dilatation, with intussusceptions of the terminal ileum, 2 cm from ileocecac valve. There were multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes at the meso of the terminal ileum, ascending and the transverse colon, without palpable liver metastases.\nWe have done des intussusceptions caused by tumor from the wall of the ileum. (Fig. , , )\nAdhesions at the anastomosis, and 60 cm above that, were released. The right extended haemicolectomy with end to end ileum-transverse anastomosis was performed. Post operative period went well; blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, pulse rate beats: 65/min; temp.: 36.7\u00b0C. The wound healed per primam. He was treated with frozen fresh plasma (several doses-seven), red blood cells (one dose); antibiotic, analgesics, H2 blockers, vitamins, amino acids, human albumins.

    "question": "A 40-year-old woman, 169 cm, 57 kg, underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy due to an adrenal pheochromocytoma. Preoperative evaluation of the patient was unremarkable. General anesthesia was induced using thiopental sodium, fentanyl, vecuronium and sevoflurane. A 7.5 Fr 3-lumen catheter was inserted under ultrasonographic guidance (linear probe: UST-5546, 5-10 MHz, machine: Prosound SSD-4400\u00ae, Aloka Medical, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) into the right internal jugular vein, and lung sliding was confirmed in both thoraces. Next, the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position. Before incision, ETCO2, Pmax, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were determined to be 33 mmHg, 17 cmH2O, and 100%, respectively. Pneumoperitoneum was established using CO2, intraabdominal pressure was maintained < 15 mmHg, and Pmax was 23 cmH2O at the time. Thirty minutes after inducing pneumoperitoneum, the ETCO2 and Pmax levels gradually increased to 43 mmHg and 30 cmH2O, respectively. Thereafter, SpO2 decreased acutely to 92%. On auscultation, the breath sounds from the left lung field were normal. However, the right side of the chest demonstrated no sounds. Immediately, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) increased from 0.5 to 0.8, and the endotracheal tube was withdrawn back to 2 cm in order to rule out endobronchial intubation. Because the depth of the endotracheal tube was 18 cm at the incisor teeth and confirmed the depth of endotracheal tube by cuff palpation at the sternal notch, we supposed that it was enough to rule out one-lung intubation without using bronchoscope. SpO2 was maintained at between 98-100%, though the right thorax was still silent. Pneumothorax was strongly suspected, and the chest was examined using ultrasonography. Lung sliding and seashore sign were demonstrated in the left lung (), however there was no sliding with barcode sign in the right lung (). Although the surgeon simultaneously inspected the diaphragm in detail, no apparent injuries or defects were found. Because the vital signs were stable and SpO2 and ETCO2 were normal, as indicated by an increased FiO2 and respiratory rate, the operation was laparoscopically completed.\nWhen the operation was concluded, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O was applied to inflate the collapsed lung. The patient was examined using ultrasonography whilst in the supine position, and at the same time, portable chest radiography was called to assess a pneumothroax. The ultrasonographic probe was placed on the right lower lateral chest wall between anterior and mid axillary line (), and we identified the \"lung point\" sign, which can be used to diagnose pneumothorax []. Also, chest radiography indicated a < 30% collapse of the right lung (). As the right hemithorax was continuously examined using ultrasonography, auscultation of the right lung improved, as well as the appearance of lung sliding sign and the disappearance of the lung point sign in whole right hemithorax within about 30 minutes after the end of the operation. No hemodynamic instability was noted, and SpO2 was maintained at 100% using only medical air. Hence, pneumthorax was considered to be capnothorax, and the patient was extubated without the insertion of a chest tube. The patient was transferred to the postanesthetic care unit (PACU) and did not complain about any respiratory disturbance. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

    "question": "A 77-year-old, Asian male patient (weight: 60 kg, height: 165 cm) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing periodic hemodialysis, was hospitalized due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He had no known history of psychosis prior to admission to the hospital. His social history was positive for alcohol consumption (25 mL a day for 10 years) and smoking (40 cigarettes a day for 30 years).\nOn admission, the patient was conscious and oriented to person, time, and place. Complete neurological examination including mental state was normal. The patient was in shortness of breath with the following vital signs: temperature 36.2 \u00b0C, blood pressure 156/91 mmHg, pulse 98 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20 per minute. He reported progressively worsening cough productive of yellow purulent sputum. Bilateral moist crackles were heard in both lungs on auscultation but with no wheezing. Markers of systemic inflammation were elevated (white blood cell count [WBC] 10.25 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein [CRP] 57.50 mg/L, procalcitonin [PCT] 0.49 ng/mL). Laboratory analysis revealed increased baseline serum creatinine (10.63 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 4.94 mL/min). His liver function was moderately impaired and classified into Child-Pugh class B. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse inflammation and interstitial change and a small amount of pleural effusion in bilateral lungs.\nIntravenous moxifloxacin was initiated 400 mg daily as empiric treatment for pulmonary infection on hospital day 1. A sputum sample was collected for microbiological culture before initiation of antibiotics and the result came back negative. On day 12, the patient was feeling tired and weak with hyperthemia (38.1 \u00b0C), hypertension (184/91 mm Hg), and worsened shortness of breath (26 beats/min). Plasma indicators for infection were elevated (WBC 11.50 \u00d7 109/L, neutrophils 97.1%, PCT 22.10 ng/mL). On the 13th day, moxifloxacin was switched to meropenem 500 mg intravenous every 8 hours. On 16th day, sputum culture revealed multidrug-resistant (MDR) A baumannii (resistant to carbapenem but sensitive to tetracycline). Then intraveous tigecycline was added to the regimen at a loading dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours.\nFourteen hours after tigecycline initiation, the patient became confused, disoriented to location, and the time. He had difficulty understanding instructions and was clearly disturbed in attention during the conversation. He was agitated, fearing that people around him were trying to harm him. Then he became verbally aggressive toward his family members and medical staff. His mental disorder worsened in the next 2 to 3 hours then he began having hallucinations, seeing a huge ball in the ceiling and asking the nurse to take it down so he could eat it. He asked other people to gather together and said he had important things to announce. His Confusion Assessment Method, which is a valid tool for the detection of delirium, was negative prior to the initiation of tigecycline, but became positive after it was started. His clinical manifestations also met the key features listed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-V) criteria from the American Psychiatric Association that characterizes delirium.[\nNo focal neurological disease was noted after neurological examination. A computerized tomographic scan of the head was then performed, and no abnormalities were identified. Oxygen supplementation (4 L/min via nasal cannulae) was initiated after the arterial blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia (pH 7.41; PaCO2 25 mmHg; PaO2 68 mmHg; Na+ 132 mEq/L; K+ 5.5 mEq/L). The patient did not have any prior history of mental illness. Drug-induced delirium was suspected and tigecycline was speculated to be the most likely offending agent after medication review (Table ). Since his delirium was treated with little success with olanzapine, tigecycline therapy was discontinued the next morning after the patient stayed awake the whole night. During the following day after discontinuation of tigecyline, the patient's mental state improved and delirium cleared slowly. He restored the ability of focus and orientation. Perceptual disturbances disappeared, and no visual illusions or vague delusions of harm were noted again.\nMeanwhile, markers of systemic inflammation were elevated (WBC 43.91 \u00d7 109/L, neutrophils 98.2%, PCT 34.04 ng/mL, CRP 89.09 mg/L). On Day 19, antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem (i.v., 500 mg q8 h) combined with minocycline (p.o., 400 mg q12 h), and amikacin (i.v., 200 mg qd). The regimen continued for 5 days but the patient did not respond well, showing even higher systemic inflammation markers and exacerbated dyspnea. Antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem 500 mg every 8 hours, and he started again on tigecycline 50 mg every 12 hours on 24th day with no loading dose.\nIn the morning of Day 25, the patient showed reduced psychomotor activity, decreased speech, but no obvious hallucinations. He had no idea of the time of day, nor where he was, although the day before he was fully orientated. The patient experienced a hypoactive state of delirium. CT examination of the chest showed increased inflammatory pulmonary lesions in bilateral lungs. Blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia without carbon dioxide retention, and the electrolytes were found to be within range. Also, no significant changes in blood profile like levels of liver enzymes or serum creatinine was observed compared with the last test taken before the delirium appeared again. Tigecycline was discontinued and delirium resolved in the afternoon. Antibiotic treatment was then switched to levofloxacin (i.v., 600 mg qd) and minocycline (p.o., 100 mg q12 h). But the patient did not respond well to the present antibiotic therapy and his dyspnea exacerbated. He was transferred to the intensive care unit 6 days later as mechanical ventilation was required. Unfortunately, the patient died of recurrent attacks of left heart failure probably caused by uncontrolled serious infections on 33th day. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

    "question": "A 57-year-old male with a 7-day history of fever and dyspnea was admitted to a local hospital and intubated for respiratory failure. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab. Thus, he was transferred as a severe COVID-19 pneumonia case in need of intensive care. He had a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and asthma. His height was 173 cm and his weight was 71.6 kg.\nOn arrival, the physical examination revealed body temperature of 38\u00b0C, blood pressure of 112/47 mmHg, pulse of 106 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min. He was deeply sedated (Glasgow Coma Scale score: E1VtM4) and suffered severe respiratory failure; arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.283, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 64 mmHg with invasive mechanical ventilation [pressure control ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O, the fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) of 0.75, inspiratory time of 1.6 s, frequency of 14/min, and the delivered tidal volume was about 470 mL]. The computed tomography scan revealed a bilateral consolidation with lower lung predominance; bulla or emphysema was not observed (Fig. ). Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, and tocilizumab were administered for the COVID-19 treatment. As mechanical ventilation, in accordance with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) strategy, did not show sufficient improvement, prone position ventilation was also initiated. His oxygenation improved slightly but not enough; PaO2 was 78.4 mmHg with FiO2 of 0.6.\nOn the 15th day after admission, the chest X-ray suggested a giant bulla in the right lung (Fig. ). One day later, his respiratory condition deteriorated and the chest X-ray revealed the presence of severe right-sided pneumothorax (Fig. ). A 24-Fr chest drain was immediately inserted, covering the patient\u2019s right chest with a plastic sheet and attaching an in-line filter to the suction tubing to minimize aerosolization. However, a significant air leak continued, and severe ventilator settings were still required (pressure control ventilation with PEEP of 12 cmH2O, PIP of 28 cmH2O, FiO2 of 0.6, inspiratory time of 0.9 s, frequency of 20/min, and the delivered tidal volume was about 320 mL) to compensate for the respiratory acidosis (pH 7.266, PaCO2 62.2 mmHg, PaO2 73.3 mmHg). The Murray score was 3. In addition, the pneumothorax was considered to be intractable and the continuous air leak increased the risk of medical staffs\u2019 exposure. Thus, VV-ECMO treatment (MERA centrifugal blood pump system HCS-CFP; Senko Medical Instrument, Tokyo, Japan) was promptly initiated for lung protection at 5 h after performing the tube thoracotomy. The right internal jugular vein was cannulated with a 19-Fr heparin-coated cannula for blood return, and the right femoral vein was cannulated with a 24-Fr heparin-coated cannula for blood access. The blood flow was 4.5 L/min and sweep gas was 5.0 L/min. Heparin was given to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time of about 50 s.\nThe PEEP was initially set to 0 cmH2O and the PIP was set to 5 cmH2O. After the air leak diminished, we gradually increased the pressure. On the 3rd day after starting ECMO, the PEEP was set to 5 cmH2O and the PIP was set to 10 cmH2O. On the 7th day, the PEEP was set to 8 cmH2O and the PIP was set to 12 cmH2O. On the 10th day, during the sweep gas off test, the arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.383, PaCO2 49.4 mmHg, PaO2 81.7 mmHg with PEEP of 10 cmH2O, PIP of 22 cmH2O, FiO2 of 0.4, inspiratory time of 1.1 s, frequency of 18/min, and the delivered tidal volume was about 480 mL. Thus, the patient was weaned from the ECMO and the chest drain was removed on the following day with no major comorbidities.\nWe performed the PCR test every other week. The PCR test result was negative on the 31st day after admission. The patient underwent tracheostomy on the 34th day. The ventilator management was completed on the 52nd day and he was transferred for rehabilitation on the 61st day. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

He had a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He had a dilated left atrium, minimal tricuspid regurgitation, and normal left ventricular systolic function. He had no history of dysphagia or esophageal regurgitation. Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography revealed that his right internal carotid artery was severely occluded. The neurologist recommended a right carotid endarterectomy before CABG. The right carotid endarterectomy was performed uneventfully 2 days before CABG, and the total anesthesia time was 3 h 30 minutes.\nA peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted into the left forearm, and an arterial catheter was inserted at the right radial artery. Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil 32 \u03bcg, propofol 120 mg, and rocuronium 70 mg.

For patient safety, the comprehensive intraoperative TEE guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography Council for Intraoperative Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists Task Force were followed.\nThe CABG was successful. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 105 minutes. During cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient\u2019s temperature was lowered to 33.0 \u00b0C at the rectum (33.0 \u00b0C at the nasal membrane). The TEE probe was in a neutral position in the upper esophagus and frozen to prevent injury. The average pump flow rate was 2.4 L/minute/m2. At the end of the procedure, the patient was rewarmed to 36.3 \u00b0C at the rectum (36.8 \u00b0C at the nasal membrane) for 60 minutes. During rewarming, TEE examination was performed, and the temperature of the TEE probe was increased to 39 \u00b0C. The TEE examination was discontinued intermittently and automatically to reduce the probe temperature. During the TEE examination, any movement or manipulation was gentle. Dopamine and nitroglycerin were given during weaning from bypass. The TEE probe was removed at the end of anesthesia. It was clean with no signs of blood. Extubation was done 11 h postoperatively.\nThe patient developed intermittent fever on the first postoperative day. Leukocytosis (19,440 white blood cells/\u03bcl) and a high level of C-reactive protein (30.0 mg/dl) were detected in the postoperative laboratory examination. The patient\u2019s fever ranged from 37.0 \u00b0C to 38.3 \u00b0C and did not subside until postoperative day 3, despite empirical treatment with tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. Computed tomography done to evaluate the coronary arteries incidentally found signs of abscess formation or air-containing tissue in the retrosternal, pericardial, and paraesophageal areas (Fig. ). Esophagography revealed contrast leakage in the right wall of the middle esophagus (Fig. ). The patient\u2019s hemodynamic variables, including blood pressure and heart rate, remained stable and were monitored closely. The patient was managed conservatively with fasting, parenteral nutrition, and intravenous antibiotics. We were prepared for surgical intervention, such as open esophageal repair or endoscopic primary repair, if there was any indication of unstable vital signs. The patient\u2019s postoperative fever abated on postoperative day 4. Follow-up esophagography disclosed no change in the esophageal lesion. The patient was allowed to drink sips of water 35 days postoperatively. On postoperative day 39, he began a normal diet. He was discharged without complications on postoperative day 42. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m\u00b2.",

    "question": "A 53-year-old white man, suffered from type 2 diabetes diagnosed 20 years ago, was referred to our department for evaluation of recent discovery of incipient nephropathy and retinopathy. He was previously visiting another endocrinologist in the town but because of a change of job, he moved into the city. He brought a letter specifying that his glucose control had been acceptable since the diagnosis of diabetes (HbA1c lower than 7%). Recently, he was diagnosed of incipient nephropathy (microalbuminuria 200 mg/24 hours), high systolic blood pressure (140 mmHg), high LDL cholesterol (134 mg/dL), and retinal hard exudates close to the macula treated with laser photocoagulation. His current medication included metformin (2.550 mg/day), Detemir insulin (50 U/day), premeals Aspart insulin, simvastatin (20 mg/day), Candesartan (16 mg/day), and AAS (100 mg/d). Physical examination revealed the following: weight of 120 Kg, height of 174 cm, body index mass of 30,27 Kg/m2, blood pressure of 150/75 mmHg, and normal auscultation. The skin of the upper back and posterior neck was erythematous, indurated, and painless () with moderate restriction of range of motion of the shoulders and neck.\nBlood analysis revealed the following: leukocytes of 7500 \u03bcL, haemoglobin of 16,3 g/dL, platelets of 281000 \u03bcL, sedimentation glomerular rate of 10 mm, glucose of 135 mg/dL, creatinine of 0,3 mg/dL, cholesterol of 157 mg/dL, HDL-c of 58 mg/dL, LDL-c of 81 mg/dL, triglycerydes of 90 mg/dL, C peptide of 3,8 ng/mL, TSH of 1,78 \u03bcUI/mL, negative antithyroid antibodies, microalbuminuria of 240 mg/24 h, and HbA1c of 6,7%. The serum protein electrophoresis was normal, excluding monoclonal gammopathy.\nWhen we noticed the lesion on the skin and asked about it, the patient explained that for the last 10 years he had noticed a progressive hardening of the skin of this area, that became less sensitive, and he also noticed a decrease in motility of his neck and shoulders. He did not remember if he was febrile 10 years ago when the lesion appeared on his back. He had never been studied for the skin disorder that he related with his obesity. The patient was sent to the dermatologist who suspected the diagnosis of scleredema and performed a skin biopsy. Histopathologic study demonstrated thick collagen bundles separated by spaces filled with mucin in the deep reticular dermis, consistent with scleredema adultorum of Buschke (). He recommended physiotherapy and UV-A1 therapy. The latter treatment was not made because of a lack of this modality of phototherapy in his town, then he started PUVA therapy.\nAfter two months of PUVA therapy (total cumulative UVA dose 120 J/cm2) and physical exercises, the patient has noticed amelioration of the mobility of the back and shoulders, and on exploration, the redness of the upper back has disappeared, and the skin was softer. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m\u00b2.",

    "question": "A 65-year-old male, 155 cm tall and weighing 53 kg, was scheduled to undergo mesh cage insertion and posterior spinal fusion from T6 to L5 for severe kyphosis due to spinal tuberculosis. Preoperative chest radiography revealed severe kyphosis of the thoracolumbar spine; however, there was no active lesion in the lungs. Thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography revealed spinal fusion at the level of T9\u2013L3, with volume decrease and deformity associated with severe kyphosis. The kyphotic angle was approximately 115 degrees (Fig. ). Preoperative pulmonary function tests revealed a mild restrictive pattern with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.81 L (63% of normal), a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 1.53 L (73% of normal), and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 85%. Preoperative electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm. In the preoperative visit, the patient exhibited limited neck motion because of severe kyphosis; he was Mallampati class III.\nIn the operating room, the patient was monitored using three-lead electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, and bispectral index. Due to inability to lie on his back without any supportive devices, the head of the operating bed was raised approximately 30\u201340 degrees, and anesthesia was induced in the semi-recumbent position. Anesthesia was induced using a target-controlled infusion of propofol (Schnider model) and remifentanil (Minto model); rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. Before tracheal intubation, preoxygenation was performed for 5 to 10 min with 100% oxygen in a face-to-face approach, with bimanual mask holding and mechanical ventilation. Although the awake intubation technique may be considered in cases of anticipated difficult intubation, the cause of difficult intubation in the present case was attributed to a kyphotic change, and not the airway itself, such as an anteriorly deviated glottis or soft tissue swelling; therefore, the authors believed that the patient\u2019s airway could be adequately maintained using bimanual mask-holding in a face-to-face position. Initially, direct laryngoscopy and video laryngoscopy were attempted; however, it was exceedingly difficult to visualize the vocal cords because of the patient\u2019s semi-recumbent position, his short stature, and the relatively large bed size. Moreover, a conventional lightwand technique from the head end of the patient was also difficult to perform. Although fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be considered as a first choice, it was temporarily unavailable because of an insufficient number of devices and well-trained staff. As the conventional overhead approach using laryngoscopy or lightwand was difficult, an alternative face-to-face approach using a lightwand was attempted. After all lights in the operating room were turned off, the anesthetist opened the patient\u2019s mouth while facing him, and slowly inserted the tracheal tube-launched lightwand, of which the tip was bent at an angle of 90 degrees along the base of the tongue in the midline. The bright red light at the tip of the stylet was transilluminated and positioned at the center of the neck; subsequently, the tracheal tube was gently inserted at the location of light on the neck. (Fig. ). Face-to-face lightwand intubation was successful on the first attempt, and no specific complications, such as hemodynamic instabilities, intraoral traumas, or others, were encountered. After tracheal intubation, invasive arterial blood pressure was monitored through a cannula placed in the left radial artery using a hemodynamic monitoring device (EV1000 clinical platform, Edward Lifesciences Corp., Irwin, CA, USA). The surgery lasted approximately 7 h, during which vital signs were adequately maintained. After completion of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed using sugammadex 200 mg followed by extubation in the operation room. Adequacy of respiration was confirmed, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with continued monitoring. Although there was no postoperative sore throat or hoarseness of voice, there was suspicion of pulmonary congestion on chest radiography. On arterial blood gas analysis, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) while breathing room air was 64 mmHg. However, the patient was not dyspneic, and pulmonary congestion and PaO2 improved over time. On postoperative day 2, the patient was transferred to the general ward without any significant problems.

    "question": "A 58-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our department of neurology with weakness of both arms and legs. Two months prior to admission, she had developed weakness in her bilateral limbs as well as pain in both shoulders. So, she went to a local hospital and reported that she felt the pain ease after receiving traditional Chinese medicine therapy. However, the weakness of her limbs gradually increased. So, she came to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Her past medical history included well-controlled hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, she had experienced pyrexia at times in recent years but without the detection of a raised temperature, and she did not seek diagnosis and treatment. She had no history of smoking, alcohol consumption, or recreational drug use. Her family history was unremarkable.\nOn admission, her height was 158 cm, body weight was 42 kg, body temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, pulse was regular at 122 beats/min, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min, and blood pressure was 170/98 mm Hg. The physical examination revealed that multiple lymphadenopathies were present in the bilateral axillary and the right side of the middle neck triangle, hyperpigmentation in the abdomen, and bilateral pitting pedal edema. The neurological examination showed bilateral upper and lower limb muscle weakness. The upper and lower extremity strength scores, as determined by manual muscle testing, were 3/5 and 4/5, respectively. Tendon reflexes were absent in all extremities, and pathological reflexes were negative. The patient was lucid, and the neurological examination revealed no cranial nerve abnormalities.\nLaboratory data on admission (Table ) revealed an elevated platelet count, but the coagulation profile was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 mm/h (normal range 0 to 20 mm/h). The concentration of C-reactive protein was increased. The testing showed strongly raised creatine kinase (CK) activity (7845 U/L, normal range 40\u2013200 U/L) and elevated liver enzymes in the serum. Blood tests showed a glucose level of 5.88 mmol/L and a glycosylated hemoglobin level of 7.1%. The renal function testing revealed that her creatinine level was normal, but Cystatin C was elevated, and her glomerular filtration rate was decreased. Meanwhile, her urine protein content was 133.35 mg/L (normal range 0 to 10 mg/L). Furthermore, her creatine kinase-MB, MB, and hs-TnT concentrations were significantly increased. Thyroid function tests revealed hypothyroidism. The thyroxin stimulating hormone level was 12.069 uIU/mL (normal range 0.35\u20134.94 uIU/mL), but the free-T3 and T4 concentrations were normal. The adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration was 3.24 pg/mL (normal range 4.7 to 48.8 pg/mL). The cortisol concentration was 1.1 ug/dL in 4pm (normal range 2.9 to 17.3 ug/dL). Human immunodeficiency virus, serology for hepatitis B and C, and tumor markers (cancer antigen 125, alphafetoprotein, careinoembryonic, carbohydrate antigen 199, cancer antigen 153, cancer antigen 242, prostate specific antigen and neuron specific enolase) were negative. Electrodiagnostic study showed that the motor conduction velocities, sensory nerve action potential, compound muscle action potential, and F wave latency were in the normal range in the bilateral median, ulnar, sural, and tibial nerves. Electromyography analysis showed there were mass abnormal spontaneous activities (fibrillation and positive sharp wave) in the left first dorsal interossei, biceps brachii, tibialis anterior, and the medial head of quadriceps femoris muscle, and myotonic potential in the left iliopsoas and tibialis anterior muscles. The neck triangle lymph node biopsy showed lymphadenosis, but the patient refused an immunohistochemical examination. On the thorax computed tomography (CT) scan, multiple enlarged axillary lymph nodes were observed (Fig. A). The flexor carpi radialis muscle biopsy showed many infiltrated lymphocytes, and the congo red staining test was negative. Combined with the symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory tests, we made a diagnosis of myositis. Hence, we treated the patient with methylprednisolone. However, she did not show a significant improvement, despite receiving standard therapy. Thus, immunoelectrophoresis was performed. Immunoelectrophoresis showed monoclonal IgA lambda serum. A bone marrow biopsy examination revealed that the plasma cell content was slightly elevated (0.84%). Furthermore, the concentrations of serum IgA and lambda free light chains were elevated. Serum IgG, IgM, and IgE levels and complements of C3, C4, and kappa free light chains were within the normal range. Furthermore, the VEGF concentration was slightly elevated. In addition, a X-ray of the skull revealed a small bone defect in the frontal lobe (Fig. B). Ultrasonography showed no cardiomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, or pleuroperitoneal fluids. Based on the observed skin manifestations, lymphadenopathies, pedal edema, IgA-\u03bb restricted paraproteinemia, plasma cell dyscrasia in bone marrow, elevation of VEGF, and other features, we made a diagnosis of atypical POEMS syndrome without polyneuropathy.

    "question": "A 33-year-old Japanese woman visited our hospital due to 1 week of continuous low-grade fever, low back pain, and numbness of the entire left lower limb. These symptoms occurred when she lifted a heavy suitcase. She had visited an orthopedic doctor and received a caudal block 4 days prior, followed by a high-grade fever and deteriorating low back pain starting 1 day prior. Her medical history included surgery to enlarge both breasts when she was 14 years old. She was not taking any medicines on a regular basis. She had a smoking history of five cigarettes a day starting at the age of 20, and no history of drinking alcohol. She underwent periodic medical exams, and the latest one, which had been 2 months before, appeared normal. The patient was employed at a film factory, as a product inspector, and had no food or drug allergies. She had no history of casual sex, intramuscular injections, or IV drug use.\nShe was 153 cm tall, and weighed 42 kg. Her vital signs were abnormal, with blood pressure of 104/85 mm Hg, a heart rate of 123 regular beats/min, a body temperature of 38.1 \u00b0C, oxygen saturation of 98% in ambient air, and a respiratory rate of 16/min; her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (E4V5M6) points. She complained of percussion tenderness to the lower thoracic vertebra and the upper sacral bone. Her manual muscle testing score for the left lower limb was 4; on the other hand, nothing else abnormal, including skin or neurologic findings, was detected upon physical examination.\nA routine laboratory examination of the patient revealed increased values of white blood cells, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and decreased values of blood urea nitrogen and creatine kinase. On the other hand, other values were normal, including complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry, urine tests, and cerebrospinal fluid examination (). She also tested negative for rheumatoid factor, autoantibodies such as anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, serologic test for hepatitis B and C, syphilis, HIV, thyroid hormone, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, flu test, and 2/2 sets of blood culture. Head and chest-abdomen computed tomography (CT) scans and transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal results. On the other hand, a complete spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a 0.5- mm-thick layer of spinal epidural fluid in the posterior epidural space in the whole thoracic and anterior epidural space from the L5 to S2 vertebral body level region, which compressed the epidural space (, and , respectively). These findings were revealed as low intensity in a T1-weighted image, and high intensity in a T2-weighted image. Other findings, such as discitis, were not confirmed.\nAt this point, we suspected a diagnosis of disseminated SEA, but the origin was still unknown. However, an orthopedic surgeon recommended against performing CT-guided percutaneous needle aspiration of the abscess, based on the locations of the lesions. The patient was hospitalized, and we started 13.5 mg/day of piperacillin-tazobactam, following which she gradually became symptom-free. However, on the 14th hospital day, she strongly requested that she be discharged from the hospital, so we changed her antibiotics to 500 mg/day of levofloxacin tablets, and continued treatment. During her return visit, 16 days after her discharge, she was well. We confirmed normal values of inflammation biomarkers, including WBC, CRP, and ESR, and in addition we also confirmed abscess improvements in both the thoracic and sacral regions through an MRI scan (, and , respectively). Based on these findings, we ended her treatment that day without treatment complications. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m\u00b2.",

    "question": "A 53-year-old man (height, 170 cm; weight, 89 kg) was admitted to the hospital because of a 1-year history of shortness of breath after exercise. The patient was a smoker, had a history of hypertension, and was taking captopril and nimodipine. Breathing was reduced in the left lung. However, neither rhonchus nor moist rales were heard during auscultation. Chest computed tomography revealed a GEB, and the left lung was compressed by about 95% with a right mediastinal shift (). An electrocardiogram showed normal findings, and echocardiography revealed that the heart was located in the right thoracic cavity. The left ventricular diastolic function was decreased, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 64%. Laboratory tests showed no obvious abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis showed the following: pH: 7.43, PaCO2: 41 mmHg, PaO2: 94 mmHg, lactate: 1.4 mmol/L, potassium: 3.6 mmol/L, sodium: 138 mmol/L, calcium: 1.10 mmol/L, FiO2: 21%, and SpO2: 98%.\nOn the day of surgery, the patient\u2019s electrocardiogram, blood pressure, SpO2, and bispectral index were monitored upon entry into the operating room. A radial artery catheter and right internal jugular venous catheter were placed. The patient\u2019s arterial blood pressure was 175/109 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats/minute, and SpO2 was 94%. Before anesthesia, 40 \u00b5g of dexmedetomidine was infused within 10 minutes. The thoracic surgeon then created a small incision at the intersection of the sixth intercostal space and the left mid-axillary line to puncture the lung bulla and insert an indwelling catheter (14 Ga, 16 cm in length; Arrow International/Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) into the GEB to drain it for 15 minutes. The patient was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen at 6 L/minute for 5 minutes. Anesthesia was administered using 100 mg of propofol, 30 \u00b5g of sufentanil, and 50 mg of rocuronium. A 37-Fr right double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted with the help of a visual laryngoscope, and single-lung ventilation was performed after proper alignment had been confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The tidal volume was set at 5 to 6 mL/kg, the respiratory rate was 15 to 17 breaths/minute, the positive end-expiratory pressure was set at 5 cmH2O, and the inhalation:expiration ratio was 1:2. Propofol, remifentanil, and sevoflurane were used to maintain anesthesia. The intraoperative bispectral index was maintained at 40 to 50. After resecting the GEB (), one-lung ventilation was switched to two-lung ventilation and the lungs slowly expanded with a low tidal volume until complete lung re-expansion was observed. During the 3-hour surgery, the patient experienced 50 mL of blood loss, was administered 1300 mL of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, and excreted 500 mL of urine. After the operation, the double-lumen endotracheal tube was replaced with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and the patient was sent to the intensive care unit for monitoring and further treatment. Two hours after entering the intensive care unit, the patient was fully awake and the tracheal tube was smoothly removed. The following day, the patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery ward, where he recovered; he was discharged 12 days later.

    "question": "A 41-year-old Chinese woman was referred to the Department of Neurology, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China, with the chief complaint of high spiking fever for approximately a month with bilateral lower limb fatigue and difficulty in defecation for more than five months. She had been residing in Yingde City of Guangdong Province for 10 years with no known prior exposure to any infectious or occupational diseases. In July 2010, she was diagnosed with 'whole body multiple metastases of lymphoma'. Due to economic reasons, the patient was transferred at the end of July 2010 to Donghua Hospital of Yingde City for treatment of her symptoms of infection, constipation, low potassium and leukopenia. By August 2010, the patient was unable to walk with bilateral lower limb fatigue and was subsequently admitted to the Department of Radiation Oncology at Nanfang Hospital.\nOn admission, the patient was 152 cm tall and weighed 52 kg. Her blood pressure was 112/82 mm Hg, temperature 38.5\u00b0C with a respiratory rate of 16 times per minute. No superficial enlarged lymph nodes were palpable. Inspiratory and expiratory sounds were normal to auscultation. There was no percussion tenderness over the liver or kidney. Muscle strength of upper limbs was normal and that of lower limbs was 3/5. Bilateral Babinski sign was positive. Sensation of pain and touch below the knees were slightly reduced. Physiological reflexes were slightly active. There was no pedal edema. All other physical tests were normal.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: total urinary protein, 5.61 g/dL (56.1 g/L); serum albumin, 2.89 g/dL (28.9 g/L); blood urea nitrogen, 2.24 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L); and creatinine, 0.54 mg/dL (48 \u03bcmol/L). The urine protein and occult blood values were negative. Urinary leukocyte count was 48/\u03bcL (4.8 \u00d7 107/L); erythrocyte count, 3.78 \u00d7 106/\u03bcL (3.78T/L); hemoglobin, 9.9 g/dL (99 g/L); lymphocyte count, 1.12 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL (1.12 g/l) and platelet count, 1.73 \u00d7 105/\u03bcL (173 g/l).\nBone marrow aspiration was performed and the slide smear revealed 41.5% immature cells of unknown origin. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) showed the following changes (Figure ). The bilateral renal parenchyma was markedly swollen with obvious diffuse increase in signal intensity. Increased signal intensity was observed in multiple thoracic vertebral bodies, multiple lumbar vertebral bodies, bilateral sacrum, ilium, proximal humerus and femur medullary cavities. Mildly increased signal intensity was observed in both lungs. The possibility of interstitial pneumonia was not excluded. Multiple bilateral neck and mediastinum lymph nodes were mildly enlarged with inflammatory proliferation. The spleen was markedly enlarged with mild diffuse increase in signal intensity. A large volume of pelvic effusion was detected.\nThe day after admission, a percutaneous renal biopsy was performed. Eleven glomeruli were present with no evidence of mesangial cell proliferation or capillary wall thickening. Island-like accumulations of medium to large lymphoid cells were observed in many areas of the interstitium, with round vesicular nuclei containing distinct basophilic nucleoli (Figure ). Immunohistochemical analysis showed the atypical lymphoid cells to be positive for B-cell markers CD20 (Figure ) and negative for CK, CD3, CD45RO and CD10. They were positive for large B-cell lymphoma marker mum-1 (Figure ). Immunohistochemical staining using anti-CD34 confirmed the accumulation of lymphoid cells to be localized within the peritubular capillary lumina (Figure ). Immunofluorescence revealed negative staining of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C1q with no glomerular immune deposits. Electron microscopy did not detect any electron dense deposits, but did show a cluster of atypical lymphocytes encircled by a peritubular capillary wall.\nPathologic examinations of percutaneous renal biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma of Stage IVE. The patient returned to the local hospital for symptomatic treatment after diagnosis. Ten days later she was readmitted into Nanfang hospital due to sudden bilateral lower limb fatigue and inability to walk. She was treated with chemotherapy consisting of CHOP (cyclophosphamide 1.0 g D1+Doxorubicin 60 mg D1+leurocristime 2 mg D1+Prednisone 100 mg D1-5) for a week.

    "question": "A 6-year-old male from the West Region of Cameroon diagnosed with HIV 3 years back and on pediatric first line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen\u2014Abacavir, Lamivudine and Efavirenz (ABC/3TC/EFZ),\u2014was referred from a health center to our institution for suspicion of pulmonary TB based on a 10 days history of productive cough, intermittent nocturnal fever and generalized abdominal pain, which persisted despite administration of undocumented broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics for 8 days. His mother was on the first month of hospitalization at our institution for management of MDR-TB, a referral hospital for MDR-TB.\nOn examination, the child had respiratory distress with a pulse rate of 137 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 cycles/min and temperature of 40.1 \u00b0C. His weight and height were 20 kg and 80 cm, respectively. There was pallor of the conjunctivae, palms and soles. The BCG scar was present on the left forearm. The heart was tachycardic with audible functional systolic murmurs. A bilateral consolidation syndrome was also noted on examination of the lungs. An initial diagnosis of pediatric pulmonary TB/HIV coinfection, associated with a clinical anaemia was made. MDR-TB was the principal differential diagnosis.\nA sputum analysis done was positive for acid-fast bacilli. Since he was a household contact of the mother and given that he became very ill, and unable to produce one more sputum, we chose to collect the gastric aspirate and sent for gene Xpert MTB/RIF and culture/DST in other to make a good diagnosis early enough. The gastric aspirate was positive for a Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rifampicin resistant strain using Xpert MTB/RIF assay. After performing the proportional method -drug susceptibility testing (PM-DST) on Lowenstein Jensen slopes, the child was found to have the same resistance pattern like the mother (Isoniazid-susceptible, Rifampicin-resistant, Ethambutol-susceptible, Kanamycine-susceptible, Ofloxacine-susceptible and streptomycine-not done). Due to the severe anaemia at 6.1 g/dl, he received 20 ml/kg (400 ml) of whole blood in emergency. The results of his pre-therapeutic work-up for MDR-TB regimen were as follows: slightly raised Aspartate Aminotransferase but normal Alanine Aminotransferase at 68 and 28.5 U/l, respectively; Serum Creatinine was normal at 0.45 mg/dl. An antero-posterior view chest X-ray revealed a bilateral micro-nodular interstitial opacity associated with bilateral hilar adenopathy (Fig. ). Also an audiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG) done were not contributive.\nAfter discussing the case with the MDR-TB consultant of the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP), with regards to the results of his pre-therapeutic work-up, the short 9 month\u2014regimen was initiated according to his weight: 4 months of Amikacin/Moxifloxacin/Prothionamide/Isoniazid/Clofazimin/Ethambutol/Pyrazinamid for the initiation phase, followed with 5 months of Moxifloxacin/Clofazimin/Ethambutol/Pyrazinamid for the continuation phase [4(AmMfxPtoHCfzEZ)/5(MfxCfzEZ)]. His viral load was 23,144 copies/\u00b5l and the CD4 cell count 149cells/mm.\nDay 36 of hospitalization was marked by another episode of decompensated severe anaemia at 3.9 g/dl and non-infectious enteritis (with abdominal pains and watery stool). This prompted another transfusion of whole blood cells at 20 ml/kg (400 ml), and iron and folic acid syrup at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day (120 mg) were continued twice daily for a month. In addition, the patient presented with mild bilateral knee pain which was immediately controlled with 2 mg/kg (40 mg) dose of diclofenac divided twice a day. He also presented with a progressive brownish discoloration of the eyes with no visual impairment for which he is been followed-up. During the course of the treatment, the child was doing well and was able to produce a good sputum sample; he was discharged 4 months after the initiation phase with consecutively negative monthly sputum controls (Table ). The child is presently on the ninth month of treatment with no further complaints. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m\u00b2.",

    "question": "A 38-month-old boy was brought to the Seoul National University Children's Hospital due to a sudden onset of respiratory difficulty. The patient had no perinatal problems but began to develop intermittent alcoholic stool at 1 year of age. Beginning at 2 years of age, the patient suffered from frequent abdominal cramps. The patient presented with dyspnea and tachypnea but did not show signs of fever, cough, cyanosis, chest pain, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\nThe patient's height and weight were 95.6 cm (25\u201350th percentile) and 13.3 kg (10\u201325th percentile), respectively. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 123/72 mmHg; pulse rate, 152 beats/min; respiratory rate, 36 breaths/min; and body temperature, 36.9\u00b0C. The chest wall expanded symmetrically with chest retraction. Decreased breathing sound was heard in the left lung field.\nChest radiography and computed tomography (CT) showed massive left pleural effusion (). Percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) was conducted and pleural effusion was drained. Pleural fluid revealed elevated amylase levels of 25,460 U/L and lipase levels of >6,000 U/L. Serum results also revealed elevated amylase levels of 888 U/L and lipase levels of 1,067 U/L, which was suggestive of acute pancreatitis.\nAbdomen CT showed retroperitoneal fluid collection, diffuse pancreatic ductal dilatation, and atrophy in the pancreatic body and tail parenchyma, which was suggestive of CP. Although the abdomen CT did not reveal a definite PPF tract, the elevated amylase and lipase levels from the pleural fluid were suggestive of a fistula tract between the pancreas and pleura. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed suspicious luminal narrowing of the pancreatic duct, with probable pancreatic duct stone and sludge. A tract near the left diaphragm is thought to be the fistula that connects to the pleural cavity ().\nThe patient was kept under fasting conditions with massive intravenous hydration, and octreotide continuous infusion and total parenteral nutrition were initiated. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed to further clarify the possible duct anomaly and subsequent treatment. The pancreatic duct was tortuous and dilated, and there was a filling defect due to the pancreaticolith (). A single pigtail plastic stent was inserted at the pancreatic duct and some white stones and protein plugs were removed. After symptoms improved, the PCD was removed and octreotide was tapered.\nThe pancreatic stent was removed spontaneously via defecation 8 days after stent insertion. After 3 days, a fever of up to 39.4\u00b0C developed and left pleural effusion increased. Serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated to 285 U/L and 527 U/L, respectively. Medical treatment, including fasting and octreotide continuous infusion, was restarted, and PCD insertion was conducted again. A second ERCP was done, and the stent was placed at the minor papilla through the major papilla. The pleural drain was removed after a week of post-stent insertion with no recurrence or effusion. The patient was discharged at hospital day 32. The stent was removed after 3 months. The patient is being followed-up regularly for exocrine dysfunction and recurrence of pancreatitis by monitoring fecal elastase, and serum amylase and lipase levels, respectively.\nThis patient had a family history of pancreatic diseases (). The patient's uncle underwent 80% distal pancreatectomy due to CP with multiple stones, and the grandfather had pancreatic cancer. The great-aunt and first cousin also had pancreatic diseases. The patient and his family underwent genetic tests, which revealed that the patient, mother, uncle, and grandfather were R122H heterozygotes for PRSS1 gene which encodes cationic trypsinogen. His father and brother had negative results. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m\u00b2.",

    "question": "Our patient is a 4-year-old African-American boy born full-term via vaginal delivery, following an uneventful pregnancy, with a birth weight of 2722 grams (9th percentile). He required two weeks in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for neonatal abstinence syndrome and poor feeding. He was only breastfed a handful of times, and various formulas were tried without success. His difficulties with feeding persisted following discharge, and soon after birth, he developed chronic diarrhea. Throughout his first year of life, he also suffered from multiple respiratory tract infections. His motor development was appropriate while both social and language development were advanced; he was very talkative and interactive. He first presented at two years of age with rectal prolapse. Given his history and presentation, cystic fibrosis was considered (frequency of 1:15,000 in the African American population) [], but sweat chloride testing was negative. He went on to develop recurrent rectal prolapse, requiring a surgical reduction at three years old. The cause of the rectal prolapse was likely diarrhea and malnutrition, secondary to his underlying diagnosis [].\nAt three years of age, he was again admitted for emesis and weight loss in the setting of chronic diarrhea and worsening abdominal distention. It was reported that despite his persistent weight loss, he typically had a good appetite. His family denied both generalized protein aversion and episodes of severe illness following protein-rich meals. At the time of presentation, he weighed 13.2 kg (3.2 percentile) and was 93 cm (1.6 percentile) tall. His hair had gradually become straighter and lighter than was typical for him over the preceding year. He had significant hepatomegaly, with a liver span of 18 cm on ultrasound. Laboratory examinations demonstrated mild anemia, hypokalemia and hypoalbuminemia in the setting of transaminitis with a normal ammonia. Radiographs of his femurs and hands bilaterally, in addition to lumbosacral spine and pelvis, all demonstrated osteopenia. An echocardiogram showed mild left atrial enlargement, a small pericardial effusion and respiratory mitral inflow variability, all consistent with constrictive pathophysiology, thought to be secondary to his systemic processes. Congenital disorders of glycosylation were considered, however carbohydrate deficient transferrin levels were only slightly elevated, inconsistent with congenital disorders of glycosylation, though possible in cases of hereditary fructose intolerance. Urine amino acids were significant for elevated lysine and ornithine, though not to the extent expected in lysinuric protein intolerance. He was discharged with a working diagnosis of hereditary fructose intolerance, instructed to follow a fructose-free diet.\nThough he had initially improved on the fructose-free diet, after three days, his condition worsened. He developed food aversion and began spiking intermittent fevers. He was readmitted two weeks later with fever, decreased oral intake, weight loss, worsening abdominal distension and pain following an additional episode of rectal prolapse. The 60 most common CFTR mutations were tested at this time and were all negative. Plasma and urine amino acids were collected and the patient was started on empiric citrulline while awaiting results (, ).\nTargeted DNA Sequencing looking for SLC7A7 gene variants was ordered, and was negative for any pathogenic mutations. However, deletions, duplications and intronic variants will not be detected by this testing. LPI can be caused by deletion or duplication of SLC7A7 in approximately 15\u201320% of patients; however, a deletion/duplication assay could not be obtained []. Biopsies of the middle and distal esophagus, stomach, duodenum, terminal ileum and ascending and transverse colon were significant only for a focal increase in lamina propria eosinophils in the duodenum. Liver biopsy was significant for moderate to severe steatosis of the parenchyma, focal mild cholestasis, mild inflammatory infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and fibrosis. Both an upper GI series and contrast enema were completed but unrevealing.\nFollowing protein restriction and initiation of citrulline to correct for the intracellular defects of arginine and ornithine, carnitine was also started as levels were found to be low. On this regimen, our patient\u2019s condition improved. His family reports he has had significantly more energy and his hair has begun to darken. Follow-up after 5 months showed a significant improvement regarding his nutritional status. His weight is 17.1 (45th percentile) but his height is still at 1st percentile.

She had no symptoms of fever, gross hematuria, foamy urine, photosensitivity, alopecia, oral ulcers, skin rash, joint pain, or urgency or pain in urination.\nHer physical examination on admission showed no remarkable findings other than the mild edema of the lower extremities. Her body weight was 50 kg, height was 159 cm, and blood pressure was 114/82 mm Hg. There were no palpable lymph nodes, and the chest and abdominal exams were normal.\nLaboratory tests showed hemoglobin, 129 g/L; white blood cells, 8.17 \u00d7 109/L; and platelets, 151 \u00d7 109/L. Urinalysis was positive for 4+ protein; RBC, 3/HP protein/creatinine ratio, 4.88 g/g Cr; and urine protein, 4.74 g/24 hour. Blood biochemistry analysis revealed albumin, 23.8 g/L; blood nitrogen urea, 5.60 mmol/L; serum creatinine, 50.0 \u03bcmol/L; uric acid, 208.0 \u03bcmol/L; and cholesterol, 6.24 mmol/L.\nANA was positive (1:1000); anti-dsDNA antibody was positive; anti-Sm antibody was negative; serum C3 was 0.6720 g/L (normal range 0.785\u20131.520 g/L); and C4 was 0.0806 g/L (normal range 0.145\u20130.360 g/L). There were negative findings for C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, anti-streptolysin O, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-glomerular antibodies. Immunofixation electrophoresis did not reveal monoclonal immunoglobulin. Renal ultrasonography showed that the size of the right kidney was 10.5 \u00d7 4.5 \u00d7 4.2 cm3, while the left measured 11.5 \u00d7 5.0 \u00d7 4.9 cm3.\nA renal biopsy was performed, and light microscopy revealed that 35 glomeruli had thickening of the GBM (Fig. A) and subepithelial fuchsinophilic protein deposition (Fig. B). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed granular deposition of IgG and C3 along the glomerular capillary wall. The glomerular capillary was negative for PLA2R and THSD7A staining. An electron micrograph revealed subepithelial electron-dense deposits, thickening of the GBM, and foot process fusion (Fig. D).\nWe diagnosed the patient with membranous lupus nephritis (LN) (pure class V LN). We stained EXT1 by immunohistochemistry after the association of exostosin 1/exostosin 2 (EXT1/EXT2) and secondary MN was reported.[ The results showed positive staining for EXT1 along the glomerular capillary wall (Fig. C).\nThe patient was given prednisone at a dose of 40 mg per day, which was tapered down after 1 month, hydroxychloroquine, and aspirin. Four 200 mg doses of RTX were given with the frequency of doses dependent on CD19+ B-cells counts; the average interval between doses was 2 months (Fig. ).\nThe patient achieved complete remission 8 months after her hospital admittance. The serum albumin increased from 23.8 g/L to 38.7 g/L. The urinary protein creatinine ratio level dropped from 4.88 g/g Cr to 0.27 g/g Cr. The ANA and anti-dsDNA antibody were negative.

    "question": "A 53-year old man (height, 175 cm; weight, 87 kg) was scheduled to undergo subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein reconstruction for pancreatic cancer after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Laparoscopic left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma was performed 1 year prior; therefore, harvesting the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction was planned because the left renal vein was too short. Preoperative serum creatinine level and potassium level were 1.39 mg/dL and 4.1 mEq/L, respectively.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced rapidly with propofol, rocuronium, fentanyl, and remifentanil and maintained with desflurane. The patient\u2019s vital signs remained stable while resection of the distal stomach, gallbladder, distal common bile duct, and pancreatic head was performed. Bleeding from the first jejunal vein (J1V) occurred during adhesion detachment around the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and clamping of the J1V was required to control the bleeding. Immediately after J1V clamping, bowel congestion progressed because the patient\u2019s intestinal blood flow had been bypassed from the SMV to the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein through J1V due to complete obstruction of the portal vein by the tumor. Therefore, a heparin-coated bypass tube (ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube, TORAY MEDICAL Co., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted from the SMV to the right great saphenous vein to relieve the bowel congestion. Several minutes after insertion of the ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube, blood potassium level rose from 4.7 mEq/L to 6.0 mEq/L, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia occurred. Chest compression was promptly performed by surgeons, and anesthesiologists attempted direct current defibrillation several times; epinephrine, magnesium sulphate, bicarbonate, lidocaine, and amiodarone were also administered. In addition to resuscitation, anesthesiologists inserted a blood-access catheter to the right internal jugular vein and started continuous renal replacement therapy to prevent elevation of blood potassium level. Spontaneous circulation was recovered after 30 min. The surgical team decided to discontinue the surgery, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after packing gauze into the abdomen and with the ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube left inserted. Total blood loss was 5620 mL, and total fluid balance was + 6115 mL. The operation time was 10 h 30 min.\nTwo days after the first operation, the patient was scheduled to undergo tumor resection and portal vein reconstruction with REIV. The surgical team abandoned using the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction because of concerns that brain congestion after harvesting the jugular vein could affect brain function recovery. Anesthesia was maintained with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, rocuronium, and remifentanil. Continuous hemodiafiltration had been performed in the ICU due to persistent anuria and continued during the operation to prevent hyperkalemia. Both legs were compressed with a pneumatic compression device throughout the operation to prevent deep venous thrombosis formation. A section of the REIV 5 cm in length was harvested intraperitoneally with a surgical stapler, and the REIV distal end was closed with a 4-0 polypropylene running suture. The inferior epigastric vein, pubic branch of the obturator vein, and the deep circumflex iliac vein were preserved. A surgical nurse noticed swelling of the patient\u2019s right leg 2 h after harvesting; the surgical team ensured careful observation throughout the surgery because a transient change by congestion of the right leg was suspected. Blood potassium level was slightly elevated after REIV resection, but ventricular arrhythmia was absent. Surgery was completed as scheduled (operation time, 7 h 3 min), and the patient was transferred to the ICU again. Total blood loss and total fluid balance were 2485 mL and + 2587 mL, respectively.\nOn ICU admission, distention and fullness of the right leg worsened. An orthopedist diagnosed the patient with acute compartment syndrome, and right leg elevation to lower the intracompartmental pressure was initiated. Blood potassium level was rapidly elevated immediately after leg elevation (Fig. ), which caused sustained ventricular tachycardia despite efforts to lower blood potassium level such as the administration of bicarbonate, glucose-insulin, and continuous hemodialysis with potassium-free dialysate. Chest compressions were initiated immediately. Ventricular tachycardia was prolonged; therefore, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) was induced, and spontaneous circulation was recovered after resolution of hyperkalemia (Fig. , Table ). Emergent fasciotomy was performed by orthopedists 1 h after induction of V-A ECMO because the intracompartmental tissue pressure of the anterior compartment was 70 mmHg.\nV-A ECMO was withdrawn 2 days later, and the patient was extubated 10 days after portal vein reconstruction. He had no apparent neural deficits; however, paralysis and paresthesia of the right leg persisted after discharge from the ICU 17 days post-operatively.

    "question": "We described a male patient, born to a 38 years old mother at 30 weeks\u2019 gestation by emergency Cesarean section, performed because of pre-eclampsia and IUGR associated with poly-hydramnios, detected by 26 weeks. The pregnancy was complicated by maternal type 2 DM, requiring subcutaneous insulin, Antenatal serologies (TORCH, HIV, Treponema and Hepatitis) were protective. Cytogenetic investigation of the fetus by villocentesis confirmed a normal 46,XY karyotype. Paternal medical history was unremarkable. Parents were non-consanguineous Caucasians.\nApgar scores were 6 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes of life. Physical parameters were as follows: weight 1190 g (<10\u00b0 centile), length 36 cm (<3\u00b0 centile) and head circumference 26 cm (<10\u00b0 centile). Physical examination was normal except for a moderate respiratory distress, During the first hours of life, the respiratory status worsened, evolving towards a third-degree hyaline-membrane disease that required surfactant administration, mechanical ventilation for a 24 hour period and non-invasive ventilation for 10 days.\nThroughout the first 3 days of life, the patient experienced a significant weight loss (as high as 19% of the birth weight), associated with polyuria (4.7-5.5 ml/kg/h) and hypernatremia (serum sodium 152\u2013159 mEq/l), despite adequate fluid intake. At first, hypernatremia was interpreted as a consequence of the excessive weight loss and treated with large amounts of daily intravenous fluids (180\u2013200 ml/kg/d). The clinical course was complicated by one episode of Serratia Marcescens septic shock during the second week of life and disseminated intravascular coagulation requiring plasma administration, platelet transfusion and aggressive antibiotic therapy.\nCDI was subsequently suspected as a result of persistent hypernatremia (serum sodium 150 mEq/L), high plasma osmolarity (322 mOsm/L) and low urine osmolarity (190 mOsm/l) with a Uosm/Posm ratio < 1 associated with failure to thrive during the first four weeks of life. The diagnosis of CDI was confirmed by the desmopressin test, showing a normal urine concentrating capability after nasal desmopressin (DDAVP) administration with rapid raise in urine osmolarity and reduced plasma osmolarity and the brain MRI at 34 weeks postmestrual age demonstrating the lack of posterior pituitary hyperintense signal. Bilateral asymmetrical optic nerve hypoplasia associated with right orbital bone hypoplasia was also observed, suggesting the diagnosis of WF []. No other abnormalities of the CNS were found.\nOphthalmologic examination revealed eyeball and right optic disc hypoplasia, associated with exotropia. Visual evoked potential confirmed the pathological findings of the right optic pathway, while the electroretinogram resulted normal. Audiological examinations were normal. Borderline TSH values with normal thyroid function were recorded during hospitalization, but no treatment was required until the end of the first year of life, when levo-thyroxine substitutive therapy was started because of primary non-autoimmune central hypothyroidism with a small thyroid gland. During the five years follow-up mild psychomotor and mental retardation were diagnosed. No glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus have been detected so far.\nAfter the catch-up growth, length and head circumference has stabilized around the 50\u00b0 centile and, after the first year of life, body weight was above the 97\u00b0 centile.\nWater and electrolyte balance is maintained with standard doses of nasal desmopressin.\nNo progression of the bilateral asymmetrical OA was noted at the 1-year follow-up MRI. However, new pathological signs (reduced corpus callosus, moderate ventricular dilatation, asymmetric hippocampus and altered occipital peri-ventricular white matter signal intensity) [] were noticed.\nGenetic investigation of the patient and his relatives revealed a segmental paternal heterodisomy of the chromosome 4 (segmental pat-hUPD4), involving at least part of the promoter and the first exon of WFS1 that we hypothesized could remove splicing regulatory motifs located in intron 1. Direct sequencing analysis of WFS1 cDNA showed a mixed sequencing pattern including the wild-type transcript sequence and two splice variants. The first splice variant was a previously described 4-bp deletion in exon 2, while the second one exhibited the complete skipping of exon 2 and, probably, the loss of the transcription start site. RT-PCR confirmed a normal mRNA expression compared to young controls, while Western blot analysis showed a significantly decreased Wolframin expression []. Informed consent for genetic studies was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m\u00b2.",

    "question": "A 32-year-old male presented with acute abdominal pain, reduced urine output and red urine since three days. No fever, vomiting or bowel or bladder symptoms were observed. The pain in the abdomen was diffuse and more as discomfort, which started following a jerk while the patient was traveling in a bus. No prior history of diabetes, hypertension or renal disease was reported.\nInvestigations conducted in a local hospital had revealed numerous red blood corpuscles (RBCs) and white blood corpuscles (WBCs) in urine sediment and 4 + proteinuria. Ultrasound showed moderate ascites. Plain computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed hepatomegaly with ascites. Serum creatinine measured the following day was high (4.0 mg/dl); hence, an opinion from a nephrologist was sought.\nUpon examination, he was anxious and hemodynamically stable. The lungs were clear and abdominal distension and ascites was present. Pedal edema was absent. Following are the reports of the investigation carried out: hemoglobin, 17.6 g/dl; total leucocyte count, 20100 cells/m3; differential count polymorphs, 79%; lymphocytes, 17%; eosinophils and monocytes, 2% each; urine showed 3 + protein; 6-8 WBCs and numerous RBCs; arterial blood gas analysis pH, 7.31; bicarbonate, 10.8 meq/l; pCo2, 22.2 mmHg; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 60 mg/dl; creatinine, 5.9 mg/dl; sodium, 131 meq/l; potassium, 5.1 meq/l; calcium, 8.6 mg/dl; phosphorus, 6.7 mg/dl; uric acid, 10.2 mg/dl; total bilirubin, 0.3 mg/dl; protein, 8.0 g/dl; albumin, 4.2 g/dl; serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), 38 u/l; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), 25 u/l; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 96 u/l.\nWe suspected intraperitoneal rupture of the urinary bladder because of the abrupt onset of symptoms. We performed catheterization of the urinary bladder, draining 3.5 l of hemorrhagic fluid. Abdominal distension began to regress and the patient started feeling relieved after this drainage. Cystogram showed leakage of the contrast into the peritoneal cavity []. Ascitic fluid creatinine and urea nitrogen approximated the values that are usually observed in urine samples rather than in blood (86 mg/dl and 425 mg/dl, respectively).\nFollowing this confirmation, the patient underwent emergency laparotomy. A 5-mm tear was found in the dome of bladder, which was repaired in two layers. He was maintained on indwelling urethral and suprapubic Foley catheters. Within 24 h, the biochemical abnormalities in the patient improved to normal. Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

    "question": "A 74-year-old, avid female gardener and active smoker with a past medical history notable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension presented to the hospital with one week of progressively worsening New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III dyspnea and fatigue. She endorsed associated cough productive of yellowish mucoid sputum. She denied chest pain/discomfort, palpitations, pre-syncope, syncope, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). There was no history of fever, arthralgia, myalgia, or rashes.\nIn the emergency department, the patient was afebrile, blood pressure was 85/49 mm Hg, heart rate was 150 per minute, and respiratory rate was 22 per minute, with oxygen saturation of 94% on six liters of oxygen via a nasal cannula. The patient appeared lethargic and was using accessory muscles for respiration. General examination showed pallor. The oral mucosa was dry, with a thickly coated tongue. The neck veins were flat. Heart examination revealed a fast, irregular heart rate, variable first heart sound, and normal second heart sound without any murmurs or gallops. Lung examination revealed bilateral mid to late inspiratory crackles. The abdomen was soft, distended, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. Extremities were noted to be cold, with 1+ pitting edema and normal capillary refill time.\nRoutine laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.5 (4.0-10.5 k/uL), hemoglobin of 9.9 (12.5-16 g/dL), and hematocrit of 32.3 (37-47%). Her baseline hemoglobin concentration was around 15 g/dL. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 101.9 (78-100 fL) with elevated mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) of 34 (25-33 pg) and normal mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) of 33.4 (32-36 g/dL). Platelet count was 34 (150-450 K/uL), with elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) of 12.4 (7.4-11.4 fL). Peripheral blood smear showed intracytoplasmic parasites suspicious for Babesia along with reduced platelets (Figure ). The parasitic level was found to be at 9.04%. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 1544 U/L (125-220 U/L), haptoglobin was <6 mg/dL (27-139 mg/dL), total bilirubin was 5.4 mg/dL (0.3-1.0 mg/dL), with a direct fraction of 3.5 mg/dL (0.0-0.2 mg/dL). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 202 U/L (5-40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 90 U/L (7-52 U/L), with albumin of 2.3 g/dL (3.5-5.0 g/dL). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 51 mg/dL (7-17 mg/dL) with a normal creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, sodium 129 (135-145 mmol/L), potassium 4 (3.5-5.1 mmol/L), chloride 103 (98-107 mmol/L), serum bicarbonate 19 (24-32 mmol/L), and calcium 7 (8.4-102 mg/dL).\nThe chest X-ray was remarkable for cardiomegaly with a small right pleural effusion and small airspace opacity within the right lower lobe concerning for consolidation or segmental atelectasis. Given her presentation, she was started on intravenous fluids along with empiric antibiotic coverage for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. As the peripheral smear was remarkable for Babesia, she was started on atovaquone and doxycycline for a possible co-infection with Lyme. Blood titers for Anaplasma and Lyme were sent. Positive pressure ventilation was started to help with respiratory distress. She received intravenous fluids; however, she continued to remain hypotensive and required norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. Given the severity of her disease and parasitic load, a decision was made to do erythrocytapheresis.\nFollowing erythrocytapheresis, the parasitic load decreased to 5.54%. The patient remained in shock and clindamycin was added to the regimen. Her renal function worsened, which was believed to be secondary to pigment-induced nephropathy from hemolysis. Due to the inadequate response and development of acute kidney injury, repeat erythrocytapheresis was performed, resulting in a reduction in parasite load to 1.75%. At this point, Lyme immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunoblot was found to be positive, with negative immunoglobulin G (IgG). Anaplasma titers also showed recent/current infection, with IgG >1:1024 (reference <1:64) and IgM 1:80 (reference <1:20). Atovaquone and azithromycin were discontinued and quinine was added. Her hemodynamic status improved and she was titrated off of vasopressor support along with an improvement in respiratory status. Her complete blood count and renal and hepatic function normalized after 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

    "question": "A 58-year-old Asian female with a five-year history of depression presented to the emergency room with progressive generalized weakness, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss over the past three months. She stated her symptoms recently started worsening over the past two weeks. She complained of increased thirst, generalized bone pain, and weight loss of greater than 20 pounds in the past one month. Despite being on antidepressants, the patient presented with symptoms of depression. She denied any history of hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, or cancer. She denied any history of smoking, alcohol, or use of illicit drugs. Family history was unremarkable.\nOn physical examination, she was afebrile, blood pressure 110/73, and pulse 82 beats per minute. Tongue was dry on examination. Neck revealed a 4 \u00d7 4 cm fluctuant smooth contour nodule that was nontender on palpation and moved with deglutition. The patient was subsequently worked up and found to have hypercalcemia, (serum calcium level, 23.3 mg/dL) (normal range 8.6\u201310.6 mg/dL), (phosphorous, 3.1 mg/dL) (normal range 2.4\u20134.4 mg/dL), albumin 2.8 g/dL (normal range 3.5\u20135.0 g/dL), BUN 52 mg/dL (normal range 7\u201321 mg/dL), creatinine 3.8 mg/dL (normal range 0.7\u20131.5), blood glucose 91 mg/dL (normal range 65\u2013105 mg/dL) Blood work for ANA, Rheumatoid factor, ACTH, cortisol, liver functions were unremarkable.\nIntravenous hydration and loop diuretics were administered to promote kalciuresis. After the patient was resuscitated, further evaluation revealed plasma level of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) to be 1364 pg/mL (normal 10\u201365 pg/mL). Thyroid ultrasonography showed 3.5 \u00d7 4.5 \u00d7 3.2 cm complex cystic and solid lesion in the right thyroid gland. A parathyroid scan with Technitium-99-sestamibi scintigraphy revealed an \u201cavid lesion with retained activity in the periphery\u201d (). Fine needle aspiration of the cold mass revealed hemorrhagic fluid without evidence of malignant cells in the tissue. The tissue stained for PTH was negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1). A CT scan of head and abdomen was unremarkable. Preoperatively, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry bone mineral density study (DEXA) showed osteopenia of the lumbar spine, left hip, and left femoral neck.\nThe patient underwent surgical exploration for the cyst twice by two different surgeons on two separate occasions. The first surgery was stopped half way with the postoperative diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma that was not operable due to 2-3 cm mass underneath the strap muscles that was adherent to the right side of the trachea and dense fibrotic tissue (initially suspected to be a tumor) along the right side of the neck. The patient's condition was further complicated by paralysis of the right vocal cord from the first surgical exploration.\nIn the second surgical exploration, the following steps were taken.\nThe previous incision was reopened and the flap was raised in the superior direction with use of cautery. Sternohyoid muscles were ligated. There was dense inflammatory tissue involving the sternothyroid muscle, carotid, and jugular veins. The sternothyroid muscle was firmly adherent to the thyroid. Dissection began with incision of the median raphe and the isthmus muscle and proceeded in the medial to lateral direction. The thyroid was then elevated at the level of trachea medially and the right recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified inferiorly.\nThe patient was preoperatively documented to have paralysis of the right vocal cord. However, the right recurrent laryngeal nerve was later found to be intact after stimulation with a threshold of 1.7 mA. Following stimulation, the intact recurrent laryngeal nerve was dissected into the superior mediastinum and superiorly in its entry at the cricothyroid membrane. There was dense inflammatory tissue adhering to both the strap muscles and the right lobe of thyroid. Suspecting a tumor, an incision was made along the borders of the mass. In the attempt to resect the tumorlike mass, the right lobe of thyroid adhering to the dense mass was resected as well. The frozen section of the dense mass revealed only collagen and fibrous tissue. The sternothyroid muscle, the carotid artery, and the jugular vein were then freed from the dense inflammatory tissue in an en bloc dissection. Further into the dissection, a cystic mass with a glistening capsule was then found in the superior mediastinum near adjacent parathyroid tissue. The cyst was removed from the superior mediastinum and the specimen was sent for frozen section. Microcopic analysis of the cystic mass confirmed the diagnosis of an enlarged hypercellular parathyroid (330 mg). In addition to the hypercellular parathyroid tissue, the specimen contained hyalinized fibrous connective tissue scar, right thyroid lobe, and the cystic wall. Within the fibrous tissue there was hemorrhage and residual hypercellular parathyroid tissue with osteoid focus ().\nAfter surgery, the patient had variable parathyroid hormone levels between 110 and 292 pg/mL (normal range 10\u201365 pg/mL) along with hypocalcaemia. The patient underwent MIB1 scintigraphy for detection of aberrant parathyroid tissue causing elevated parathyroid hormone levels. Postoperative MIBI scintigraphy study was negative for parathyroid tissue.\nThe patient was prescribed calcium 1 gram per day. Her symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and depression subsequently subsided after surgery. The patient restored her original voice with resolution of voice hoarseness. Renal functions improved (creatinine 1.1 mg/dL) (normal range 0.7\u20131.5 mg/dL). Repeat neck ultrasonography and 99 mTc methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) scintigraphy after six months did not reveal remaining active parathyroid tissue. However, she developed low T4 (0.5 ng/dL) and elevated TSH (14.2 uIU/mL) because of hemithyroidectomy. She was then maintained on Synthroid 50 mcg orally every day. After a 3-year follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic. Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

    "question": "A 79-year-old asymptomatic Caucasian male presented with progressive renal failure with abnormal serum creatinine (range of 1.82 to 2.18) in July 2012. Complete blood count (CBC) showed red blood cell count (RBC) of 3.36 x 108/uL, hemoglobin 10.9 g/dl, hematocrit 33.1%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 99 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 32.8 pg, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 33.0%, red cell distribution width (RDW) 15.8% and white blood cell count (WBC) 4,000/uL, with differentials: neutrophils 50%, lymphocytes 37%, monocytes 8%, eosinophils 4%, basophils 1% and platelet count of 178,000/uL. Comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP) revealed: glucose 96 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 23 mg/dL, creatinine 2.18 mg/dL, sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 4 mmol/L, chloride 107 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 25 mmol/L, albumin 4.4 g/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, bilirubin (total) 0.8 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.3 mg/dL and magnesium 2.7 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsy of the left kidney showed severe lymphocytic inflammation mainly in the areas of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (Figure ).\nImmunohistochemical staining showed atypical lymphocytes that were positive for CD20 and negative for CD5, CD10, CD19, CD22 and CD23. Molecular testing revealed an Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement; these findings were consistent with marginal zone B cell lymphoma. Furthermore, immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy demonstrated seven glomeruli with diffuse pseudo-linear staining of the glomerular capillary loops for albumin (1+). Glomerular staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q and kappa or lambda light chain was negative. Interstitium stained positive for fibrinogen, while protein casts were stained positive for IgA (3+), kappa light chain (3+) and lambda light chain (3+). By electron microscopy (EM), the glomerular basement membrane had a normal trilaminar structure, the mean thickness was within the normal range without electron-dense deposits or tubuloreticular inclusions and the majority of podocytes foot processes were intact (Figure ). No immune complexes were detected by IF or EM.\nOn serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation, we found IgM kappa monoclonal gammopathy and serum M-protein level of 0.3 g/dL. Quantitative immunoglobulin testing was performed for IgG (699 mg/dL), IgA (51 mg/dL) and IgM (470 mg/dL). Serum free light chain (SFLC) showed kappa (37.9 mg/L), lambda (1.58 mg/L) and kappa/lambda ratio of 23.99. Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) showed a protein level of 91 mg/dL and M-spike of 18.1%. Bone marrow (BM) biopsy showed 30% BM involvement by clonal B cells, morphologically consistent with marginal zone B cell lymphoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan was found normal in 2012 and 2013. The patient was treated with five doses of weekly rituximab and one dose of rituximab-bendamustine combination, but renal function worsened and treatment was stopped in 2013. The patient was monitored closely without further treatment until 2017. PET scan (2017) showed a mild enlargement of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes (aortocaval from 1 x 0.8 to 1.4 x 1.2 cm, left periaortic from 1.4 x 0.5 to 1.3 x 1.0 cm) and a partially calcified subcarinal node from 3.1 x 1.1 to 3.5 x 1.5 cm (non-avid), and the spleen size increased from 12.2 to 14.2 cm in cubic centimeter dimension (Figure ). One dose of vincristine and prednisone was given at that time, but renal function declined further. The patient was offered bortezomib/dexamethasone or ibrutinib for further treatment consideration, which he declined.

    "question": "A three-year-old Afghan boy was admitted to our hospital with a history of recurrent seizures since the age of two years. The first seizure was reported to be fever-induced at the age of four months. Cognitive and motor development was normal until the age of one, but thereafter neurodevelopmental decline was reported. He had been having generalized tonic-clonic seizures since the age of two years. The diagnosis of epilepsy was made in another center because of recurrent seizures and multiple antiepileptic drugs were started. He has been treated with levetiracetam, clonazepam, valproic acid, and pyridoxine treatments. The patient was admitted to our hospital from Afghanistan for further evaluation for recurrent seizures and hypocalcemia. He was born at full-term gestation after an uncomplicated pregnancy including an absence of polyhydramnios with a birth weight of 3500 gr from a consanguineous family (first degree cousins). His prenatal and natal history was uneventful. His family history was unremarkable. His family history was negative for epilepsy and neurological abnormalities, as well as any known renal, thyroid, or parathyroid disease. Physical examination revealed his growth parameters were within normal limits [height: 95 cm (25-50 p), weight: 15 kg (50-75 p)]. He did not show any dysmorphic or neurocutaneous features. He was conscious and had a speech delay. Bilateral horizontal nystagmus was prominent. He was hypotonic with normal reflexes. The rest of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory data included a serum Mg2+ level of 0.12 mmol/L (normal range: 0.7-0.86 mmol/L), calcium 4.7 mg/dL, phosphorus 6.2 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 222 U/L, parathyroid hormone 6 pg/mL (normal range: 11-67 pg/mL), 25-OH vitamin D3 60.1 ng/mL, sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 4.24 mEq/L, albumin 3.2 g/dL, and uric acid 5.3 mg/dL. The urine fractional excretion of Mg2+ was 12% (normal range: <4%) with normal urine calcium/creatinine ratio. Laboratory examinations including acute phase reactants, serum glucose, and albumin levels, and liver and renal function tests were normal. The renal ultrasound did not show any medullary nephrocalcinosis. Electroencephalogram showed slow background activity without any epileptiform discharges and magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed mild diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy ().\nLaboratory examination revealed the characteristic combination of severe hypomagnesemia, hypoparathyroidism, and profound hypocalcemia. Clinical and laboratory findings together suggested the diagnosis of HSH as responsible for disruption in Mg2+ homeostasis. The genetic analysis of the patient revealed a novel, homozygous variant in the TRPM6 gene (NM017662.4: c.5473_5474insGCTTC (p.H18225Rfs*18) (p.His1825Argfs*18). This is a frameshift variant and based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria this variant was classified as pathogenic. This is a null variant and is predicted to cause severe loss of gene function. TRPM6 gene sequence analysis was performed using MiSeq next generation sequencing platform, an Food and Drug Administration approved diagnostic system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Sequences were aligned to the hg 19 genome within MiSeq Reporter software (Illumina Inc.). Visualization of the data was performed with IGV 2.3 (Broad Institute-www.software.broadinstitute.org) software (). Informed consent was obtained from the parents for genetic analysis. The parents were heterozygotes for the same variant.\nIntravenous Mg2+ sulfate was administered at 50 mg/kg along with intravenous calcium for three days after which the serum Mg2+ increased and calcium levels normalized. The treatment was switched to oral Mg2+ sulfate 4x2000 mg (~533 mg/kg/d) but abdominal pain and diarrhea was significant. In addition, on this oral therapy, serum Mg2+ decreased to 0.2 mmol/L and convulsions re-occurred without hypocalcemia. The treatment was replaced with oral Mg2+ citrate and soon after switched again to Mg2+ carbonate because of persistent hypomagnesemia and gastrointestinal side-effects. Finally, Mg2+ oxide sachets were started and blood Mg2+ reached 0.78 mmol/L with high dose Mg2+ oxide (3x2 sachets ~ 150 mg/kg/d) (). Antiepileptic treatment was reduced. His muscle tone, cognitive development, and motor development improved. He has been stable on an oral maintenance dose of 2000 mg of Mg2+ oxide daily with borderline blood Mg2+ levels without hypocalcemia.

    "question": "A 65-year-old female patient presented to our emergency room with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and pain radiating towards the back. The patient history included nothing specific other than diabetes mellitus (DM) for 20 years and cholecystectomy a year ago. She did not have a history of alcohol consumption and she was on subcutaneous insulin treatment twice a day. During the physical examination, the patient was observed to be in a confused state and her general state was poor; her blood pressure was 90/55 mmHg, heart rate was 132/min, body temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, and the respiratory rate was 28/min. Her abdomen was slightly distended and epigastric tenderness was detected. No rebound or guarding was observed. The laboratory parameters were as follows: Hb: 17.1 g/dL, Hct: 45.7%, WBC: 8.9 K/uL, PLT: 505 K/uL, sedimentation: 37/hour, CRP: 24 mg/dL, glucose: 255 mg/dL, urea: 28 mg/dL, creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL, AST: 57 U/L, ALT: 34 U/L, LDH: 1995 U/L, amylase: 212 U/L, lipase: 349 U/L, triglycerides: 2148 mg/dL, albumin: 2.3 g/dL, calcium: 6.5 mg/dL, and HbA1c: 9.6%. The blood gas analyses gave the following results: pH: 7.32 mm/Hg, pCO2: 44 mm/Hg, PO2: 72 mm/Hg, HCO3: 19.6 mmol/L, and lactate: 0.9 mmol/L. The other laboratory parameters were normal. The abdominal ultrasonography was interpreted in favour of AP. In the abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), the gall bladder could not be observed (excised) and the pancreas was diffusely enlarged (), while widespread increases of density and fluid retention were observed in the peripancreatic bilateral anterior renal fascia, splenic hilum, mesenteric adipose tissue, and the pelvic region. There was 19 \u00d7 18 mm necrosis area in the head of pancreas. Filling defects (thromboses) were observed in the splenic vein at the level of the tail of the pancreas. The patient's CT image shows the AP and splenic vein thrombosis (). A central venous catheter was placed and the patient was prescribed blood glucose tests every six hours and insulin treatment for the regulation of her blood glucose levels. After the consultation with the infectious diseases department, the patient was started on 4 \u00d7 500 mg/day of imipenem. She was administered 4 \u00d7 5000 units of low molecular weight heparin through the subcutaneous route and infused intravenously 5 units of regular insulin along with each 1000 mL 5% dextrose fluid and lipid apheresis was performed once a day for three days. After the three times lipid apheresis, the triglyceride values declined to 829 mg/dL. In addition to the low molecular weight heparin, the patient was started on warfarin treatment and the dose was adjusted to keep the patient's INR value over 2. When the patient's general condition was observed to improve after the treatment, she was discharged with the recommendation of a low-fat diet and fenofibrate and warfarin treatment.

    "question": "An 82-year-old man was brought to our emergency department after he was found lying unresponsive on the floor of his house. At the hospital, the patient reported having decreased oral intake, nausea, malaise, abdominal discomfort and decreased urinary output. His medical history was significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, abdominal aortic aneurysm, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and chronic back pain. His medications included ibuprofen, oxycodone, gabapentin, atorvastatin, losartan, carvedilol, furosemide, ticagrelor, apixaban, pioglitazone, insulin glargine, sitagliptin, tamsulosin and escitalopram. He had no known allergies.\nOn examination, vitals revealed a temperature of 36.8oC, blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg, pulse of 65 beats/minute and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute. Physical examination was unremarkable except for bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Laboratory findings included a hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL (reference range [RR] 14 - 18 g/dL), serum creatinine of 11.6 mg/dL (RR; 0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 119 mg/dL (RR; 7 - 18 mg/dL), serum potassium of 6.0 mMol/L (RR; 3.5 - 5.1 mMol/L), estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) of 4 mL/min/1.73m2 (RR > OR = 60 mL/min/1.73m2), serum phosphorus of 3.9 mg/dL (RR; 2.5 \u2013 4.9 mg/dL), serum calcium at 9.2 mg/dL (RR; 8.6 - 10.3 mg/dL), albumin at 3.7 g/dL (RR; 3.4 \u2013 5 g/dL), serum uric acid at 10.5 mg/dL (RR; 2.6 \u2013 6 mg/dL) and a serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) at 327 U/L (RR; 26 \u2013 192 U/L). Two months earlier, his serum creatinine was at 1.06 mg/dL, BUN at 14 mg/dL and EGFR>60 ml/min/1.73m2. Spot urinalysis revealed clear light-yellow urine with a specific gravity of 1.010 without any protein. The urine did not show significant white blood cells, red blood cells and was also negative for nitrites and leukocyte esterase. No urine casts were identified, and no eosinophils were noted. A catheter was inserted and urine sample from the catheter showed a spot urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio at 287.6 mg/g. Serum complement C3 and C4 levels were normal. Renal ultrasound demonstrated increased echogenicity throughout the kidneys, likely related to intrinsic medical renal disease without any hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.\nOn the third day of the admission, a renal biopsy was performed which showed global sclerosis in 2/9 examined glomeruli without any significant changes in the mesangium. The glomerular basement membrane was unremarkable. The main findings were in the tubulointerstitial compartment which showed evidence of tubular damage and tubulitis (A-D). The tubules appeared simplified and lined by flattened cells. There were scattered inflammatory cells in the interstitium which were a combination of eosinophils and mononuclear cells and were associated with active tubulitis. Some of the tubules appeared to be dilated and contained hyaline casts but no myelomatous casts were seen. There was a moderate degree of thickening of the walls of the arterioles along with the small and medium sized arteries. Immunofluorescence demonstrated linear tubular basement membranes with positive staining for lambda light chain (3+). In contrast, kappa light chain stain was essentially negative (E and F). Electron microscopy (EM) revealed interstitial edema and inflammation without any immune complexes, fibrillary material, or light chain deposits in the tubulointerstitial compartment (). No proliferation of lysosomes or atypical lysosomes were identified in the damaged proximal tubules. Increased numbers of lysosomes, a few atypical, were seen in selected proximal tubules. These findings were found to be consistent with ATIN. This raised the suspicion for a monoclonal lambda light chain-related tubulointerstitial process.\nThe findings on the biopsy prompted us to pursue the workup for multiple myeloma. We obtained a plasma protein electrophoresis which showed a peak in the beta-1 globulin zone and a monoclonal lambda protein was identified by immunofixation. Serum free light chains showed an elevated lambda up to 9503 mg/L and an almost normal kappa of 24.53 mg/L. Bence Jones protein was present in the urine. Given the significant lambda light chain burden, a diagnosis of monoclonal lambda light chain-related ATIN was made. Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate showed a plasma cell neoplasm with lambda light chain restriction (A and B). Prussian blue stains of the biopsy revealed adequate iron storage (C). CD138 was positive in increased numbers of plasma cells representing approximately 50% of the marrow cellularity (D). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was also performed using a set of probes specific to multiple myeloma. Plasma cell enrichment was performed revealing various abnormalities including: 13q14 deletion (1R2G, 66.0%, normal < 11.9%), an atypical IgH gene rearrangement/partial gene deletion (1R, 64.8%, not seen in validation studies), and a gain in chromosome 1q (CKS1B) (3R2G 67.0%, normal < 8.6%). Counts for the remaining probes were within the normal reference range. No lytic lesions were seen on the bone survey. Laboratory tests were repeated showing a white blood cell count of 12.4 x 103 /\u03bcL (RR; 4.8 - 10.8 x 103/\u03bcL), red blood cell count of 2.7 x 106 /\u03bcL (RR; 4.63 - 6.08 x 103/\u03bcL), hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL (RR; 14 - 18 g/dL), hematocrit 25.6% (RR; 42 - 52%), MCV 91.8 fL (RR; 79.0 - 92.2 fL), RDW 13.7% (RR; 11.5 - 15.0%), and platelets 182 x 103 /\u03bcL (RR; 150 - 450 x 103/\u03bcL). The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was hence confirmed.\nDuring hospitalization, the patient received plasmapheresis and one cycle of CyBor-D (Cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone). At the time of discharge (day 20 of the admission) serum creatinine was at 6.2 mg/dL, BUN at 100 mg/dL and the EGFR at 9 ml/min/1.73m2. One week after discharge, lambda free light chain was noted to be 3107 mg/dL. The patient completed his second cycle of CyBorD as an outpatient but failed to return for scheduled follow-ups. He was readmitted to our hospital 2 months later for a community acquired pneumonia complicated with respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressor support. During this hospitalization, his mentation worsened; he had episodes of cardiac arrhythmias with worsening kidney function. The patient\u2019s family decided to transfer him to hospice.

Fecal occult blood test was positive.\nThe x-ray film of the upper GI tract, small intestine series and barium enema revealed variable sized, scattered, grouped, multiple polyps in the C loop of the duodenum, proximal jejunum, and from the rectum to the ascending colon (). Endoscopy of the upper GI tract and rectosigmoid showed red colored, variable sized, grouped, multiple polyps in the first portion of the duodenum to the distal (), and in the rectum at 12cm, 15cm, and 18cm from the anal verge.\nThe culture and semar of nail scrapings were negative for fungi.\nThe microscopic finding of specimens taken from rectal polyps showed hamartomatous polyps with cystic dilatation of glands and containing smooth muscle bundle supports, epithelial proliferation and infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils (). The microscopic finding of specimens taken from duodenal polyps also showed Peutz-Jehgers polyps with columnar and goblet cells in the superficial portion and some inflammatory cell infiltration.\nDuring admission, the patient was treated with blood transfusion, albumin infusion, and iron tablet medication, thereafter he was discharged with improvement. At present he is in good general condition with disappearance of the onychodystrophy, edema of face and lower extremities, and he showed improvement in laboratory tests during the OPD follow up check. His father and sister also revealed similiar findings of the upper GI tract, small intestine series, barium enema, and endoscopy without hypoproteinemia, hypokalemia, and onychodystrophy. The microscopic findings of rectal polyps showed hamartomatous polyps having smooth muscle fibers from muscularis mucosa and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration without cystic dilated glands (). The younger sister developed two segmental intestinal intussusceptions in the proximal and distal jejunum, one at a time, and underwent an operation recently.

He complained also of chronic generalized weakness and fatigue. He denied nausea or vomiting, but did have occasional loose stools. The hypokalemia persisted despite discontinuation of diuretic treatment for hypertension and fludrocortisone that had been prescribed briefly for orthostatic hypotension. There was no improvement with aggressive oral potassium supplementation in amounts up to 120 meq per day. The patient's serum potassium level normalized on three occasions when he was hospitalized and given supplemental potassium (COPD exacerbations in 7/06 and 1/07, pseudoseizures in 7/07), but the hypokalemia promptly recurred after discharge from the hospital (Figure ).

He presented to the hospital, and laboratory tests revealed magnesium 0.8 mg/dL, potassium 1.7 mmol/L, creatinine 1.52 mg/dL, creatine phosphokinase 15,913 IU/L, calcium 7.1 mg/dL, albumin 3.7 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 253 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 125 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase 734 IU/L. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood and 0\u20133 red blood cells. Laboratory values 2 months before were unremarkable, despite having chronic diarrhea for several months (Table ). He was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement were initiated. The patient felt that the onset of symptoms correlated with the initiation of budesonide, so the medication was held. Over the course of the week, his symptoms improved drastically and ultimately resolved, correlating with creatine phosphokinase and potassium improvement. He followed up 3 weeks later, asymptomatic and with normal laboratory values (Table ). Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

Trace elements panel was normal. UGI endoscopy showed gastric ulcer in the prepyloric area, verrucous gastritis in the body, and reflux esophagitis of grade A. Colonoscopy revealed no definite mucosal lesion, but a solitary polyp was noted in the rectum. Additionally, multiple cystic lesions were found on pelvic ultrasonography, but these were not considered the direct cause of her chronic abdominal pain. Medical treatment was administered for her UGI mucosal lesions. The rectal polyp was removed using cold snare. The size of polyp was 0.5\u00d70.3\u00d70.2 cm. Pathological examination of the excised polyp revealed that it was a tubular adenomatous type, which is known to be a precancerous lesion (). Her abdominal symptoms improved after polypectomy, although her chronic GI symptoms did not seem to be related to the polyp. Following the diagnosis, tumor marker tests (CA-125, \u03b1FP, \u03b2-HCG) were performed, and they were normal.

In the examination of a peripheral blood smear, pancytopenia with rouleaux formation was observed. Bone marrow aspirates showed hypocellular marrow without an increase in the number of myeloblasts but showed increased infiltration of plasma cells at a frequency of 14.9% (). In addition, megakaryocytic dysplasias such as separated nuclei () and hypolobulated nuclei () were found, accounting for 30% of the total number of megakaryocytes. Erythroid dysplasias such as binucleation and delayed mitosis were also found (), as well as mild granulocytic dysplasias such as hyposegmentation, accounting for 15% and 10% of the total numbers of erythroid and granulocytic lineage cells, respectively. Examination of a bone marrow biopsy specimen () revealed 35% cellular marrow with diffuse infiltration of plasma cells in the immunohistochemical stain for CD138 expression (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark; ).\nBoth serum and urine immunofixation analyses using Hydragel IF K20 kit (Sebia, Cedex, France) were performed, and the results showed the presence of monoclonal gammopathy of IgA and lambda type. The subsequently performed serum electrophoresis using Capillarys Protein(E) 6 kit (Sebia, France) showed the presence of monoclonal gammopathy accompanied by M-peaks of 1.27 g/dL. All radiological evaluation results did not show definite evidence of osteolytic lesion. The results of a subsequently performed karyotype analysis showed 46,XX, del(20)(q11.2)[15]/46,XX[5], indicating the presence of del(20)(q11.2) clone, at a frequency of 75%. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis results showed nuc ish(D20S108X1)[156/200], indicating the presence of heterozygous 20q12 deletion, at a frequency of 78%. As the patient showed pancytopenia accompanied with multilineage dysplasia, MDS-related chromosomal abnormality, and monoclonal gammopathy with an increase in serum creatinine level, she was finally diagnosed with the simultaneous presentation of symptomatic PCM and MDS and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) that were unrelated to prior chemotherapy.

    "question": "A 9-year-old male English Setter presented with a 6-month history of ulceration of the left upper eyelid as the only clinical finding (Fig. a). On examination, the lesion was round, elevated, and well circumscribed. A malignant eyelid tumour was suspected, and the lesion was excised for histopathological examination. A fine-needle aspirate was obtained from a popliteal lymph node from the left side. The popliteal lymph node was chosen, as the owner did not want any expensive diagnostic procedures and the popliteal lymph node was the easiest accessible. The dog was doing well and presented without fever, clinical signs of anaemia, or weight loss. A routine blood profile was unremarkable except for a haematocrit (packed cell volume, PCV) of 37%, which is borderline low. The blood test also showed a serum calcium: 2.43 mmol/L (ref 1.98\u20133.0 mmol/L), serum albumin: 31 g/L (ref 23\u201340 g/L), serum alkaline phosphatase: 53 U/L (ref 23\u2013213 U/L), and serum creatinine: 91 \u00b5mol/L (ref 44\u2013159 \u00b5mol/L). Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and glucose were also within normal limits. C-reactive protein (CRP) was < 10 mg/L, which is also normal. The owner did not want additional examinations or treatments other than excision of the tumour and for this reason, a thoracic radiograph, abdominal ultrasound, and a full haematological profile were not performed. No systemic treatment was initiated, and 2 months after surgery an unremarkable full haematological profile was obtained. 19 months after the diagnosis the dog was still alive and doing well with no signs of relapse.\nThe specimen was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin immediately after surgical excision, processed and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 \u00b5m) were prepared and stained with haematoxylin and eosin according to standard protocols. Furthermore, sections were routinely stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Gram stain, and Gomori\u2019s methenamine silver stain (GMS) to detect microorganisms. Giemsa staining was performed to visualize the blood derived cells in the specimen.\nImmunohistochemical stainings were performed on a Ventana Benchmark Ultra Platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The following antibodies were used: CD3 [clone 2GV6, code 790-4341, rabbit anti-human, ready-to-use (RTU), Roche (Hvidovre, Denmark)], PAX-5 [clone SP34, code 790-4420, rabbit anti-human, RTU, Roche (Hvidovre, Denmark)], vimentin [clone V9, code 790-2917, mouse anti-human, RTU, Roche (Hvidovre, Denmark)], and Ki-67 (clone MIB-1, code M724001, mouse anti-human, 1:100, Dako).

    "question": "A 13-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency department with bilateral leg pain after an unwitnessed fall onto the street from the sidewalk. There was no history of major trauma, syncope, or seizure. He had severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with poor verbal skills. On examination, he was crying and had tenderness over the bilateral knees and right ankle. The range of motion of the hip and knee was limited by pain. There were no bony deformities. Lower extremity X-rays revealed acute comminuted and impacted fractures of the bilateral distal femoral metaphyses with anterolateral apical angulation of the distal fracture fragments (Figures and ). Diffuse osteopenia was noted, but no other radiographic signs of rickets were seen, including metaphyseal widening, splaying, cupping, fraying, or prominence of the costochondral junctions on chest X-ray.\nOn physical examination, his height was at the 4th percentile (appropriate with his midparental target height at the 10th percentile). His weight was at the 52nd percentile and his body mass index (BMI) at the 87th percentile, meeting the criteria for overweight. His physical exam, apart from his limited lower extremity movement, was remarkable for a positive Chvostek sign, early Tanner stage 3 development with 8 cc testes descended bilaterally, and vertical fingernail ridges. Skin examination was negative for bruising, acanthosis, and striae. The differential diagnosis included vitamin D deficiency, malabsorptive disorder (i.e., celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease), osteogenesis imperfecta, prolonged steroid use, renal failure, hypothyroidism, and juvenile osteoporosis.\nInitial laboratory investigations revealed a serum calcium of 4.9 mg/dL with serum albumin of 4.4 g/dL. An ionized calcium of 0.61 mmol/L confirmed hypocalcemia. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was elevated at 280.7 pg/mL and there was evidence of severe deficiency in both 25(OH)D (<4 ng/mL) and 1,25(OH)2D (17.8 pg/mL). Nutritional labs revealed a low vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and zinc as described in . There were notable coagulopathies, with deficiencies in factors II (73%), V (27%), and VII (37%). Other labs revealed an elevated alkaline phosphatase of 290 ug/L and normal thyroid function with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.137 uIU/mL, free thyroxine of 0.8 ng/dL, and total thyroxine of 6.1 ug/dL. Renal function showed normal creatinine (0.5 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (9.0 mg/dL). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal (<1 mm/hr) and a celiac screen was negative (tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody <2 U/mL with normal IgA of 120 mg/dL). Urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio was low at 0.01 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram revealed a prolonged QTc of 498 milliseconds.\nThe patient did not have a history of apparent numbness, weakness, muscle cramps, or bone pain. In the prior few months, however, he was noted to go down steps with two feet, one step at a time, and this had been a change in behavior. He was raised in the Northeast United States in New York and was of Hispanic ethnicity. His mother described him as a picky eater. On further dietary recall, he was noted to eat potato chips, French fries, corn, crackers, pizza without cheese, and chicken nuggets. He mainly drank ginger ale and apple juice. His lifestyle was sedentary with most time spent indoors or riding on the train. There was no personal or family history of metabolic bone disease. He had no history of prolonged steroid use.\nGiven his hypocalcemia, treatment was initiated with intravenous calcium gluconate 2 grams every 2-3 hours with a goal total calcium of greater than 8 mg/dL so that he would be stable for orthopedic surgery. After 48 hours of intravenous calcium treatment, he underwent bilateral antegrade nailing of the bilateral femurs. He was started on vitamin D3 50,000 international units once weekly. Postoperatively, enteral calcium carbonate of 100 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours was ordered. However, due to his refusal to take enteral calcium, a nasogastric tube was placed and his dose was increased to 120 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours. Total calcium levels continued to improve and enteral calcium was slowly weaned to 60 mg/kg/day divided twice daily. By the day of discharge, his calcium level had improved to 9.9 mg/dL and 25(OH)D concentration improved to 13 ng/mL. He was discharged to a rehabilitation center for further feeding therapy and physical therapy.

There was no history of hematuria, dysuria, palpitations, chest pain, or jaundice. He had taken some treatment irregularly for these complaints, details of which were not known. On examination, he had severe respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema. His pulse rates were 155/min with all peripheral pulses well palpable; respiratory rates were 62/min with intercostal and subcostal recessions. He was anemic, hypertensive (blood pressure \u2013 140/86, >99th centile) and had generalized anasarca and abdominal wall cellulitis. There was no jaundice, rash, arthritis, lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly. Systemic examination revealed bilateral basal crepts; there was tachycardia, but no murmur.\nInvestigations revealed anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 6.3, microcytic hypochromic type), neutrophilic leukocytosis (total leukocyte count 14,800 with neutrophilia 87%) and renal dysfunction (blood urea 283 mg/dl, serum creatinine 3.9 mg/dl). The serum albumin levels were 1.6 gm/dl, cholesterol levels were 185 mg/dl and triglycerides of 472 mg/dl. The liver function tests were normal with a serum bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dl, alanine aminotransferase 14 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase of 28 IU/L. The serum sodium levels were 143 mEq/L and potassium 5.9 mEq/L, total calcium 7.9 mg/dl, phosphates 3.6 mg/dl and SAP 181 IU/L. The venous blood gas showed mild acidosis (bicarbonate levels 16.7 mEq/L). The urine examination showed nephrotic range proteinuria with microscopic hematuria and 8\u201310 WBC/hpf. Radiology revealed pulmonary edema on chest radiograph and minimal pericardial effusion on echocardiography. A diagnosis of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with abdominal wall cellulitis was made, and the child started on intravenous antibiotics, furosemide and antihypertensives.\nIn view of worsening renal functions and hyperkalemia, hemodialysis was initiated. The child received two blood transfusions. Further investigations revealed that antinuclear antibody and anti-streptolysin-O-antibody were negative, complement levels (C3) were low and the serology was positive for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] and anti-hepatitis B core antibody [IgG anti HBc] positive; and anti-HBeAg negative; DNA titers for viral load could not be done due to nonavailability). The anti-hepatitis C virus and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies were negative. The renal biopsy showed features of collapsing glomerulopathy []. The light microscopy showed 18 glomeruli of which 10 showed glomerular capillary tuft collapse, three were segmentally sclerosed and five appeared unremarkable. The interstitium showed edema and a diffuse 30\u201340% of the tubulointerstitial compartment showed chronic parenchymal changes with blood vessels having mild medial sclerosis. Immunofluorescence showed nonspecific deposition of C3, IgM (2+), IgG, IgA. Hepatitis B antigen deposits were present in the glomerular tufts. Based on these findings and the serology report, a diagnosis of hepatitis B associated collapsing glomerulopathy was made. The child was started on lamivudine; was continued on diuretics and antihypertensives. After 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy the child improved and became dialysis independent. After 1 month of hospital stay the child was discharged on iron, calcium supplements, lamivudine and antihypertensives (amlodepine and furosemide). His blood urea and creatinine levels were 114 mg/dl and 1.9 mg/dl, respectively at discharge. At 6 months follow-up, the child was normotensive, with minimal edema and his kidney function test were urea of 86 mg/dl and creatinine 1.1 mg/dl.

    "question": "A 55-year-old man was diagnosed with \u201clumbar muscle strain\u201d at a local hospital after complains of low back pain for 3 months. However, no significant improvement was seen after symptomatic treatment (specific treatment unknown). Two months later, the patient developed back pain with bilateral pain in the rib area. On April 21, 2018, enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) showed a small amount of chronic inflammatory and fibroproliferative lesions in the lower lobe of both lungs; a small amount of effusion on both sides of the thoracic cavity, osteoporosis of the vertebrae, ribs, and sternum with multiple bone resorption and destruction, consider plasmacytoma possible. Blood biochemical tests suggest elevated globulin (88.2 g/L).\nWhen the patient visited our hospital, there were no obvious positive findings on physical examination, except for pale lips, conjunctiva, and nail bed. Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count, 3400 cells/\u03bcL; hemoglobin, 86 g/L; platelets,118,000 cells/\u03bcL; total protein, 113 g/L; albumin, 28 g/L; creatinine, 58 \u03bcmol/L; calcium, 2.24 mmol/L; \u03b22-microglobin, 2.84 mg/L. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 66.79 g/L, but IgA and IgM were below normal levels, blood lambda light chain was 19.8 g/L, and the ratio of kappa/lambda was 0.01. Immunofixation electrophoresis showed an increase in monoclonal IgG and lambda in the blood. Bone marrow smear suggested elevated plasma cells (plasma cells 23%). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results of CD138 monoclonal antibody sorting cells showed 8% positive for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) rearrangement and 10% positive for 13q deletion. The diagnosis was multiple myeloma [subtype IgG/lambda Durie-Salmon stage IIIA, International Staging System (ISS) stage II]. This patient was a known carrier of HBV for more than 20 years. His elder brother had also been diagnosed with multiple myeloma (subtype IgG/kappa) in 2008 at the age of 56 years. Before initiation of treatment for multiple myeloma, the patient was seropositive for HBsAg (39 IU/mL), anti-HBe, and anti-HBc. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 64 U/L (normal range <45 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 69 U/L (normal range <50 U/L). Serum HBV-DNA was 161 IU/mL.\nThe patient received a 3-week cycle of PCD (Bortezomib 2.3 mg and Cyclophosphamide 0.4 g on day 1,4,8,11+ Dexamethasone 20 mg on day 1\u20132, 4\u20135, 8\u20139, 11\u201312). Entecavir was administered as a prophylaxis against HBV reactivation, and HBV-DNA was monitored since the start of PCD therapy. The patient tolerated the chemotherapy regimen well, and there were no obvious adverse effects. After 1 cycle of therapy, the serum HBV-DNA was undetectable. HBsAg turned negative after 2 months and was also negative during the 2 years of follow-up. However, anti-HBe and anti-HBc were still positive. After 4 courses of PCD therapy, the patient's immunofixation electrophoresis turned negative, and the free light chain returned to normal, indicating a stringent complete response (sCR). Subsequently, his peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were collected and he was consistently treated with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous HSC transplantation as consolidation treatment, 10 months after the initial diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The patient continues to remain in sCR at 26 months of follow-up. During subsequent treatment and follow-up, HBsAg continued to be negative and HBV-DNA continued to fall below the detection limit.

    "question": "A 72-year-old Japanese woman presented to our hospital for further examination because of a high fever, diarrhea, intermittent spotting into urine-absorbing pads, and constant fluid discharge from the vagina. The patient had been taking Lactobacillus preparation, potassium chloride, vitamin D analogue, vitamin B12, vitamin B complex, and iron sulfate for diarrhea and subsequent malabsorption. Warfarin was also prescribed for deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs. She underwent radical hysterectomy and radiotherapy for the treatment of carcinoma of the uterine cervix 35 years previously. After the treatment of cervix cancer, she developed bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple episodes of ileus. Thus, right percutaneous nephrostomy, left nephrectomy, ileoascending anastomosis, and colostomy in the transverse colon were performed (Figure ). These treatments caused radiation colitis and short bowel syndrome, resulting in diarrhea, malabsorption, and protein-losing enteropathy.\nPhysical examination revealed anemia and leg edema. Laboratory examinations revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 266 \u00d7 104/mm3 and hemoglobin, 8.4 mg/dL), hypoproteinemia (total protein, 4.5 g/dL and albumin, 1.0 g/dL), hypokalemia (potassium, 2.5 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (calcium, 6.6 mg/dL), and hypophosphatemia (phosphorus, 2.1 mg/dL). A slight elevation in the C-reactive protein level was noted (1.73 mg/dL), whereas the white blood cell count was decreased (3180/mm3; neutrophil, 74.0%).\nAlthough fistula formation was suspected as a cause of intermittent blood spotting and constant fluid discharge from the vagina, computed tomography (CT) scanning with contrast media, colonoscopy, and video capsule enteroscopy examinations were nondiagnostic. The patient accidentally slipped and fell on the floor and hit her hip. Subsequently, massive bleeding from the vagina occurred, and pelvic examinations by a gynecologist revealed enterovaginal fistulas. A colposcopy examination using a videoscope (GIF TYPE PQ260; Olympus) showed two fistulas with active bleeding (Figure A-C). Contrast medium (meglumine sodium amidotrizoate) was injected into the fistulas via the videoscope, and CT scanning confirmed the fistula formations between the ileum and vagina (Figure D,E). As the bleeding was uncontrollable, ileocecal resection was performed. Discharge of the blood and fluid resolved postoperatively.\nThree months postoperatively, she presented with a low-grade fever. Urinalysis revealed bacteriuria, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia species were detected by urine culture. A CT scan showed fluid collection in the pelvic cavity (Figure A). Colonoscopy from the anus revealed mucosal edema (Figure B) and stricture (Figure C) of the sigmoid colon. After the injection of contrast medium, a fistula in the bladder was visualized (Figure D, arrowhead), in addition to the pooling of contrast medium in the descending colon (Figure D,E, arrows). Consequently, a colovesical fistula was diagnosed. The urinary tract infection because of the fistula was conservatively treated with an injection of cefmetazole. The patient has been free from infection-related symptoms for 4 months even after discontinuing the antibiotic treatment.

    "question": "A 53-year-old Caucasian male presented with a one-month history of chest wall and back pain, and right-sided leg weakness and pain. Past medical history was significant for HIV infection and AIDS diagnosed about 27 years ago. He had a history of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, rectal condylomata, and toxoplasmosis, and he had been taking Atripla\u00ae over the last 2 decades. His CD4 count had been >1000/\u03bcl and HIV viral load undetectable. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed enhancing soft tissue lesions involving the posterolateral right 8th rib and the posterior left 12th rib; fracture of the left posterior 7th rib; lytic lesions involving the thoracic (T) 4, T12, and lumbar (L)1 vertebral bodies, and a large lesion involving the right sacroiliac joint. CT guided biopsy of the right sacroiliac mass revealed plasma cell neoplasm with \u03ba light chain restriction. His WBC was 8.65 \u00d7 109/L, hemoglobin 12 g/dl, platelet count 433\u00d7 109/L, serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dl, albumin 2.6 g/dl, and serum calcium 10.4 mg/dl. SPEP and IFE demonstrated an IgG \u03ba M-protein at 1.64 g/dl. Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration revealed \u03ba light chain restricted- plasma cells at 10%. FISH analysis showed 1 extra copy of 1q and a 13q14 deletion. The patient was diagnosed with MM (Stage III by International Staging System) with extensive medullary plasmacytoma. He continued his HAART and was treated with 6 cycles of VCd regimen (bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone). He also received a total of 30 Gy fractioned irradiation of the spine and the iliac crests. Due to the concern of possible progression in bony lytic lesions, his chemotherapy regimen was switched to VRd (bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone). After 3 cycles of VRd, the patient achieved a very good partial response. Because of the aggressiveness of his MM, the patient then underwent high dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). He received pegfilgrastin for stem cell mobilization and successfully collected 8.3 \u00d7 106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight with only one-day leukapheresis. He received high dose melphalan (200 mg/m2) conditioning and autologous HSCT. His HSCT was relatively uneventful. He had an appropriate count recovery, and restaging at 3 months post HSCT showed no evidence of M-protein in SPEP and UPEP.

Patient endorsed tingling sensation in hand since a month which was intermittent and unrelated to wrist movement. She denied history of preceding trauma and swelling in hands. There was no history of similar complaints in the past or any prior surgery. She denied complaints like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Tingling in hands was not associated with paresthesia in other extremities and sensory or motor deficits. Patient was a known case of multidrug resistant tuberculosis and was being treated with the following drugs for two months: amoxicillin-clavulanate, ethionamide, intramuscular capreomycin, linezolid, and para-aminosalicylate (PAS) granules. Patient was afebrile and her initial vital signs were normal with a pulse of 78/min and blood pressure of 110/76 mm of Hg. On examination, flattening of chest wall on the left side was noted. Trail's sign was positive with a deviation of the trachea to the left side. On auscultation of lung fields, breath sounds were diminished on the left. These findings suggested presence of tuberculous fibrosis in the left lung. No other stigmata of TB were noted and rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nInitial blood-work at the time of presentation revealed a low serum calcium level of 6.98 mg/dL. Patient was hospitalized and detailed investigations were done. Coexisting with hypocalcemia, other electrolyte abnormalities noted were as follows: serum sodium of 130 mEq/L, potassium of 1.8 mEq/L, chloride of 95 mEq/L, calcium of 6.98 mg/dL, and magnesium of 0.5 mg/dL. Serum albumin was 4 g/dL. Serum creatinine was normal and remained so throughout the course of hospitalization. The arterial blood gas evaluation showed metabolic alkalosis without respiratory compensation with pH of 7.5, HCO3 of 30 mEq/L, and PaCO2 of 30 mmHg. Routine urine examination revealed a 2\u20134 pus cells, 1-2 RBCs, and 1-2 epithelial cells, in the absence of proteinuria and glycosuria. Urine calcium/creatinine ratio was 0.49 (>0.2), which confirmed hypercalciuria. Urinary prostaglandin-E level was not performed as this assay is not readily available in our institute.\nVitamin D and serum parathyroid levels were found to be in the normal range, thus ruling out hypovitaminosis D and secondary hyperparathyroidism, respectively. Patient was treated symptomatically; injectable calcium, magnesium, and potassium were administered to correct electrolyte abnormalities. Due to the association of aminoglycoside antibiotics with alterations in electrolyte levels, capreomycin was discontinued. Subsequently, the electrolytes started to rise after two days of stopping capreomycin (). Patient was discharged once her symptoms resolved and the serum electrolytes were normalized. On follow-up, there were no complains of tingling sensations or carpopedal spasms and electrolytes remained to be in the normal range.

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman with a past medical history of diabetes type 1 associated with latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood diagnosed from the age of 11 years, ESRD secondary to diabetic nephropathy on hemodialysis (diagnosed in December 2017), bilateral diabetic retinopathy, ovarian cyst, hypertension, and anxiety was brought to the emergency department for evaluation of intractable abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. These health issues started 2 days prior to emergency visit at the hospital. The patient has a history of multiple admissions with similar presentations. She was found to have large ascites.\nIt was observed that the patient was a young woman, anxious at the moment but alert and oriented \u00d7 3. She was pale but had no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. Her blood pressure was 218/108 mm Hg. Her cardiac and respiratory exam was unremarkable.\nAbdominal examination showed abdominal distension, mild tenderness, and positive shifting dullness. The normal bowel sounds, no dilated veins and no palpable masses were found in the examination of the abdomen. Extremities exam was remarkable for bilateral +1 leg edema.\nHer laboratory investigations revealed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 42 mg/dL, serum creatinine (Cr) of 6.1 mg/dL, serum calcium of 8.8 mg/dL and serum phosphorus of 4.8 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) of 12.0, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.6, and platelets of 428. The patient\u2019s international normalized ration (INR) on checking was within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast was significant for moderate to be marked as abdominal ascites with hepatomegaly and a somewhat reticular pattern of enhancement suggesting possible cirrhosis. Hepatitis B and C serology had been negative in the previous admissions of the patient. Liver function test (LFT) of the patient was also conducted which was within normal limits. Therapeutic/diagnostic paracentesis was done and resulted as: fluid appearance of xanthochromia; fluid WBC of 892/\u00b5L; fluid red blood cell (RBC) of 5,120/\u00b5L; fluid polynuclear WBC of 0%; fluid mononuclear WBCs of 0%; fluid lymphocytes of 34%; fluid unclassified cell of 66%; fluid glucose of 134 mg/dL; fluid total protein of 5.7g/dL; fluid albumin of 2.0g/dL; fluid lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) of 226 IU/L; and fluid amylase of 25 IU/L. Serum albumin from December 12, 2018 was 2.7 g/dL. SAAG was calculated to be 0.7. Cytology showed chronic inflammatory and rare mesothelial cells, and no malignant cells were identified. Culture of ascitic fluid did not grow any organisms. With predominance of lymphocytic cells, ascetic fluid was sent for acid fast bacillus (AFB) and Gold QuantiFERON test was requested. All results were negative.\nHepatobiliary ultrasonographic (US) exam with Doppler did not show any finding suggesting portal vein thrombosis or Budd-Chiari syndrome.\nIn the previous admission, CT scan abdomen/pelvis showed a complex ovarian cyst and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125, U/mL) was slightly elevated. Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) did not reveal any ovarian cyst. Echo did not show any elevation in right ventricular pressure with ejection fraction (EF) of 60%.\nBased on the detailed workup, hepatic, cardiac, infectious and malignant causes for ascites were ruled out. The diagnosis of ascites of nephrogenic origin was made.\nBecause of her comorbidities and non-compliance with treatment, the patient was a poor candidate for intra-abdominal dialysis and renal transplant. The patient has been treated conservatively with salt/fluid restriction and intensive hemodialysis sessions with ultrafiltration. A gradual reduction in ascites was noted and abdominal girth had been reduced by about 40% with management. But because of her non-compliance with hemodialysis sessions, the patient keep presenting to the emergency room with the same complain. Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL.",

    "question": "A 39-year-old female patient, who had black stool twice without obvious inducement 3 days ago, accompanied by dizziness, and no other symptoms such as abdominal distension, abdominal pain, cold, and fever. After symptomatic treatment in the local hospital, the condition did not improve, so came to our hospital for further treatment and was hospitalized with gastrointestinal bleeding. Physical examination: T 36.7\u202f\u00b0C, P 78/min, R 20/min, BP 99/62 mmHg, moderate anemia (Hb 85 g/L), no other abnormal signs and previous history of other diseases. After admission, through the preliminary examination of abdominal CT scanning, the results showed that hepatic cysts, small calcifications in the left lobe of the liver, and gallbladder inflammation, but no abnormalities in the intestinal tract. Subsequently, through electronic gastroscopy and enteroscopy, the results of the gastroscopy showed that patchy erythema could be seen in the gastric antrum, while in other parts of the stomach, the mucosa was smooth, the folds were intact, and the gastric peristalsis was good, which was diagnosed as superficial gastritis. The enteroscopy showed that, when the electronic enteroscope was inserted into the end of the ileum, a small amount of brown liquid could be seen, the intestinal mucosa was smooth, and the ileocecal valve is good. While a lot of coffee-like liquid could be seen in the colon cavity, but no bleeding site was found. At this time, we discussed and evaluated the relevant research results and case data, and highly suspected the possibility of intestinal vascular disease. In order to make a clear diagnosis and locate the bleeding site, further capsule endoscopy was performed (the whole photography time of capsule endoscopy was 11 h and 30 min). After the capsule endoscopy was swallowed, it was sent to the duodenum under the gastroscope, and entered the colon in 3 h and 27 min. Fortunately, some gains were obtained, at 48 min, there were a lot of fluid and blood clots in the upper and middle segment of the jejunum could be seen, but the entire field of vision was poorly blurred and no bleeding point was still found (). Through the results of capsule endoscopy, we were full of confidence in the previous judgment, and initially positioned the bleeding site in the jejunum.\nAfter a week of treatment through nutritional support, rehydration and correction of anemia, the patient still had recurrent and intermittent black stool, and her condition was not very stable. Therefore, we decided to explore by laparotomy []. Based on the results of capsule endoscopy, the dark black part of the jejunum was found, and then the jejunum was cut at about 5 cm above it for intraoperative enteroscopy. The bleeding spot was finally found (located at about 10 cm from jejunum to the ligament of Traitz) and then the hemostasis was stopped by suture. Finally, it was diagnosed as jejunal telangiectasia complicated with bleeding (). After hemostasis during the operation, a thorough and careful exploration of other intestines was performed, and no other bleeding sites were found. After operation, the patient's condition was stable and the symptoms of hematochezia and anemia were controlled through symptomatic treatment.

    "question": "A 42-year-old male was hospitalized in July 2008 with dizziness and mild dyspnea lasting two months. He also complained of intermittent febrile sensations and night sweats. His medical history revealed three open heart surgeries before admission. The patient underwent open mitral commisurotomy with mitral valve stenosis in 1986. After five years, he underwent mitral valve replacement with a Carbomedics prosthetic valve (CarboMedics, Inc.; Austin, TX, USA) in 1991. In 2005, his tricuspid valve was also replaced with a St. Jude Medical prosthesis (St. Jude Medical Inc.; Minneapolis, MN, USA) due to severe tricuspid regurgitation. He also had a history of atrial fibrillation and cardiac liver cirrhosis. The patient was a stock farmer and had buried cattle afflicted by brucellosis one year before this admission.\nUpon admission, his vital signs showed a blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg, pulse rate of 106 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min and body temperature of 37.5\u2103. Irregular heartbeats without murmurs were heard on auscultation and his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response rate of 112 beats per minute. Laboratory studies revealed anemia and leukopenia with a hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL, a total white cell count of 2600/mm3 (66% neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes, 11% monocytes) and a platelet count of 191000/mm3. The C-reactive protein level of 5.76 mg/dL was elevated. The peripheral blood smears showed normocytic hypochromic erythrocytes with some fragmented cells.\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated a very small echogenic mass (3\u00d78 mm) attached to the inferomedial portion of the prosthetic mitral valve annulus (; ) which was not seen on the last TEE. The function of the prosthetic mitral valve and tricuspid prosthetic valve was normal. Under suspicion of infective endocarditis, six blood cultures were drawn for the first 48 hours and inoculated into an automated system (BACTEC; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA). Because gram-negative coccobacilli were isolated from the initial blood culture after two days of incubation, an empirical antibiotic regimen of ceftriaxone (2 g/day) and gentamicin 3 mg/kg/day was started. The serum (tube) agglutination test against Brucella species showed a positive titer of 1:1280. The isolates of the automated hemoculture system were identified as Brucella species after six days and further identification of Brucella strains revealed B. abortus.\nA diagnosis of BE on the prosthetic mitral valve was considered in this patient and specific antibiotics were started. The patient was given a triple combination therapy consisting of oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day, oral rifampin 600 mg once daily and an intramuscular injection of streptomycin 1000 mg once daily. After 12 days of treatment, his fever recurred and streptomycin was switched to intravenous gentamycin (5 mg/kg/day). Although surgery was initially planned, the patient refused reoperation at that time. Therefore, he was treated with antibiotics alone under close follow-up. After 12 days of treatment, the blood cultures were negative. Three weeks after treatment, the follow-up echocardiography demonstrated no vegetations in the prosthetic mitral valve (). After seven weeks of hospitalization, he was discharged with oral doxycycline 200 mg/day. Doxycycline was maintained for one year and his Brucella titers decreased to <1:160. The patient has been regularly followed in the outpatient clinic. At present, five years after discharge, the patient remains free of symptoms.

    "question": "A white British, 78-year-old previously healthy female, non-smoker and with no known pulmonary disease, was admitted with collapse and shortness of breath with arterial oxygen saturations of haemoglobin of 80% on room air. The background included a history of persistent dry cough for 3 months without any other complaint or systemic symptoms. Her past medical history comprised of type 2 diabetes, increased uric acid and ongoing pain in the right knee. Her medication history consisted of gliclazide, allopurinol and diclofenac. The patient denied any recent travel or contact with animals (even pets). Physical examination revealed central cyanosis, tachypnoea, bilateral reduction in breath sounds and right-sided bronchial breathing. Cardiac examination was normal. There were no adenopathy noted. Arterial blood gases analysis on 5 litres of O2 per min showed mixed acidaemia. Serum biochemistry revealed raised urea (15.1 mmol/L) and creatinine (114 umol/L) levels consistent with acute kidney injury, positive D-dimmer's levels and increased CRP (48.2 mg/L). Chest radiography showed a loss of volume in the right lung (Figure ) and an electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 94 bpm, left axis deviation and an old inferior myocardial infarction. At this time the patient was started on treatment for both a possible community acquired pneumonia (benzyl penicillin and clarythromycin) and for pulmonary thromboembolism (therapeutic doses of Dalteparin). The patient was stable for 48 hours but then her oxygen requirements increased progressively. Contrast-enhanced chest CT scan and CT pulmonary arteriography with venous phase imaging failed to demonstrate any evidence of pulmonary artery thrombus. However thrombus, with associated fibrosis and volume loss, was seen to affect one of the right lower lobe pulmonary veins (Figure ). An echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal sized left ventricle with good function, normal aortic and mitral valves. The right heart although poorly visualized, appeared to be mildly enlarged with moderate function. The patient was started on methylprednisolone 1 g once a day and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nThe patient continued to deteriorate over the next 24 hours following admission to the ICU. She developed biochemical and electrocardiographic evidence of an acute anterior-lateral myocardial infarction and aspirin, clopidogrel and simvastatin were added to her anticoagulation therapy. Unfortunately the patient's oxygen requirements continued to increase and she was ventilated, initially supported by biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and then subsequently by invasive mechanical ventilation. Over the next eight days, despite maximal therapy she continued to deteriorate and died from multiple organ failure. What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?",

    "question": "A 51-year-old Chinese woman presented with 16-month history of proteinuria and hypertension (160/90 mmHg) which was noticed during a routine examination. She was treated with Valsartan and blood pressure was controlled around 120/70 mmHg. Three months before admission, her urinary protein excretion was 2.12 g/d, serum albumin 36.4 g/L (normal range: 40\u201355 g/L), and serum creatinine 0.72 mg/dl (normal range: 0.50\u20131.50 mg/dl). One month before admission, her urinary protein excretion increased to 4.6 g/d, and serum creatinine increased to 1.16 mg/dl.\nThe patient was discovered Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 3 months prior to her admission, but not knowing how she got the infection. HCV-RNA was negative at that time and she did not receive any antiviral treatment. Family history was of no significance.\nOn admission, her blood pressure was 131/84 mmHg, temperature 36.7 \u00b0C, heart rate 75/min, and respiratory rate 18/min. There was mild edema around the eyelid, and there was no organomegaly. Other physical examinations were normal.\nAfter admission, urine dipstick revealed proteinuria 2+. Urine sediment analysis revealed red blood cell 6 to 8 cells per high power field without white blood cell. Urinary protein excretion was 4.03 to 4.49 g/24 h. The urine albumin creatinine ratio was 2512.42 mg/gCr (normal range: < 30 mg/gCr). Her serum total protein was 58.4 g/L (normal range: 65\u201385 g/L), albumin was 35.3 to 29.7 g/L, and serum creatinine was 0.87 mg/dl to 1.03 mg/dl with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 64.33 to 63.39 ml/min/1.73m2. Her white blood cell (WBC) was 6.10 \u00d7 109 cells/L (normal range: 3.5\u20139.5 \u00d7 109 cells/L), hemoglobin was 101 g/L (normal range: 115\u2013150 g/L) and platelet was 196 \u00d7 109 cells/L (normal range: 125\u2013300 \u00d7 109 cells/L). Serum anti-HCV antibody was still positive and serum HCV-RNA was undetectable. Serum cryoglobulin was negative. She was negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti- human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Treponema pallidum antibody (TP-Ab). Other laboratory data revealed serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G was 5.42 g/L (normal range: 7.23\u201316.85 g/L), IgA was 1.37 g/L (normal range: 0.69\u20133.82 g/L), and IgM was 0.60 g/L (normal range: 0.63\u20132.77 g/L). Serum C3 level was 0.674 g/L (normal range: 0.60\u20131.50 g/L), and C4 level was 0.154 g/L (normal range: 0.12\u20130.36 g/L). Serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) did not identify monoclonal immunoglobulins. Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti- phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies were all negative. Echocardiography and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\nThe patient underwent the first renal biopsy on February 26th, 2018. Direct immunofluorescence (IF) examination of frozen renal tissue revealed IgG +++, IgM +, C3 +++, C1q trace, C4d +++, \u03ba++, \u03bb++++, IgG1 +, IgG2 ++, IgG3 +++, IgG4 +, which were deposited along the capillary wall and mesangial area of the glomeruli (Fig. a-f). Light microscopic examination showed that 10/47 glomeruli were globally sclerosed. Other glomeruli showed a MPGN pattern with severe mesangial cell and matrix proliferation with nodular lesions, thickening of the capillary wall and double contour formation (Fig. g). Congo red staining for amyloid was negative. Electron microscopic examination revealed electron-dense deposits in the mesangial, subendothelial and subepithelial area. Subendothelial edema was observed in segmental capillary loops (Fig. h). Hence the pathological diagnosis was immune-complex mediated MPGN due to polyclonal immunoglobulins deposition.\nTo explore the etiology and pathogenesis of MPGN, the differential diagnosis and further examinations were performed. Autoimmune diseases were excluded as the absence of antoantibodies and relevant clinical manifestations. The anti-HCV antibodies were positive in the serum, but the serum HCV-RNA was negative, as were the serum cryoglobulin, serum C3 and C4 and HCV antigen staining on the renal tissue, excluding the diagnosis of HCV related MPGN. Other chronic infections were not identified. According to the IF findings by dominant IgG3 and \u03bb light chain, monoclonal gammopathy associated MPGN was suspected. Bone marrow aspiration smear revealed 1.5% plasma cells. Bone marrow biopsy showed a few plasma cells with normal change. CD38 positive cells accounted for 0.28% of bone marrow cells, but no evidence of monoclonal light chain restricted expression as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). She was treated with olmesartan 40 mg/d, ramipril 10 mg/d, amlodipine 10 mg/d and metoprolol 25 mg/d, blood pressure was controlled around 120/70 mmHg. She did not receive any anti-HCV treatment.\nSix months after renal biopsy, her proteinuria increased to 5.57 g/d, with serum albumin 31.8 g/L, serum creatinine 1.29 mg/dl. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil and tripterygium wilfordii were prescribed. One month later, her proteinuria decreased to 2.47 g/d with a serum albumin 27.7 g/L, serum creatinine 0.97 mg/dl. However, her serum creatinine increased to 1.96 mg/dl, and a repeated renal biopsy was performed 9 months later in November 19th, 2018.\nIF examination of frozen renal tissue revealed IgG ++++, C3 +++, C1q negative, C4d +++ (immunohistochemistry), \u03ba trace, \u03bb++++, IgG1 negative, IgG2 negative, IgG3 +++,IgG4 negative, which were deposited along the capillary wall and mesangial area of the glomeruli (Fig. a-f). Light microscopic examination showed that 2/20 glomeruli were globally sclerosed. Other glomeruli showed a MPGN pattern(Fig. g). More prominent tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis than the first time, with focal loss of brush border of the tubular epithelial cells. There was moderate interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes, monocytes and a few eosinophils. Electron microscopic examination revealed electron-dense deposits in the mesangial, subendothelial and subepithelial area. (Fig. h). The patient was diagnosed with proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG3\u03bb deposition (PGNMID). Further testes showed serum free \u03ba chain was 16.8 mg/L (normal range: 3.30\u201319.40 mg/L), free \u03bb chain was 25.3 mg/L (normal range: 5.71\u201326.3 mg/L), and the \u03ba/\u03bb ratio was 0.664 (normal range: 0.26\u20131.65). Serum and urine IFE were still negative for monoclonal immunoglobulin. Repeated serum anti-HCV antibody detection was negative without anti-HCV treatment.\nTherapy and follw-up: The patient was treated with prednisone (40 mg/d) and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/d), her serum creatinine decreased to 1.47 mg/dl and remained stable until March 2019. Then she suffer an episode of herpes zoster, cyclophosphamide was discontinued, and the patient\u2019s serum creatinine increased to 2.54 mg/dl.

    "question": "We present the case of a 62-year-old gentleman, who was brought into the emergency department (ED) by ambulance with a history of dry cough, low grade fever, worsening shortness of breath for 4 days, and pleuritic sounding chest pain, which was different to when he had a pulmonary embolism approximately ten months ago. His past medical history included type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, treated malignant neoplasm of the base of tongue, diverticular disease, essential hypertension, and previous provoked pulmonary embolism. Before admission, he was living independently with his wife. His exercise tolerance was restricted to 10 yards with the assistance of a walking stick. He was an exsmoker and used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day but stopped smoking a few years previously.\nOn admission, he was pyrexial with a temperature of 38.2\u00b0C, oxygen saturations 98% on 28% FiO2, blood pressure 73/35 mmHg, and pulse rate 92 bpm. Initial treatment included oxygen 28% FiO2 via a venturi mask and fluid resuscitation for hypotension. Physical examination revealed bibasal crepitations on auscultation of chest and a swollen and tender right leg. Initial investigations revealed deranged biochemical markers () and opacification affecting the right midzone of the lung ().\nInitial laboratory workup summarised in .\nIn view of the clinical presentation and raised d-dimer, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed which reported right upper lobe consolidation with subtle peripheral ground glass opacification in the left upper lobe and both lower lobes, suggestive of early COVID-19 infection (). Moreover, his troponin I levels were markedly elevated and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment depression and T-wave inversion in the anterolateral chest leads. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function with an akinetic and rounded apical septal wall.\nOn account of the history, examination, and investigations, he was treated as suspected COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia (CURB-65 score = 2, moderate severity), COVID-19 myocarditis, and sepsis, leading to multiorgan failure. In view of poor physiological reserve and comorbidities, the ceiling of care was decided to be ward level care and noninvasive ventilation if needed. However, he began to improve clinically, became normotensive, and was able to be weaned off oxygen day 3 after admission. By that time, his swab detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.\nFollowing initial improvement, he suddenly developed a new, increased oxygen demand, requiring titration of humidified oxygen up to 10 litres. Chest physiotherapy helped him bring up copious volumes of thick sputum, and he was stable for most of the day with oxygen saturations of 93%. Later that day, he suddenly deteriorated and becoming cyanotic and critically unwell. Oxygen saturations were 80% on 15 litres nonrebreathe mask, and he was significantly tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 40/minute. An urgent portable chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax causing mediastinal shift ().\nAn intercostal drain was inserted on an emergency basis and the patient improved slightly over the next 24 hours though he still required oxygen via a high flow nasal cannula system to maintain oxygen saturations of 92% or more. Despite the chest drain and the addition of thoracic suction, the lung did not reexpand. He continued to deteriorate rapidly, was unable to tolerate further pleural procedures, and died.

    "question": "In May 2009, a 30-year-old woman came to the emergency room (ER) with a five-day history of acute progressive dyspnea on exertion (NYHA class III). In 2007, ductal carcinoma in situ was diagnosed by biopsy during pregnancy. In 2008, after a full-term delivery, findings on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound of the right breast revealed diffuse microcalcification and skin thickening of the right breast, and metastatic axillary lymph nodes. The patient refused further management and was lost to follow up until the ER visit.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 126/76 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 beats per min, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and body temperature was 36.7\u2103. A chest radiograph showed that the lung field was clear. Results of arterial blood gas analysis in room air indicated hypoxemia: pH 7.446, pCO2 28.2 mm Hg, pO2 44.3 mm Hg, HCO3 19.1 mmol/L, SaO2 76.8%. D-dimers were elevated to 2.59 \u00b5g/mL (normal, <0.39 \u00b5g/mL) with an elevated troponin I level to 0.24 ng/mL (normal, <0.04 ng/mL) and a brain natriuretic peptide of 774 pg/mL (normal, <100 pg/mL). Diffuse enlargement of the right breast with skin thickening and many enlarged axillary lymph nodes consistent with locally advanced breast cancer was observed on CT.\nOn the second day of admission, the patient was consulted with the cardiology department for possible preoperative cardiac evaluation. An electrocardiogram showed an S1Q3T3 pattern with inverted or flattened T waves in leads V1 through V4. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function with right ventricular enlargement and free wall hypokinesia sparing the apex. In addition, the echocardiogram showed typical findings of acute pulmonary thromboembolism with a D-shaped left ventricle, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 61 mm Hg.\nOther laboratory tests showed the following results: white blood cell 7,900/mm3 with normal differential counts, hemoglobin15.4 g/dL, platelets 144,000/mm3, alanine aminotransferase 50 IU/L (normal, 0 to 40 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase 218 IU/L (normal, 0 to 40 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL (normal, 0.2 to 1.2 mg/dL), C-reactive protein 0.81 mg/dL (normal, 0 to 0.30 mg/dL), prothrombin time (PT) international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.36 (normal, 0.8 to 1.2), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 45.7 seconds (normal, 27.0 to 45.0 seconds), fibrinogen of 196 mg/dL (normal, 200 to 400 mg/dL), and fibrin degradation products (FDP) of 1 : 2 positive (normal, negative). A peripheral blood smear showed increased numbers of schistocytes and reticulocytes consistent with MAHA ().\nWe measured serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in view of preexisting information on VEGF, a critical angiogenic molecule and IL-6, a multifunctional cytokine promoting tumor growth. Serum VEGF levels were 26.9 pg/mL on the second day in the hospital and 9.5 pg/mL on the third day in the hospital (normal, 88.7 to 1,048.7 pg/mL); IL-6 levels were 50.3 pg/mL and 25.6 pg/mL on the second and third days, respectively (normal range, 0.4 to 8.6 pg/mL).\nAnticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin was startedunder the clinical diagnosis of submassive acute pulmonary thromboembolism. While no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism was observed on pulmonary CT angiography (), an echocardiogram showed acute right ventricular pressure overload (), and a perfusion lung scan showed multiple small wedge-shaped perfusion defects throughout both lungs (). Therefore, with a diagnosis of PTTM based on clinical and laboratory findings, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and received 1 mg/kg enoxaparin subcutaneously, 0.05 mg/kg dexamethasone intravenously, and 2 mg warfarin sodium orally.\nOn the third day of admission, repeated transthoracic echocardiogram showed additional significant right ventricular pressure overload with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg. Abnormal liver function was the result of either passive congestion or hepatic metastasis, although the initial CT did not show definite systemic metastasis. The patient was scheduled to undergo surgical breast biopsy and appropriate chemotherapy, however, her general condition showed rapid deterioration, and she died within 48 hours of admission.

    "question": "A 56-year-old man presented to the emergency room with progressively worsening shortness of breath and chest discomfort of one week duration. He had associated nonproductive cough for one week but denied any calf pain, leg swelling, hemoptysis, recent travel, recent surgeries, fever, or chills. His past medical history was notable for hypertension that was well controlled on lisinopril. He was also prescribed with 50 mg of clomiphene citrate 2 years ago due to low testosterone. He did not take any other medications and denied any smoking history. He denied any family history of blood clots or bleeding disorders.\nOn physical examination, his temperature was 97.8 F, respiratory rate was 26 breaths/min, blood pressure was 109/58 mm Hg, heart rate was 134 beats/min, and SpO2 was 96% on 6 liters nasal cannula. He had normal heart sounds without any murmurs and rubs and had clear lungs. He had trace pedal edema bilaterally without any calf tenderness. Laboratory results include leukocytes of 15.4 \u00d7 109/L, hemoglobin of 15.8 g/dL, platelets of 207 \u00d7 109/L, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, and troponin I <0.05 ng/ml initially, but later plateaued at 0.10 ng/ml.\nElectrocardiogram on admission showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete right bundle branch block with S1Q3T3 pattern. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of chest revealed acute large volume pulmonary embolism in bilateral main pulmonary arteries, lobar, and segmental branches of all lobes with mild right heart strain (as shown in ). Venous Doppler showed acute deep vein thrombosis in the right lower extremity involving the popliteal and posterior tibial veins. Echocardiogram was done which revealed a systolic ejection fraction of 55\u201365% with mildly decreased right ventricular systolic function.\nThe patient was started on a high flow nasal cannula initially for respiratory distress and then eventually was weaned to room air. He was started on heparin drip for anticoagulation that was later switched to rivaroxaban. Since clomiphene citrate (CC) was thought to be a contributing factor for pulmonary embolism, it was stopped, and he was referred to follow-up with a hematologist to evaluate for prothrombotic risk. His further workup for hypercoagulable disorders including anticardiolipin antibodies, factor V Leiden mutation and prothrombin gene mutation has been negative. He was also recommended to have age-appropriate screening for malignancy. What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?",

    "question": "A 60-year-old Chinese male presented to the hospital with acute shortness of breath and lower limb swelling. He has a past medical history of stroke disease, chronic kidney disease, and ischaemic cardiomyopathy with a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. His cardiovascular risk factors include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia.\nClinical examination revealed bibasal crepitations with bilateral pitting oedema. The blood pressure on admission was 150/87 mmHg with sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 129 beats per minute.\nInitial arterial blood gas (ABG) on admission () revealed Type 2 respiratory failure, while chest X-ray done showed bilateral pulmonary congestion.\nHe was initially started on non-invasive ventilation and intravenous frusemide and glyceryl trinitrate infusion. Despite initial clinical improvement, the patient became increasingly restless with worsening hypoxaemia and decision was made for intubation and mechanical ventilation. However, he suffered a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest peri-intubation with a low-flow time of 20 min before return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).\nHe was started on our institution\u2019s protocolized post-cardiac arrest care bundle () which included continuous rSO2 monitoring and TTM with mild induced hypothermia at 33\u00b0C. An oesophageal probe was inserted for core body temperature monitoring. Initial ABG post-ROSC revealed a Type 2 respiratory failure with pH 7.14, pCO2 54, pO2 110, HCO3 18, and SaO2 97%. Patient was sedated and paralyzed and ventilator settings were optimized to correct the respiratory acidosis. Patient was ventilated with a tidal volume of 7 mL/kg predicted body weight and at a ventilator rate of 28 breaths per minute. Initial cerebral oximetry revealed an rSO2 66% (left) and 67% (right).\nPost-resuscitation SpO2 was maintained above 94% and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was constantly above 80 mmHg without the need for inotropes or vasopressors. However, it was subsequently noted that the cerebral rSO2 had decreased to 33% (left) and 35% (right) and a repeat ABG showed resolution of the respiratory acidosis with pH 7.3, pCO2 33, pO2 138, HCO3 16, and SaO2 99%.\nVentilator settings were immediately adjusted and the minute ventilation reduced by lowering the ventilator rate to aim for mild therapeutic hypercapnia with a target pCO2 of 50\u201355 mmHg. PEEP was reduced from 12 cmH2O to avoid an excessively high intrathoracic pressure which may impede cerebral venous drainage. Patient was also started on dobutamine infusion to improve the global and cerebral perfusion as the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) of 62% reflected a systemic oxygen delivery/consumption mismatch, while a Pcv-aCO2 gap of 14 mmHg suggested a low-flow state. The above interventions resulted in an improvement in cerebral rSO2 to 55% (left) and 51% (right) ().\nPatient was cooled for 24 h and then gradually rewarmed. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe global hypokinesia with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 26%.\nHe was subsequently extubated after 6 days in the cardiac intensive care unit with improvement in Glasgow coma scale score and underwent rehabilitation in the general ward. On discharge, he had a cerebral performance category of 1 and is now on follow-up in the outpatient clinic. What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?",

    "question": "A 34-year-old male patient was admitted with complaints of cough and fever for 2 weeks. He had history of similar complaints in the past in the form of frequent episodes of cough with expectoration for which he was hospitalized and treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. He had no history of dyspnea, chest pain or pedal edema. General physical examination was unremarkable except for grade I clubbing. Clinical examination revealed blood pressure of 118/84 mm Hg in right upper limb in supine position with pulse rate of 96/min, regular, normal volume with a normal character with no radio-radial or radio-femoral delay and all peripheral pulses equally palpable. The jugular venous pressure was raised 2 cm above the angle of Louis with a prominent c-v pattern. The apical impulse was in the fifth intercostals space medial to the midclavicular line. The S1 was normal, and S2 was narrowly split with loud P2 component. There was pan-systolic murmur along the left lower sternal border radiating all over the precordium. On systemic examination, respiratory system showed barrel-shaped chest with anteroposterior and transverse diameter ratio of 1, widely spaced ribs and increased resonance to percussion, and breath sounds decreased in intensity symmetrically with prolonged expiration. Rest of the examination was normal. On investigations, total leukocytes were 14,200/mm3, polymorphs 72%, lymphocytes 22%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 2%, hemoglobin 15.1 g%, platelets 211,000/mm3, ESR 14 mm first h and fasting blood sugar was 98 mg%. Blood culture was negative for any growth. Sputum culture showed streptococcus pneumonia sensitive to amoxicillin, and patient was treated accordingly. On chest radiography, there were bronchiectatic changes. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with heart rate of 102 and right axis deviation. In lead II, III and aVF, P-wave was tall and peaked with maximum P-wave amplitude > 7 mm and larger than QRS complex in lead II (). P-wave axis was +82\u00b0. This was referred as Himalayan P-waves suggestive of right atrial enlargement. Precordial leads showed slow R-wave progression with right ventricular strain pattern (). The 2D transthoracic echocardiography revealed enlarged right atrium and right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary arterial hypertension and preserved ejection fraction. So these findings were consistent with sequelae of COPD. The findings of bronchiectasis were confirmed on HRCT chest as evident by cystic bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and mucous plugging (). The bronchial dilation was also seen, lack of bronchial tapering and visibility of airways within 1 cm of the pleural surface, i.e., abutting the mediastinal pleural surface ().

    "question": "A 50-year-old male who had a past medical history of HIV with unknown cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) lymphocyte count and not compliant with his medications was brought in by emergency medical services (EMS) after he was found in his room covered in feces and looking disheveled. They brought him to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center emergency room. His initial vital signs showed a temperature of 100 \u00baF, blood pressure of 143/91 mmHg, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute. He was noticed to have disseminated, vesicular-pustular rash all over his body at different stages of healing and crusted skin eruption on his anterior neck and submandibular area (Figures -).\nPatient\u2019s neurological exam revealed that he was alert and oriented to self only, had a right-sided upper and lower facial droop. The patient also had impaired hearing on the right side. The muscle strength was 5/5 throughout. The patient had normal reflexes and the sensation was intact. The remainder of his physical exam did not show any other abnormal findings. Computerized tomography of the head without contrast showed no acute intracranial pathology. Subsequently, the patient had a lumbar puncture done in the emergency room which revealed a cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a white blood cell count of 849 cells/uL with lymphocyte predominance (72%), glucose of 39 mg/dl and protein of 364 mg/dl. Serum electrolytes, liver enzymes, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. CSF sample was sent for a varicella-zoster polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test as well. His chest X-ray was clear without any infiltrates. His initial laboratory investigations are summarized in Table .\nA presumptive diagnosis of disseminated VZV with encephalitis was made according to the patient's skin lesions and CSF analysis. Therefore, he was started on intravenous acyclovir at 10 mg/kg every eight hours and admitted to the general medical floor under contact and airborne precautions. Patient\u2019s varicella zoster PCR from the CSF sample came back positive. Patient mental status improved rapidly within 48 hours of treatment and he became alert and fully oriented. On eye exam, the patient had diplopia with right gaze, and it was determined that he had a right sixth cranial nerve palsy. He had deficits in right sided cranial nerves VI, VII, and VIII evident by impaired right eye abduction, right sided facial weakness, as well as impaired hearing. This constellation of findings is likely secondary to Ramsay Hunt syndrome with multiple cranial nerve involvement. Intravenous acyclovir was continued, and the patient started taking prednisone 50 mg orally for five days for the treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. He was also found to have otitis externa and was prescribed ciprofloxacin with dexamethasone otic drops. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain without contrast found nonspecific white matter lesions in the high left frontal lobe measuring approximately 8 mm but otherwise no mass, hemorrhage, or acute infarct (Figure ).\nThe patient\u2019s mental status came back to his baseline on day three. The patient\u2019s rash had crusted on day six hence the isolation precautions were discontinued. He started ambulating without any difficulty and facial paralysis resolved by day eight. He was safely discharged home after nine days of hospital stay with oral acyclovir 400 mg tablets three times daily for 21 days and prednisone 50 mg tablets daily for three days.

Positive history included recurrent cough for the past 1 year and low-grade fever for 3 months. No history of dysphagia, jaundice, abdominal distension, pain abdomen or altered sensorium. No history of chronic medications (oral anticoagulants or anti-platelets), analgesic intake or any substance abuse. She had received four units of packed red cells at an outside facility prior to admission. She was conscious, oriented, hemodynamically labile (heart rate: 110/min; BP: 86/60 mm Hg) with mild fever (99\u00b0F). General survey revealed obvious pallor. All other system examinations were within acceptable limits. Her hemoglobin (Hb) was 7.3 gram%, total leukocyte count (TLC) was 6400 cells/mm3, total bilirubin was 1.31 mg/dl and total protein was 4.75 gram%. An urgent UGI endoscopy revealed an opening in the posterior wall of the lower third of the esophagus, with a diverticulum. Inflammatory changes were noted in the diverticulum (). Contrast-enhanced computed tomogram (CECT) revealed erosion of the pouch into the thoracic aorta (), and a diagnosis of AEF with acute UGI hemorrhage was made.\nThe patient was resuscitated with packed red cells and definitive surgical management was emergently undertaken. A left posterolateral thoracotomy was performed, and pus was found in the pleural cavity and posterior mediastinum. After debridement of the chest cavity, partial bypass was instituted by cannulating the aortic arch in between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery, and connecting this via the cardiopulmonary bypass machine to another cannula in the descending thoracic aorta just above the diaphragm (). The aorta was cross-clamped above and below the suspected fistulous region and opened longitudinally. A 2 \u00d7 2 cm opening was seen in the wall of the aorta, adjoining the esophagus (), and this was internally repaired with a Dacron patch (), and the aorta was primarily closed. The esophageal opening was debrided and then repaired with interrupted polypropylene sutures, superimposed with a vascularized intercostal muscle pedicle (). Bypass was successfully discontinued and a gastrostomy and jejunostomy were created. She remained on broad-spectrum antibiotics and the rest of her postoperative course was uneventful.

    "question": "A 44-year-old gravida 6 para 4 postpartum woman presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of substernal chest pain. That afternoon, she experienced sudden-onset severe left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and shoulder. She had been discharged four days prior after induction of labor for chronic hypertension with an uncomplicated vaginal birth. Her medical history was notable only for hypertension, for which she took metoprolol. She was maintained on metoprolol with good blood pressure control for the duration of her pregnancy and after induction. The day prior to admission she was under significant emotional distress after her infant was hospitalized with hyperbilirubinemia.\nIn the ED, the patient was afebrile, her blood pressure was 164/101 mm Hg, her heart rate was 60 beats per minute, and she was breathing 16 breaths per minute. Her cardiovascular examination was unremarkable with normal heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops and no jugular venous distension. Her lungs were clear, her abdomen was soft, and she had no extremity edema. Her complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel results were within normal limits. Her initial troponin I was 0.41 ng/mL (reference range, <0.04 ng/mL), and her electrocardiogram (ECG) () was significant for ST elevation in leads V2-V5 consistent with an anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Her chest X-ray showed normal mediastinum, no signs of cardiomegaly, and clear lungs.\nGiven the concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the patient was emergently taken to the cardiac catheterization lab. Her coronary angiogram showed haziness of the midleft anterior descending (LAD) artery followed by an abrupt change in arterial caliber extending to the distal LAD and diagonal branches (). There was no clear visualization of a dissection flap, but there was a visible long segment of diffuse vessel narrowing in the mid to distal LAD highly suspicious for coronary dissection. Contrast flow in the distal vessel was normal (TIMI 3), and there were no luminal changes with the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin. There was no angiographic evidence of atherosclerotic disease in any of her coronary arteries, and no evidence of narrowing in the coronary arteries outside of the LAD. Her chest pain was resolved during the procedure, and her ECG showed normalization of her ST elevation. Given the patient's hemodynamic stability, normal blood flow in the distal LAD, resolution of chest pain, and suspicion for dissection, she was managed conservatively.\nShe was started on IV nitroglycerin for hypertension, metoprolol, and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and then transferred to the coronary care unit for close observation. Her transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 68% and hypokinetic septal and apical walls in the distribution of the LAD. Her repeat ECG () showed the expected evolution of her STEMI with QS waves and T-wave inversions seen in leads V2-V5. She was weaned off the nitroglycerin and transitioned to captopril and nifedipine for strict blood pressure control and safety with breastfeeding.\nShe remained chest-pain free during the course of the hospitalization and underwent a repeat angiogram to evaluate for the progression of disease given the diagnostic uncertainty. Her repeat angiogram on day 6 of hospitalization showed complete resolution of the LAD lesion () consistent with dissection. Compared to the initial angiogram, the area of haziness was no longer present, and the vessel tapered appropriately towards the apical LAD. However, a new tubular narrowing with abrupt vessel caliber change () was noted in the midposterior descending artery (PDA), compared to her initial angiogram () with normal flow and no clear dissection flap. This event was concerning for a new dissection event. The patient was asymptomatic throughout her hospitalization and was discharged home with close obstetric, primary care, and cardiology outpatient follow-up.

    "question": "A 45-year-old man, who was diagnosed with gastric SET detected on endoscopy during a routine medical examination, was referred to our hospital in August 2016 for further evaluation. He was symptom-free and presented no specific abdominal symptoms such as pain, vomiting, heartburn, dysphagia, or change in bowel habits. He had no history of medication or family history of malignant disease or autoimmune disorder.\nIn the physical examination, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg and heart rate was 80 bpm. The abdomen was soft and flat, and no palpable mass was observed. His laboratory results were normal for the following parameters: leucocyte count, 8900/mm3; hemoglobin level, 14.3 g/dL; and platelet count, 226,000/mm3. His liver function tests were normal. Serum IgG4 or other immunoglobulin levels were not measured because there was no reason to suspect IgG4-RD at that time.\nEndoscopy with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed. In endoscopic vision, a 3 \u00d7 3 cm fixed, round, hard mucosal lesion was detected on the greater curvature of the upper gastric body (Fig. ). Endoscopic biopsy showed only mild chronic gastritis. EUS revealed a mainly hypoechoic, oval with sharp margins intramural lesion developing from the muscularis propria and measuring 29.4 \u00d7 16.4 mm at its largest diameter (Fig. ). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a well-defined heterogeneously enhancing wall mass at the greater curvature of the upper gastric body (Fig. ), most likely to be a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). No lymphadenopathy was noted.\nLaparoscopic wedge resection was performed using Endo GIATM iDrive purple 60 mm (Covedien, New Haven, CT, USA). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day.\nHistopathological examination of the lesion revealed a tan whitish-colored firm mass, measuring 3 \u00d7 2.8 cm, protruding from the submucosa and subserosa. On cut section, it appeared white-gray in color (Fig. ). Microscopically, storiform dense fibrosis and dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of plasma cells were identified by hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. A and B). On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor stained negative for anti c-kit protein and SMA; thus, GIST could be ruled out. Besides, we found IgG and IgG4-positive plasma cells in a ratio of IgG4/total IgG 40%, and a number of IgG4-positive plasma cells at approximately 60/high powered field (HPF), which indicated that the lesion could be an IgG4-related inflammatory mass (Fig. C and D).\nThe patient is presently followed up annually in our clinic. In April 2019, the latest follow-up date, the patient did not have any problems and showed no signs of recurrence on endoscopy and abdominal CT examination.

    "question": "A 66-year-old white female with a 50 pack-year smoking history presented to our tertiary hospital with acute massive haemoptysis. She had recently moved interstate, with no patient data available in our hospital system. The patient also reported anorexia and weight loss of approximately 3 kg in the past 6 months. On examination, she was afebrile, pulse rate was 90 beats min\u20131, respiratory rate was mildly increased at 22 breaths min\u20131 and blood pressure was slightly elevated at 150/90 mmHg. On auscultation of the chest, fine rales over the right lung base were noted. Laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count at 7300 cells l\u20131 (3.5\u201311 \u00d7 109 cells l\u20131), C-reactive protein 14 mg l\u20131 (< 5 mg l\u20131) and haemoglobin 100 g l\u20131 (110\u2013165 g l\u20131). Her initial chest X-ray showed an opacity in the right lower lobe (RLL) contiguous with the right hemidiaphragm (). A CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated a 2.8 cm solid enhancing nodule in the posterobasal segment of the RLL with a density measuring 35 HU, with a 7 mm central focus of dense calcification (); also noted were hyperdense endobronchial material in the RLL, which was thought to represent fresh blood. A suspicion of lung cancer was raised, especially in view of heavy smoking history and reported weight loss. Positron emission tomography revealed increased 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 5] within the RLL nodule; the report described the finding as concerning for malignancy, with the differential diagnosis of an inflammatory pseudotumour (). A subsequent bronchoscopy was complicated owing to active bleeding from the RLL bronchus. The transbronchial biopsy showed no malignant cells, acid-fast bacilli or fungi.\nUpon targeted questioning, the patient disclosed having had a complicated cholecystectomy 3 years ago, performed at another hospital, with attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy converted into an open laparotomy owing to gallbladder rupture with intraperitoneal spillage of gallstones; this was complicated by the formation of post-operative subphrenic abscess, which was surgically drained. The relevant externally performed images have been retrieved, including a CT scan of the abdomen (). The patient further admitted to occasional episodes of minor haemoptysis of about two spoonfuls over the past 2 years, associated with right-sided mild chest pain, which she did not seek medical attention for.\nAs the RLL mass was the presumed cause for the repeated episodes of haemoptysis, a thoracotomy was recommended and the patient underwent a RLL wedge resection. A firm rhomboid-shaped calculus measuring 11 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 8 mm () that dislodged from the specimen was confirmed to be a gallstone. Pathological examination additionally found abundant bile pigment (25%) surrounded by microorganisms, extensive interstitial fibrosis and hyalinization. Further biochemical analysis of the calculus revealed the presence of 85% cholesterol. Post-operative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital in a satisfactory condition 1 week after the surgery.

    "question": "This patient was a 35-year-old Hispanic female with no past medical history who presented to the emergency department primarily for evaluation of heavy vaginal bleeding, bruises on her skin, and fatigue. Vaginal bleeding had started three days prior to presenting to the hospital. The patient had initially thought that she may be pregnant because the onset of her cycle was late by approximately 15 days. The bleeding improved prior to presenting to the hospital but was still much heavier than her usual periods. At the time of heaviest bleeding, the patient reported changing pads every few hours and occasionally passing clots the size of a quarter. Associated symptoms included fatigue, weakness/malaise, abdominal pain, dizziness, and easy bruising. Review of systems was otherwise negative.\nFurther evaluation revealed that she did not have any bleeding disorders, abortions, or previously late/missed periods in the past. As for obstetric history, the patient had two prior pregnancies that had both gone to full term with vaginal delivery. Family history was also unremarkable for any hereditary bleeding disorders, cancers, or other pertinent medical diagnoses. The patient was not taking any medications at time of hospitalization. Surgical history was unremarkable. Regarding social history, she reported cigarette smoking in the past but had quit for several years, occasional alcohol use, and no current or past illicit drug use. Lastly, the patient had been isolating at home with her partner and their two children.\nPhysical examination at time of presentation revealed the following vital signs: temperature 36.5 Celsius, pulse of 60, respiratory rate 16, pulse oximetry 100% on ambient air, and blood pressure of 110/66. She remained afebrile and never required supplemental oxygen. In general, the patient appeared tired but was not lethargic or somnolent.

    "question": "A 48-year-old white male presented to the clozapine clinic for routine follow-up and monitoring. The past medical history was significant for schizoaffective disorder; tobacco use disorder; constipation; vitamin D deficiency; and metabolic syndrome characterized by obesity, dyslipidemia, and prediabetes. Current medications included clozapine 150 mg by mouth at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily, docusate 100 mg by mouth twice daily, and cholecalciferol 2000 units by mouth daily. He tried and failed multiple antipsychotics prior to initiation of clozapine 4 years ago. His mental health had been stable since initiating clozapine, and he resides in a group home. He gained 9.5 kg the year after clozapine was initiated, and then weight stabilized. He had difficulty controlling his diet at the group home and ate what was prepared for him. Despite lifestyle education, he continued to visit the vending machine frequently for soda (2 cans per day), candy bars (1 per day), and chips (1 bag per day). He was referred to a dietitian but was unable to successfully implement dietary changes. He did not have access to exercise equipment at his group home and did not walk outside due to inclement weather. He was referred to an exercise program located in the same facility as the clozapine clinic but did not attend the appointments. Metformin initiation for weight management and prediabetes was recommended at several appointments, but he declined because he preferred not to take more medications. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day and was not interested in smoking cessation services.\nHis resting BP was elevated at his past 2 appointments (136/84 and 136/86 mm Hg), so the nurse at his group home had been recording daily BP readings in a log. His BP log revealed an average BP of 138/86 mm Hg. Pertinent vital signs and fasting laboratory results from the appointment were as follows: height: 5 feet, 10 inches; weight: 104.5 kg; BMI: 33 kg/m2; BP: 138/88 mm Hg; pulse: 79 bpm; hemoglobin A1c = 6%; TC = 225 mg/dL; LDL = 136 mg/dL; triglycerides = 395 mg/dL; HDL = 27 mg/dL; clozapine level = 132 mcg/L; norclozapine level = 135 mcg/L; white blood cell count = 8.4 thousand cells/mcl; and absolute neutrophil count = 5.1 thousand cells/mcl.\nClozapine is considered high risk for causing increases in weight, lipids, BG, and BP. This patient had already tried and failed multiple antipsychotics, and his mental health had been stable for 4 years on clozapine. Switching to an antipsychotic with lower liability for metabolic AEs is likely not a feasible option for this patient. Lifestyle interventions are a first-line treatment approach, but the patient had been unsuccessful with altering his diet, exercising, or attempting smoking cessation. Therefore, medically treating the metabolic AEs was necessary.\nHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are considered the cornerstone of treatment for lipid lowering due to evidence demonstrating they can prevent ASCVD. There are 4 categories of patients that may benefit from statin therapy, including those with clinical ASCVD, LDL \u2265190 mg/dL, diabetes aged 40 to 75 years, and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk score \u22657.5%. An online ASCVD risk estimator can be located at . Individuals with an ASCVD risk score of 7.5% to <20% are considered intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event, and a moderate-intensity statin can be initiated if risk enhancers favor it. Examples of risk-enhancing factors include but are not limited to metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disease (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, HIV), ethnicity (eg, South Asian ancestry), and persistently elevated triglycerides (\u2265175 mg/dL). Individuals with an ASCVD risk score \u226520% are considered high risk, and statin initiation should be considered with a goal to reduce LDL by at least 50%. Moderate-intensity statins are expected to lower the LDL by 30% to 49% and high-intensity statins by \u226550% ().\nStatins are most effective for lowering LDL, but they can also lower triglycerides (22% to 45%) and increase HDL (5% to 10%). Fibrates and niacin are effective for reducing triglycerides but have a mild LDL-lowering effect, and there is not enough evidence to routinely support their use as add-on medications to a statin. Adding a fibrate or omega-3 fatty acids to a statin is recommended for patients with persistently elevated severe hypertriglyceridemia (\u2265500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis. Fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil in patients being treated with a statin due to lower risk of myopathy. The dose of the statin is another important consideration. The largest percentage of LDL lowering is achieved with the initial dose., Each doubling of the statin dose should then lead to an additional 4% to 7% reduction in LDL., Clinical experience indicates that starting statins at a low dose and titrating up does not lead to the same level of LDL lowering as starting at a moderate- to high-intensity dose. Initiation of a lower intensity statin may be considered if there is a history of statin intolerance.\nStage 1 hypertension is defined as systolic BP 130 to 139 or diastolic BP 80 to 89 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension is defined as BP \u2265140/90 mm Hg. At least 2 resting BP readings obtained on 2 separate occasions should be used to estimate the BP. A log of home BP readings can provide a more accurate estimation of BP if proper techniques are used. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults, nonpharmacologic therapy and treatment with an antihypertensive is recommended for individuals with stage 2 hypertension or stage 1 hypertension and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or higher. Initiation of 2 antihypertensive agents from different classes is recommended for individuals with stage 2 hypertension. A BP target of <130/80 mm Hg is recommended. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are first-line treatments for hypertension due to evidence demonstrating that they reduce clinical events. There is inadequate evidence to support beta blockers as a first-line treatment for hypertension in the absence of certain cardiovascular comorbidities, such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease. Patient-specific factors, such as comorbidities, concurrent medications, age, race, and medication adherence, should be taken into consideration when selecting an initial antihypertensive.\nThe optimal treatment for hypertension in individuals with metabolic syndrome has not been clearly defined. Thiazide diuretics can increase insulin resistance and accelerate conversion to diabetes mellitus.,, They can also worsen dyslipidemia., The European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension guidelines list metabolic syndrome as a possible contraindication for use of thiazide diuretics. The ACC/AHA guidelines note that small increases in BG levels are possible but also state there are no data available demonstrating deterioration in cardiovascular outcomes in patients with metabolic syndrome who are treated with thiazide diuretics. When no compelling indications or contraindications are present to help guide treatment selection, preference may be given to an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB in patients with metabolic syndrome to help avoid increases in BG. Age and race can also help with treatment selection. Thiazide diuretics and CCBs are preferred in Black adults without heart failure or chronic kidney disease because they are more effective than ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Older adults may also respond better to thiazide diuretics and CCBs due to a declining number of nephrons and lower plasma renin levels.\nUsing an average BP of 138/86 mm Hg, the patient in this case had a 10-year ASCVD risk score of approximately 17.5%, placing him into a statin benefit group. His known risk-enhancing factors included metabolic syndrome, characterized by persistently elevated triglycerides, obesity, and elevated BP. He also smoked cigarettes. Lifestyle modifications continued to be encouraged, and a risk-benefit discussion about statin therapy was conducted. He was willing to initiate a statin and was started on atorvastatin 20 mg by mouth daily. A moderate-intensity statin was appropriate based on his 10-year ASCVD risk score. His triglycerides were elevated but not enough to warrant addition of a nonstatin therapy. His BP readings in the clinic and at home indicated he had stage 1 hypertension, and his 10-year ASCVD risk score was greater than 10%. The patient did not have any compelling indications or contraindications to help guide selection of an antihypertensive. Given his age, race, and history of metabolic syndrome, initiation of an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB may be most appropriate. After review of the potential AEs associated with each medication class, the patient elected to start amlodipine 5 mg by mouth daily.

    "question": "A 79-year-old woman with stage IV colon cancer, metastatic to the lungs and the adrenal glands, presented to the emergency department with dry cough and worsening dyspnea on exertion of 1-day duration. She was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2015 and underwent left-sided colectomy and then was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil [5-FU] for a total of 6 cycles). In 2018, she developed left lower extremity edema and was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis of the left femoral vein and left great saphenous vein and was placed on rivaroxaban. Extensive workup showed metastatic disease to the lungs, adrenal glands, and pelvic lymph nodes. Biopsy of one of the nodes confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon. She was started on the combination of capecitabine 1000 mg twice a day (day 1 to day 14 every 21 days) and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg (day 1 every 21 days) and received the first dose of bevacizumab 1 week after starting capecitabine; she has never been on those drugs before. Less than 24 hours after the bevacizumab dose, she started having a dyspnea on exertion that was worsening and was associated with a dry cough and fatigue.\nShe was tachycardic and tachypneic on admission (heart rate was 122 bpm, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min). Her blood pressure was 163/110 mm Hg. Her Sao2 was 84% on room air. She was placed on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for respiratory distress with minimal improvement on oxygen delivery therapies. Stat arterial blood gas showed acute hypoxic respiratory failure (pH of 7.26, Pco2 of 47, Po2 of 248, HCO3 of 21). She was subsequently intubated and required intensive care.\nHer admission blood work was significant for mild leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 13.42/\u03bcL, with 82% neutrophils) (see ). Chest radiograph showed bilateral basilar opacities (see ). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with intravenous contrast redemonstrated bilateral airspace opacities with a slight central distribution (see ).\nShe was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspicion of multifocal pneumonia. All cultures and gram stains for infectious etiologies including common bacteria, fungi, legionella, viruses, and Pneumocystis were negative. Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued when cultures came back negative; patient received antibiotics a total of 5 days. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed, and cytological examination of BAL fluid sample showed rare mildly atypical cells; it favored reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and bronchial cells in a background of marked acute inflammation. Cultures of BAL were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungal pathogens. Pneumocystis jiroveci was not detected by polymerase chain reaction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, a grade I diastolic dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. On day 6 of hospitalization, the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 60 mg given every 8 hours with the aim to treat presumed interstitial pneumonitis. Subsequently, the patient\u2019s condition improved significantly, and she was extubated within 2 days of corticosteroid therapy initiation. Post-extubation, bilevel positive airway pressure\u2013assisted ventilation was used as needed and she was subsequently transitioned to daily oral prednisone 40 mg. Arterial blood gas analysis on 3 L nasal cannula then showed a pH of 7.54, Pco2 of 38, Po2 of 159 and an oxygen saturation of 98%. Chest radiograph on discharge showed partial resolution of the bibasilar opacities (see ). Eventually, the patient was discharged after 3 weeks on therapeutic subcutaneous enoxaparin and long-term oxygen therapy as needed with a gradual taper of steroid. She eventually signed a Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate form and was put on hospice care. No further chemotherapy was administered.

His symptoms were associated with generalized myalgia, fatigue, diaphoresis, and non-bloody diarrhea. He denied sick contacts but was employed as a maintenance manager with a focus on air conditioner repair.\nTo note, he was originally diagnosed with osteoarthritis in the context of bilateral knee pain, associated swelling, and morning stiffness, however, was subsequently diagnosed with RA that was managed with chronic daily prednisone (30 mg) for three years before transitioning to adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) inhibitor. He received his first infusion one week prior to the hospital presentation.\nIn the ED the patient was afebrile, normotensive (132/82 mmHg), but markedly tachycardic (157 beats per minute), tachypneic (30 breaths per minute), and hypoxic to 72% on room air. There was a minimal improvement with nasal cannula and nonrebreather, and the patient was initiated on heated high flow nasal cannula (55 L; 100% FiO2) with improved saturation to 95%. Physical examination revealed an obese gentleman with cushingoid features (buffalo hump, abdominal striae) and bilateral lower limb pitting edema. Cardiac examination was unremarkable and pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Joints evaluation revealed mild bilateral knee swelling and effusions without additional joint deformities. Laboratory diagnostics demonstrated mild leukocytosis with a slight neutrophilic predominance, but no evidence of anemia or thrombocytopenia. The metabolic panel was notable for an elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine (baseline < 1), and transaminitis with elevated inflammatory markers (Table ). Urinalysis was unremarkable with the exception of microscopic hematuria. Nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and urinary legionella antigen were positive. Diagnostic imaging included a chest radiograph that demonstrated extensive consolidation throughout the left lung field with air bronchograms involving the upper lobe, lower lobe, lingula, and right upper lobe (Figure ). Chest CT was negative for pulmonary embolism but revealed complete opacification of the left lung fields with diffuse pneumonia and associated air bronchograms, trace pleural effusion, and multiple ground glass alveolar infiltrates involving the right upper, middle, and lower lobes (Figure ).\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of COVID-19 and Legionella pneumonia and initiated on dexamethasone (10 mg, daily; 10 days), remdesivir (daily; 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg, daily; 14 days), and ceftriaxone (1 g, daily, 7 days). It took 18 days to wean him to room air and prior to discharge, repeat COVID testing was negative. He was discharged on prednisone 30 mg daily for his RA and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Bactrim double strength, DS 800-160 mg) thrice weekly for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis.

    "question": "A 69-year-old man presented to the emergency room with two weeks of exertional dyspnea, unable to ambulate greater than 50 feet. Cardiopulmonary examination showed blood pressure of 131/82 mmHg, heart rate of 77 beats/min, a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse, bilateral dependent lung crackles, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Medical history included uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, peripheral artery disease, 50 pack-year smoking history, and alcohol use disorder. No history of recreational drug use was reported. Patient had no prior surgical history. The differential diagnosis for the etiology of clinical heart failure in this patient included ischemic cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\nOn admission, a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with QS waves in leads V2-V4. Laboratory studies showed troponin I of 0.04 ng/ml and brain natriuretic peptide of 2498 pg/ml. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%-35% with moderate to severe global hypokinesis. Given patient\u2019s high likelihood of coronary artery disease, he underwent coronary angiography for workup of his cardiomyopathy, which revealed a diffusely diseased left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with worst stenosis up to 70%-80% (Figure -).\nPatient was deemed not a candidate for coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) by cardiothoracic surgery; thus, PCI with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance was performed. The LAD lesion was crossed using a Choice PT wire (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA) and predilated using multiple compliant balloons with good expansion. A 3.0 x 28 mm drug-eluting stent (DES) was implanted in the distal LAD, 3.5 x 38 mm DES in the mid-LAD, and 3.5 x 28 mm DES in the proximal LAD with a very good final angiographic result (Figure ). The IVUS was used prior to stent implantation for lesion characterization and vessel sizing and post-stenting to confirm adequate stent expansion and apposition without any edge dissection. However, there was an occlusion of a septal perforating artery due to being jailed by the LAD stent struts (Figure ). We opted not to intervene on this septal branch to avoid disruption of LAD stent struts. Moreover, the patient did not have any clinical signs or symptoms from losing this septal branch. He did well and was subsequently discharged on appropriate medical therapy.\nSix-month post-PCI, TTE showed improved left ventricular ejection fraction to 55%, but thinning of the midanteroseptum and midinferoseptum was noted (Figure -). No ventricular septal perforation was detected after evaluating the defect on multiple views with color Doppler. What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?",

    "question": "A 44-year-old female presented with vaginal bleeding along with exertional chest discomfort. Vitals signs at the time of presentation were insignificant except for pulse 101 beats per minute with the normal electrocardiogram. However, she had no any past history of cardiovascular disease. Gynecological evaluations revealed cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, stage IVB) which instigated further investigations and evaluations. Whole body positron-emitting tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) () revealed right ventricular mass possibly malignancy or tumor thrombus with enlarged lymph node in left inguinal area and retroperitoneum without other distant metastasis. For further evaluation of tachycardia and dyspnea occurred a week before visiting the hospital, transthoracic echocardiography () and pro B-type natriuretic peptide measurement were performed. Pro B-type natriuretic peptide was within the normal range but transthoracic echocardiography revealed right ventricular mass doubtful of malignant mass or tumor thrombus. Hence, she was referred to Department of cardio-thoracic surgery for further evaluation and management. She underwent total bypass surgery and removal of the mass. Histopathology revealed the mass to be a metastatic lesion from the cervical squamous carcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient received 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel (Genexol, Samyang, Seoul, Korea) and 50 mg/m2 of cisplatin for 12 cycles with 3 weeks apart. Until 9th cycle of chemotherapy, there was no relapse of disease which was confirmed by abdomen CT. She then underwent additional 3 cycles of chemotherapy as laboratory test and serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen level (5.2 ng/mL, normal <12.5 ng/mL) reported normal. A contrast enhanced CT was done after additional 3 cycles which unfortunately showed suspicious of newly metastatic lesion in the bladder. She tolerated the chemotherapy well till the 7th cycle only when she started complaining dyspnea on mild exertion. However, echocardiography was normal. Two months after completing 12th cycle, she started to suffer from the dyspnea again. CT scan of chest was performed, which confirmed the increased extent of focal filling defect (thromboembolism) in right pulmonary artery. Echocardiography showed newly developed severe pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular dysfunction. She was then treated with the intravenous heparin because of which she developed severe per vaginal bleeding. Unfortunately, she died of pulmonary embolism fourteen months and 4 weeks from the diagnosis of cardiac metastasis. What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?",

    "question": "A 67-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 2-day history of pain and a feeling of coldness in her right hand. In her past medical history she had not received any treatment for dyslipidemia. There is no other medical history or smoking history. Upon physical examination she had no heart murmur or leg edema; her blood pressure was 154/96 mm Hg (left brachial), and oxygen saturation of peripheral artery was 96% at room air. Her right hand was pale and the right radial artery was pulseless. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 79 bpm. The serum D-dimer level was slightly increased (2.18 \u00b5g/mL). Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed thromboembolism in the distal part of the right brachial artery, left pulmonary artery and right kidney infraction (). Cerebral infraction and stenosis of the main cerebral artery were not detected by the head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).\nDoppler sonography of right upper limb revealed the disappearance of blood flow at the distal part of the brachial artery, and collateral circulation to the radial artery from the brachial artery. In this case, multiple thromboemboli occurred in both the systemic and pulmonary circulation. Thus, we suspected paradoxical thromboembolism. Transesophageal echocardiogram and venous ultrasonography findings showed the presence of a PFO and DVT (). Thus, we diagnosed paradoxical embolism due to PFO. Photoplethysmogram (PTG) of her right hand was very slow on admission (). The condition of her right upper limb had been relieved from 2 days previously due to the development of collateral circulation. Therefore, we thought that neither emergency operation nor catheter intervention for thrombectomy was necessary in this patient. We started treatment with urokinase (UK) 240,000 U/day intravenous injection (IV) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) continuous IV (target activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 60 - 80 s). As her condition and the serum D-dimer level were improving we started catheterization at day 7 after admission (); however the thrombus still remained in the brachial artery. Although her pain was relieved, her right hand was still cold and PTG of the right hand at day 7 was slow. For her outpatient care, based on the viewpoint of providing rapid anticoagulant therapy within the therapeutic range, having longest periods of initial intensive therapy we chose treatment using ribaroxaban (15 mg, two tablets twice daily) (). Three weeks after discharge from the hospital, her right hand had become warm and the serum D-dimer level and PTG were normalized (). From that time, we changed ribaroxaban to the maintenance dose (15mg, one tablet once daily). Three months after discharge, Doppler sonography and MRA of her right arm confirmed the achievement of reperfusion of her brachial artery ().

    "question": "A 56-years-old woman with history of hypertension, decompensated diabetes mellitus, was referred to our hospital with critical limb ischemia (CLI) presenting rest pain and ulcer on the left leg and negative COVID-19. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg with 130 b/m. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed a mesogastrium systolic bruit. Electrocardiogram showed signs of ST segment depression without thoracic pain. Coronary angiography was positive for severe coronary artery disease with no indication to treatment. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) revealed widespread irregularities of the aortic wall with monophasic wave on right common femoral artery and direct flow on the left femoral axis; diffuse disease of both superficial femoral arteries (SFA) with distal occlusion in the left side.\nCT-scan showed atherosclerotic disease on infrarenal abdominal aorta with focal dissection, occlusion of right common iliac artery origin and short dissection of the left common iliac artery origin not hemodynamically significative ().\nThe presence of ulcers in the left leg was the indication to address the left SFA throughout an antegrade percutaneous homolateral access with drug eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty in the proximal SFA (6.0 \u00d7 60 mm Luminor\u00ae; iVascular, Vascular S.L.U., Barcelona, Spain) and distal stenting (5.0x80mm iVolution; iVascular) (). The final result was a complete lesion healing in the left foot at three weeks ().\nAfter two months of the index procedure, the patient was readmitted due to gangrene of the right foot and asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. The control CT showed a similar vascular pattern on the right side with no significant difference with the previous CT. At this stage, the rapid and aggressive right foot lesions evolution was the indication to address vascular lesions in the right axis.\nThe intervention was carried under general anesthesia with surgical exposure of both common femoral arteries employed as remote accesses for multilevel endovascular intervention. The first step consisted of aorto-iliac repair (aortic dissection and right common iliac occlusion) using an AFX aortic endograft (Endoogix Inc., Irvine, CA, USA); stenting of the right common iliac artery (balloon expandable stent - Isthmus 10 \u00d7 39; CID SpA, Saluggia, Italy).\nDuring the same operation, the right SFA disease was addressed with a DEB (Luminor 5 \u00d7 200 iVascular) (). The multiple intervention determined the increase of the distal flow and the reappearance of dorsalis pedis pulse. After two days, the patient was asymptomatic for right foot pain and underwent to right foot minor amputation. The patient was discharged after a week with double antiplatelet therapy. CT angiography performed after two months confirmed the proper positioning of the aortic stent-graft with good patency of iliac-femoral axis and right foot ulcers healing ().

    "question": "A 77-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital because of fever of unknown origin. She had developed general fatigue and a slight fever 2 weeks before admission. Headache and a fever higher than 38\u00b0C had developed 3 days before admission, and oral cefditoren pivoxil prescribed at another hospital had been ineffective. She had a 2-year history of polymyalgia rheumatica and chronic gastritis. She had initially been treated with 15 mg/day of prednisolone for the polymyalgia rheumatica. Her dosage of prednisolone was tapered with improvement of her symptoms, and she had been treated with prednisolone (5 mg/day) and famotidine (20 mg/day) for 1 year before admission. She had no other medical or family history and did not smoke or drink alcohol. Physical examination on admission revealed a height of 156 cm, weight of 49 kg, temperature of 40.2\u00b0C, heart rate of 120 beats/min, and blood pressure of 116/62 mmHg. No obvious abnormalities of the chest or abdomen were found with the exception of slight right flank pain. Neurological examination also showed normal findings; her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was maximal at 15 (E4V5M6). She was ambulatory; no symptoms suggesting agnosia, agraphia, or any other higher brain dysfunction were observed on admission. In addition, finger perimetry showed no obvious visual field deficits. Laboratory findings showed a high WBC count (20,200/mm3), platelet count (40.4 \u00d7 104/mm3), and CRP level (10.02 mg/dl). Chest X-ray, abdominal X-ray, and electrocardiographic findings were normal. Urinalysis revealed pyuria with markedly increased WBCs and gram-negative bacilli, suggesting a urinary tract infection. Intravenous administration of ampicillin (6 g/day) was begun immediately after admission. On day 4, her body temperature remained higher than 38\u00b0C despite improvement in the WBC count (18,300/mm3) and CRP level (3.91 mg/dl). On the same day, E. coli was revealed in urine and blood culture specimens taken on admission. Although the E. coli was sensitive to ampicillin, we substituted ceftriaxone (2 g/day) for ampicillin on day 4 based on the results of the antibiotic sensitivity test.\nOn day 5, her body temperature dropped to 37.5\u00b0C. However, she began to drop her spoon frequently during meals and complain of difficulty in donning her shirt. On day 6, she complained of difficulty in seeing. Although she did not exhibit severe palsy or ataxia, she could no longer eat a meal, change her clothes, or walk by herself without nursing care. She was considerably confused, and it was difficult to evaluate her neurological function precisely. Her level of consciousness sharply deteriorated thereafter, and her GCS score dropped to 9 (E2V3M4). Her WBC count and CRP level on day 6 were 15,600/mm3 and 3.63 mg/dl, respectively. Electrolyte, thyroid hormone, and blood glucose levels were normal. Plain brain CT on day 6 showed debris in the right lateral ventricle and a tumor-like lesion in the left posterior lobe (Figure A). Contrast-enhanced MRI on day 6 revealed a tumor-like lesion in the left posterior lobe with ring-like enhancement on T1-weighted imaging (Figure B). On diffusion-weighted imaging, this lesion also showed homogenous high intensity, which seemed to be connected with the left lateral ventricle, and obvious debris was present in both lateral ventriculi (Figure C). Based on these findings, we considered that ventricular rupture of a brain abscess was the most probable cause of her deterioration. The size of the abscess was 1.6 \u00d7 1.8 cm. Subsequent abdominal contrast-enhanced CT on day 6 showed a unilocular right renal cyst with heterogeneous and high-density content, suggesting a renal cyst infection (Figure A). Abdominal ultrasonographic findings were inconclusive for a cyst infection. Contrast-enhanced chest CT showed no remarkable findings. Further laboratory and transthoracic echocardiographic diagnostics excluded potential risk factors for brain abscess, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, fungal infection, endocarditis, and pulmonary hypertension. We immediately consulted with neurosurgeons and decided to manage the right occipital lesion with intravenous meropenem administration (6 g/day). Her consciousness gradually improved thereafter; her GCS score recovered to 12 (E3V4M5) on day 9. She was slightly confused and showed impaired orientation, but her ability to converse with us had improved. Brain MRI on day 9 revealed no remarkable changes in the size of the abscess. No signs of high intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus were present either clinically or radiographically. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on day 9 revealed a slight increase in leukocytes (64/mm3), including 23/mm3 (36%) lymphocytes and 41/mm3 (64%) neutrophils with no atypical cells, as well as high total protein (517 mg/dl) and low glucose (21 mg/dl) levels. Microscopy of CSF smear samples with methylene blue staining, India ink capsule staining, and Gram\u2019s staining detected no bacteria or fungi. The CSF culture was sterile. On day 12, her body temperature remained below 37.5\u00b0C, but her WBC count (14,900/mm3) and CRP level (4.01 mg/dl) remained high. Additionally, her right flank pain persisted despite antibiotic therapy. MRI on day 12 showed no deterioration of the brain abscess. Based on these findings, we concluded that CT-guided drainage was needed to manage the renal cyst infection. The drainage procedure was performed on day 13, and E. coli from the aspirated pus showed the same sensitivity to antibiotics as did the E. coli from the blood and urine on admission. The patient showed good progress thereafter. The drainage catheter was removed on day 20. Her GCS score recovered to 15 on day 22. On day 30, she showed almost normal activities of daily life, although she still experienced difficulty in seeing. Her WBC count and CRP level normalized, and enhanced brain MRI showed a dramatic decrease in the abscess size (Figure D). Moreover, abdominal enhanced CT on day 35 showed that the right renal cyst had decreased in size (Figure B). Formal perimetry was performed by an ophthalmologist on day 35 and showed obvious right inferior quadrantic hemianopsia. Moreover, transesophageal echocardiography using contrast medium on day 35 showed no cryptic abnormalities, including intracardiac right-to-left shunting or small vegetations. Intravenous administration of meropenem was terminated on day 42, and no deterioration was observed even in the absence of oral antibiotics. Following rehabilitation, she was discharged from the hospital on day 60 with right inferior quadrantic hemianopsia as an aftereffect. She has been followed up for 6 months since discharge, and no recurrence of the brain abscess or renal cyst infection has been observed.

    "question": "An 86-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and hypertension presented to the emergency department due to altered mental status. She was lethargic, confused, and was not answering questions appropriately for the past four days. On arrival, she was afebrile, and her vitals included a pulse of 139 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/79 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with saturation of 96% on room air. Physical exam was significant for a slow to respond female, orientated to self, who was able to follow commands with no focal neurological deficit. Her skin was warm and well-perfused with normal capillary refill, with no rashes or petechiae. The cardiovascular exam was significant for tachycardia, an irregular heart rhythm, and a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. She had lower extremity pitting edema bilaterally. Her lab results were notable for elevated white blood cell count (WBC) 25.2 x 103 \u03bcL (3.9-11.3 x 103 \u03bcL), hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (11.3-15.1 g/dL), platelets 58.0 x 103 \u03bcL (165-366 x 103 \u03bcL), troponin 0.164 ng/mL (<0.010 ng/mL), lactic acid 2.5 mmol/L (0.5-2.0 mmol/L), and a basic chemistry panel was within normal limits. The urinalysis was remarkable for the presence of WBCs, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria with a urine culture pending. Additionally, two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Her electrocardiogram was significant for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR). She was started on ceftriaxone for probable UTI and was admitted to the hospital for further management. Further diagnostics included lower extremity Doppler ultrasound, which revealed deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A bedside echocardiogram indicated right ventricular strain, and the N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 8,215 pg/mL (<449 pg/mL). Due to concern for possible pulmonary embolism in the setting of known DVT, the patient was started on a continuous heparin infusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe aortic valve calcification with new aortic insufficiency. Blood and urine cultures returned positive for Aerococcus urinae. A transesophageal echocardiogram further confirmed moderate to severe aortic regurgitation with findings suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE), see Figures , .\nAntibiotics were expanded to include gentamicin with ceftriaxone for IE, and surgical evaluation was consulted. Given she was a high-risk surgical candidate, surgery intervention was not offered at this time unless evidence of further clinical decompensation. Additional surgical recommendations included re-evaluation after completion of antibiotic course. She was therefore discharged on intravenous antibiotics to complete a total of six weeks of treatment with ceftriaxone and two weeks of gentamicin. Soon after completion, the patient returned due to worsening thrombocytopenia that had previously improved upon discharge. On readmission, repeat labs were most notable for worsening thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia. The patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR and physical exam concerning for decompensated heart failure. Despite administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and heart rate control, the patient continued to decline, and her clinical picture was consistent with cardiogenic shock. In addition to respiratory distress, the patient went into ventricular fibrillation arrest. Due to the patient's wishes to not be intubated or resuscitated, she was made comfortable and passed away.

    "question": "A 68-year-old male patient 17 years after heart transplant was referred to our outpatient clinic for a regular follow-up. The patient was transplanted by biatrial method due to end-stage heart failure following a viral infection in July 1997. The Donor was a 37-year-old male without known risk factors. Postoperative course was uneventful under immunosuppression therapy with cyclosporin with no rejection episodes. The patient's post-HTx history included well controlled hypertension, mild chronic kidney disease, and prostatic hypertrophy.\nPhysical examination revealed good overall clinical condition, with normal blood pressure of 140/90 and a regular heart rate of 85/min. Standard laboratory findings were within reference ranges except for creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and GFR of 45 mL/min. Standard ECG demonstrated a regular sinus rhythm of 85 bpm, QRS duration within normal range and no ST segment deviation or T-wave abnormalities. Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function with EF of 60% and mild left ventricular hypertrophy of the graft that was noted during follow-up. Coronary angiography (2 years prior) showed normal coronary arteries without features of graft vasculopathy. Last myocardial biopsy performed in 2013 showed no signs of cellular rejection (ACR Grade 0 R). Standard graded cycle ergometry exercise test limited by exhaustion was performed (target HR was not used). Resting heart rate (82 beats/min) and BP values (140/84 mmHg), slowly increased up to 100 beats/min and 185/90 mmHg, respectively over 7 min. Maximal workload achieved was 75 W. During recovery phase a delayed HR recovery was noted, with HR gradually returning to its baseline value over 9 min. What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?",

    "question": "A 36-year-old Caucasian female attended the accident and emergency department with right-sided chest pain. The pain was described as dull and aching, with a pleuritic nature. It was sited diffusely over the right anterior and lateral chest wall and was reproducible on palpation. The pain had increased in severity over the preceding 6 weeks and at the time of admission was associated with mild dyspnea. Prior to presentation, the patient reported no weight loss, fevers or night sweats. Her family history and past medical history were unremarkable. However, she was a cigarette smoker (10 pack-year history).\nOn examination, the patient was pale and tachypnoeic. Her observations demonstrated a borderline tachycardia at 92 beats per minute and pulse oximetry of 92% on room air. On examination of the respiratory system, there was decreased expansion, dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right hemithorax. There was no jaundice, digital clubbing, skin changes or palpable lymphadenopathy. The breast examination was unremarkable.\nInitial laboratory findings demonstrated a leukocytosis (white blood cells 18.6 \u00d7 109/L) and neutrophilia (neutrophils 15.9 \u00d7 109/L), anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), thrombocytosis (platelets 518 \u00d7 109/L), hypercalcemia (corrected calcium 2.81 mmol/L), and raised C-reactive protein (117 mg/L).\nA chest radiograph revealed complete opacification of the right hemithorax with mild mediastinal shift to the left side (). This was further characterized by a contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis which showed a large loculated right pleural effusion with associated right lung collapse, significant multifocal right-sided pleural thickening, and multiple pulmonary nodules on the left. No abnormalities were seen below the diaphragm, save for some simple renal cysts. Appearances were reported to be likely in keeping with pleural and pulmonary metastases ().\nThe patient went on to have an ultrasound guided Seldinger chest drain inserted. Seven hundred twenty milliliters of heavily blood stained pleural fluid drained and was sent for analysis: pH 6.99, protein 52 g/L, and LDH 642 IU/L. Cytological analysis did not detect any malignant cells. The microscopy and subsequent culturing was unremarkable.\nConsidering the patient\u2019s young age and the radiological findings, our provisional diagnosis was malignancy with a likely primary of breast, ovary, lymphoma or lung. With this in mind our patient went on to have an ultrasound examination of her breasts, which revealed some areas of benign breast changes but no focal suspicious appearances. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated an anteverted uterus, endometrial thickness of 5 mm and normal ovaries.\nDespite chest drain insertion and the initial volume drained, we were subsequently unable to remove a significant volume of pleural fluid from the right hemi-thorax. The patient was referred to a tertiary center with cardiothoracic facilities where video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed. This allowed successful evacuation of the septated pleural effusion and the opportunity to perform pleural biopsies.\nThe histological diagnosis was confirmed by both conventional examination demonstrating the characteristic tumor cells with cords and nests, and immunohistochemistry with expression of MNF116 and CK7, D2-40, CD31 and CD34 antibodies ().\nPost-operatively our patient recovered well and was referred for specialist oncological input which she received at a quaternary London cancer center. Although an effective treatment for pleural PHE has yet to be established, Pinet et al [] have reported the case of an aggressive pleural PHE which had a complete response to treatment with carboplatin and etoposide. Our patient received weekly cycles of paclitaxel, a mitotic inhibitor, which has also demonstrated a clinical response in case reports [], for a 3-month period. Unfortunately, during this time she required frequent admissions for pain control and sadly passed away 6 months after her diagnosis.

He was reported by the paramedics to be hypotensive and tachycardic prior to arrival. His past medical history was significant for hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and gouty arthritis. On presentation to the emergency department, the patient appeared critically ill with generalized pallor, perioral cyanosis, with a heart rate of 133 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 130/106 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 15 L O2 via a nonrebreather mask. His exam was significant for grunting, otherwise clear bilateral breath sounds, rapid but regular heart tones, weak femoral pulses, and symmetric, non-edematous lower extremities.\nShortly after arrival, a bedside ultrasound was performed, demonstrating a thrombus in the right ventricle (RV) and inferior vena cava (IVC) (Figures and ). The patient lost cardiac motion during the ultrasound, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated with return of spontaneous circulation within one minute. He was emergently intubated, and his postintubation oxygen saturation was noted to be 60%, despite 100% FiO2 and confirmation of adequate tube placement. A repeat bedside ultrasound was performed with visualization of an enlarged right ventricle (), and an EKG demonstrated a new right bundle branch block (), highly suspicious for a massive pulmonary embolus. Shortly thereafter, the patient again lost pulses requiring CPR and 1 mg IV epinephrine, with subsequent return of spontaneous circulation in three minutes. The patient's blood pressure was maintained on a continuous infusion of epinephrine, and bolus dosing of alteplase (tPA) was being prepared while a CT angiogram (CTA) of the thorax was ordered. The CTA confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral massive pulmonary emboli (PE) (), and alteplase was administered at a bolus dose of 0.6 mg/kg over 2 minutes followed by a heparin infusion and admitted to the ICU without further hemodynamic decompensation.\nThe patient's course was complicated by bilateral pneumothoraces, acute renal failure, and subconjunctival hemorrhage. However, he was ultimately extubated and discharged home with full neurologic recovery, and a repeat CTA chest demonstrated resolution of pulmonary thrombi (). A deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the left distal popliteal vein with an aneurismal dilation of the popliteal vein was diagnosed during his inpatient stay, thought to be related a recent flare of gouty arthritis.

    "question": "A 49-year-old male patient without any significant past medical history presented to our hospital with problems of not voiding his bladder and back pain. The patient reported his back pain began four days ago when he was at work and tried to lift a 100 lb instrument. The patient went to see a chiropractor, but there was no improvement with his back pain. He then started to experience left thigh and buttock pain along with the back pain for which he took eight ibuprofen tablets a day (1600 mg) for four days before presenting to the hospital. He denies taking ibuprofen for any other pain that he experienced in the past.\nWhile in the emergency room, the initial labs revealed creatinine of 32mg/dL, BUN of 175mg/dL, Na of 128 mEq/L, K of 4.5mmol/L, Cl of 90mEq/L, Co2 of 17.0mEq/L, anion gap of 21, Ca of 7.9mEq/L, and a total creatine kinase of 1315 micromoles/L. His liver function tests (LFTs) were also elevated - serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 104 units, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 281 units. His urinalysis showed 3+ blood and 2+ protein but 0-5 red blood cells. Left lower extremity Doppler ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. There was fatty infiltration of the liver and thickening of the bladder wall, and diffuse soft tissue edema involving the left hip. The patient was given ondansetron hydrochloride (Zofran\u00ae Injection) 4 mg intravenously (IV) Q6H PRN for nausea, oxycodone hydrochloride (Roxicodone\u00ae) 5 mg PO Q4H PRN for pain, morphine sulfate 2 mg IV Q2H PRN for severe back pain, hydralazine hydrochloride (Apresoline\u00ae Injection) 10 mg IV Q4H PRN for hypertension, ceftriaxone sodium 1 gm/ (sodium chloride) 100 mls at 200 mls/hr IV Q24H at 1900 SCH for cystitis, and sodium bicarbonate 150 meq/ (dextrose) 1,150 mls at 150 mls/hr IV, Q7H40M SCH. Acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis was the impression on evaluation in the ED.\nLater the patient was moved to the telemetry unit to be followed up with the hospitalist. The patient was monitored by an internist, and a nephrology consultation was requested. On the following day, during the nephrology consultation, the patient's laboratory values were as shown in Tables -. The patient's vitals are mentioned in Table . CT scan and renal ultrasound of the kidneys were ordered. CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. The nephrologist's recommendation was to continue the patient on the IV fluids with bicarbonate and avoid nephrotoxins. The nephrologist closely monitored the patient, and the plan was to place the patient on temporary dialysis if the kidney function doesn't show improvement.\nOn a subsequent day on follow up with the internist, the kidney function tests were not improving; upon discussion with the nephrologist, a temporary dialysis catheter order was placed. On the same day, an interventional radiologist placed a right internal jugular vein (IJV) temporary dialysis catheter, and the patient went for the first round of hemodialysis treatment, after which the creatinine level went down to 18 mg/dl. Urinalysis was positive for protein and red blood cells, and the labs of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 1315 micromoles/L pointed towards rhabdomyolysis. The next day during the nephrology consultation, it was recommended to go for the second round of hemodialysis. The patient's lab showed phosphorus of 11.60 mg/dL, leading to sevelamer 800 mg PO TID initiation. The patient underwent another four rounds of hemodialysis, and the kidney function tests showed a creatinine level of 11.92 mg/dL.\nThe patient subsequently went through hemodialysis for the seventh time, but his kidney function had not yet returned to the normal level. The nephrologist ordered a tunneled dialysis catheter to be placed on the patient to be able to receive outpatient dialysis once he is discharged, which was also placed by an interventional radiologist. His labs were checked again, and the results showed that his CPK, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia were resolving to normal, but the creatinine stayed stable at a high level of 10.6 mg/dL. Due to the lack of improvement in the kidney function tests towards normal range, the nephrologist ordered a renal biopsy. A day later, a kidney biopsy was done (Figure ), which showed acute interstitial nephritis with very minimal chronicity, and the patient was started on prednisone 60 mg once a day. Because of the lack of improvement on the kidney function test to normal levels, the patient was declared to have end-stage renal disease and was discharged with the outpatient dialysis treatment program and to follow up with the nephrologist.

    "question": "A 71-year-old lady presented with an abnormal ECG finding during a scheduled primary care appointment. She was asymptomic and had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension, and dyslipidemia. During the consultation, the ECG reading showed premature ventricular contraction at a 1:1 ratio (ventricular bigeminy) with a heart rate of 46/min (). Her ECG from the previous year () showed non-specific changes, possibly related to early left ventricular hypertrophy. The recorded vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 159/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 62/min; and respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min. On physical examination, heart murmurs were not audible and other findings were unremarkable. The laboratory findings were: glycated hemoglobin, 7.1%; urea, 10.0 mg/dL; creatinine 1.0 mg/dL; Na+, 137 mEq/L; and K+, 3.6 mEq/L. In order to rule out secondary causes that could have led to the changes in the ECG, various blood investigations were ordered. An urgent appointment was scheduled a week later to review these results. The patient was also advised to seek urgent medical attention if she felt palpitations or giddiness. During the second consultation, a week later, the repeat ECG showed atrial flutter with a 3:1 atrioventricular block (). All the results of the blood investigations were normal (thyroid stimulating hormone, 4.26 \u00b5IU/mL; Na+, 135 mEq/L; K+, 4.4 mEq/L; corrected Ca2+, 8.9 mg/dL; PO4-, 0.32 mg/dL; hemoglobin, 12.9 g/dL; and white blood cell count, 7.4\u00d7103/\u00b5L), except for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (88 mm/h and 9.8 mg/L).\nUrgent transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated left atrium and ventricle without any myocardial hypokinetic changes. A large echogenic mass measuring 3.1\u00d74.1 cm was identified at the left atrium (). The mass was solid and appeared pedunculated, arising from a stalk at the endocardium. The patient had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 54%. The patient was immediately referred to a tertiary care cardiology clinic where a second transthoracic echocardiography was performed. An imaging diagnosis of left atrial myxoma was confirmed. The tumor measured approximately 2.9\u00d73.1 cm. A paroxysmal atrial fibrillation pattern was observed on the ECG. Warfarin treatment was initiated while aiming for a target international normalized ratio between 2 and 3. Currently, the patient is jointly cared for by the primary care physician and a multidisciplinary team that is helping to manage the anticoagulation therapy.

    "question": "A 73-year-old woman, with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus for 40 years, and chronic kidney disease stage 5, because of diabetic nephropathy, presented to the emergency department with dyspnea (NYHA IV). The patient had the following vital signs: blood pressure: 155/63 mmHg; pulse: 93 beats per minute; respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute; and her body temperature was 36.0\u2103. On physical examination, the patient had no notable findings, other than bilateral expiratory rales and neck vein distention. No heart murmurs or pericardial friction rub were heard. An electrocardiogram was within normal limits. A chest X-ray revealed marked cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Laboratory tests showed the following: white blood cell count: 10300/mm3, hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL, platelet count: 250000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen: 63 mg/dL, creatinine: 4.4 mg/dL, brain natriuretic peptide: 483 pg/mL, creatine kinase isoenzyme MB: 2.0 ng/mL, and troponin-I: 0.10 ng/mL. The patient received emergency hemodialysis because of pulmonary edema refractory to medical therapy, including high-dose furosemide infusion. After stabilizing the patient\u2019s volume status by regular hemodialysis, she received coronary angiography for the evaluation of ischemic heart disease on the 19th day of admission. The patient took aspirin (300 mg) and clopidogrel (300 mg) loading dose 12 hours before the procedure.\nExploration was performed via the right femoral artery. When the 0.025-inch straight guidewire (45 cm, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) for a 4 French sheath was advanced, some resistance was felt. We then checked the fluoroscopy and found that the guidewire was introduced into the circumflex iliac artery (). We promptly pulled the guidewire back from the circumflex iliac artery and advanced it into the abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic guidance. After the 4 French sheath was inserted, we checked the femoral angiography. Neither perforation nor dissection from the circumflex iliac artery was shown (). The external iliac artery and circumflex iliac arteries were intact, there were no changes in the patient\u2019s vital signs, and no abdominal symptoms were found, therefore, we continued the coronary angiography without incident.\nCoronary angiography revealed significant stenosis in the middle and distal segments of the right coronary artery and the middle segment of the left anterior descending artery. After 7000 IU of heparin was administered intravenously, we performed a PCI at the middle and distal right coronary artery and the mid-left anterior descending artery with an activated clotting time (ACT) of more than 300 seconds, without any immediate complications. Because the ACT remained prolonged, the sheath removal was performed 12 hours after PCI without any acute complications. Fourteen hours after PCI, the patient complained of a right abdominal pain, with mild swelling of her right abdomen. Her blood pressure abruptly dropped to 80/40 mmHg. We started hydration with normal saline and performed a transfusion of 2 pints of packed red blood cell because of an abrupt drop of hemoglobin from 9.3 to 7.3 g/dL over 12 hours. After hydration and transfusion, her blood pressure returned to 110/70 mmHg. The sheath site was clear with no evidence of bleeding, hence, we performed an abdominal computed tomography angiography to identify other causes of the bleeding, which revealed a right lateral abdominal wall hematoma about 5 cm in diameter (). The right circumflex iliac artery was located in the hematoma, but there was no evidence of active extravasation of contrast media. The patient\u2019s vital signs remained stable after hydration and transfusion, so we decided to closely observe her. However, the patient still complained of abdominal pain and ecchymotic patches appeared on her abdomen 3 days after the procedure (). Next, the patient underwent intermittent hemodialysis with minimal use of heparin and had her hemoglobin checked daily. After 5 days, her abdominal pain resolved and the ecchymosis gradually improved. There was no evidence of further hemoglobin changes. The patient was discharged uneventfully after 26 days of hospitalization (7 days after PCI). She was discharged on aspirin (100 mg), clopidogrel (75 mg), rosuvastatin (10 mg), losartan (50 mg), and carvedilol (6.25 mg). No further complications were evident, after one year of follow-up.

    "question": "The patient was an 82-year-old man, who had a history of hypertension for the past 20 years; his highest recorded blood pressure was 180/110 mmHg, and he took his oral antihypertensive drugs including telmisartan, irregularly. He also had a history of coronary heart disease for >10 years, and was taking oral antiplatelet drugs (aspirin) irregularly. He had experienced a sudden decrease of urine volume for the past 2 days, with abdominal distension and pain, followed by edema of both lower limbs, mental disorder, loss of appetite, and occasional cough and sputum; however, there was no fever or chills.\nThe patient was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital, and no urine output was noted after urethral catheterization. Following preliminary investigations, he was transferred to the Nephrology department, where physical examination revealed the following: temperature: 36 \u00b0C, heart rate: 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute, and blood pressure: 145/76 mmHg. The patient was unconscious, and patchy ecchymosis were visible in both arms, forearm, and right groin. The conjunctiva and lips were pale, and the respiratory sounds in both lungs were poorly audible; no wet rales were noted. The heart rhythm was irregular with well audible heart sounds, and the abdomen was distended. Muscular atrophy was noted in both lower limbs with visible tremor in the upper limbs, and the muscle power was of level 4.\nThe patient underwent the following tests in hospital on an emergency basis: total protein: 61.73 g/L, potassium: 6.00 mmol/L, sodium: 130.00 mmol/L, chloride: 96.00 mmol/L, anion gap: 23.90 mmol/L, urea: 65.05 mmol/L, creatinine: 756.00 \u03bcmol/L, and glucose: 6.70 mmol/L. In addition, blood analysis revealed: leukocyte count: 4.45 \u00d7 109/L, neutrophils: 71.70%, lymphocytes: 18.90%, red blood cell count: 3.17 \u00d7 1012/L, hemoglobin: 103.00 g/L, hematocrit: 0.30, and platelet count: 66.00 \u00d7 109/L. The myocardial enzyme levels were as follows: troponin T: 115 ng/L and myoglobin: 354.70 ng/mL. The initial diagnosis in the emergency department was that of acute renal failure, and he was accordingly transferred to the Department of Nephrology. He was finally diagnosed with acute renal injury, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease (grade III cardiac function), lung infection, old cerebral infarction, level 3 hypertension (high risk), prostatic hyperplasia (after prostatectomy), urethral stricture, and Parkinson syndrome.\nHe was administered diuretics, intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-infectives, and nutritional support at the Nephrology department.\nOn day 22 of admission, his blood pressure suddenly dropped to 86/55 mmHg, with a heart rate of 107 beats per minute, dyspnea, anuria (urine volume <100 mL/d), abdominal distention, cold extremities, and blood stasis. At this time, he was considered to have shock and insufficient organ perfusion, and was administered rehydration to improve cardiac output. However, the symptoms did not improve after administration of 500 mL of fluid. The symptoms of dyspnea worsened with further decline in blood pressure.\nThe critical-ultrasound specialists were urgently requested to perform the protocol of critical consultation ultrasonic examination (CCUE) at the bedside to evaluate the circulatory and respiratory functions (Tables and ). The ultrasound examination revealed: a cardiac output of approximately 3.08 L (although the ejection fraction was approximately 65%), widening of the inferior vena cava (Fig. ) and a low degree of variability with breathing, suggestive of volume overload, increased pulmonary artery pressure with right heart volume expansion (Fig. ), suggestive of right heart failure, diffuse B-lines in the entire lung, suggestive of severe pulmonary edema (Figs. and ), and contradictory motion of the interventricular septum, manifested by a rapidly expanding right ventricle squeezing the left ventricle, which results in left ventricular diastolic restriction (Fig. ).\nAll the above 5 conditions were indicative of volume overload. Excessive circulating fluid had aggravated the right heart failure and pulmonary edema. Therefore, under the guidance of bedside ultrasound, reverse fluid resuscitation was immediately instituted. Bedside continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated to promote a negative fluid balance. A volume of 800 mL of fluid was removed in 24 hours with CRRT. On the 2nd day, his blood pressure increased to 110/80 mmHg, and the tissue perfusion improved slightly. The CCUE protocol of critical ultrasound was repeated, and CRRT was administered based on the findings. We ensured that the daily fluid output exceeded input. A total volume of 3500 mL of fluid was removed within 72 hours. We can observe that the following time, with the increase of reverse fluid resuscitation, the patient's cardiac load were significantly improved, manifested as the increase of inferior vena cava variability and cardiac output, and the decrease of blood pressure and heart rate. In addition, lung ultrasound (LUS) showed that pulmonary edema also improved significantly, which may be related to the decrease of pulmonary capillary pressure.\nThe circulation stabilized, dyspnea improved, urine output was restored without support and creatinine levels were reduced to 352 \u03bcmol/L. The third session of bedside ultrasound showed a marked reduction of B-lines in both lungs, and A-lines appeared in the anterior thoracic region, and the LUS score was decreased (Table ), suggesting significant improvement of pulmonary edema. Echocardiography showed that the diameter of the left atrium, right ventricle, and right atrium had decreased, while left ventricular end-diastolic volume and inferior vena cava variability had increased (Table ). This suggested an improvement in his condition, with attainment of stability. Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?",

    "question": "Case 2 was a 37-year-old male with a PMH of SUD who presented to the ED in June 2020. He had reportedly been given naloxone from EMS after using opioids and reported not feeling well. He was uncooperative and shouting on arrival and complained of possible assault, noting right hip and back pain. His initial creatinine was 4.33 mg/dL and potassium was 6.9 mmol/L, which prompted reassessment for compartment syndrome. Examination with the patient standing showed edema and erythema of the right buttock. The left buttock, although less edematous, was also tense. Given those findings, he was transferred for emergent surgery evaluation. Additional laboratory studies included a CK of 218,142 U/L and a UDS positive for fentanyl, cocaine, cannabinoids, and amphetamines. He subsequently had CT imaging of his head, chest, abdomen and pelvis, which was remarkable for left lateral gluteal and pelvic musculature swelling, as well as edema of the right anterior abdominal musculature and right gluteus that were presumed to be secondary to blunt injury. He was taken to the OR that evening for left gluteal fasciotomy and was started on hemodialysis. On hospital day two, his right buttock was noted to be firm and he was taken back to the OR for right-sided gluteal fasciotomy. He also had renal recovery and was discharged on hospital day 18.

    "question": "A 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because he had been suffering from edema of the lower extremities for 1 month. He had a 5-year history of renal dysfunction, bile duct stenosis, and an inflammatory pancreatic mass. Additionally, 5 years prior to the presentation, he had a baseline serum creatinine level of 200 \u03bcmol/L. At that time, the patient had undergone choledochal stent implantation. Three years ago, the stent had been removed, and he had begun to take oral prednisone 30 mg/day. The bile duct stenosis and pancreatic mass had been successfully eliminated, so the prednisone treatment had been discontinued 3 months prior to presentation. In the past month, he had experienced rapid progression of renal function. His medical history also included hypertension and diabetes. With the exception of bilateral lower limb edema, the findings from the physical examination conducted at the time of presentation were unremarkable.\nLaboratory tests showed that his white blood cell count was 5.06 \u00d7 109/L; hemoglobin, 87 g/L; platelet count, 126 \u00d7 109/L; CRP, 30.23 mg/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 80 mm/H; serum nitrogen, 32.79 mmol/L; serum creatinine, 555.8 \u03bcmol/L; and serum albumin, 32.7 g/L. He had normal liver function with normal amylase and lipase levels. Urine analysis showed that the protein level was 2+; red blood cell count, 80/\u03bcL; urine gravity, 1.010; urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, 330; 24-h urine protein, 0.98\u20131.22 g; and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), 236 ng/mL.\nImmunological tests showed that the concentrations of serum C3 (complement 3) and serum C4 (complement 4) were lower than normal at 0.355 and <0.066 g/L respectively. Further, the patient had polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, as the total serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) level had increased to 31.7 g/L. However, the serum IgA and IgM concentrations were normal. The patient was negative for anti-self-antibodies, including antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded antibody, anti-Sjogren\u2019s syndrome A antibody, anti-Sjogren\u2019s syndrome B antibody, anti-proteinase 3, and anti-myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Analysis of the IgG subtypes showed that the serum IgG1 level and the serum IgG4 level were obviously elevated at 23.7 g/L (4.90\u201311.40) and 10.90 g/L (0.08\u20131.40), respectively. The mCRP autoantibodies level was also elevated at 64.25%.\nKidney ultrasound examination showed that both kidneys were of normal size (10.6 \u00d7 5.2 cm and 10.6 \u00d7 5.6 cm), with uniform echo frequency and clear corticomedullary boundaries; moreover, there were no mass lesions. Chest computed tomography showed that there were multiple nodules in the both lungs. The abdominal radiography findings were unremarkable.\nThe renal biopsy specimen exhibited severe tubulointerstitial changes, but the glomerulus shows no specific finding (). In particular, storiform fibrosis () and inflammatory cells infiltration including plasma cells () were marked in the interstitium. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that IgM, IgA, and C3 were present at low levels in the granular mesangial area. Electron microscopy demonstrated that there were no electron-dense deposits in the glomeruli. Immunohistochemical staining showed that most plasma cells in the interstitium were positive for CD138, and there were seven IgG4-positive plasma cells and thirteen IgG-positive plasma cells in the same area of serial sections). So, the percentage of IgG4-positive plasma cells among the total IgG-positive plasma cells was 53%.\nWe prescribed 25 mg/day oral prednisone and 0.6 g of cyclophosphamide (CTX) every month by intravenous infusion. The patient had been followed up for 6 months at the time of writing this paper. In the most recent follow-up examination, the serum creatinine level had decreased to 194 \u03bcmol/L, the serum C3 and serum C4 levels had increased to 0.668 and 0.209 g/L, respectively, and were close to normal, the serum IgG1 level was normal at 10.2 g/L, and the IgG4 level had considerably decreased to 3.72 g/L. Therefore, the dose of prednisone was decreased to 12.5 mg/day, and the cumulative dose of CTX was 3.6 g until to the time of writing this paper.

    "question": "A 62-year-old right-handed male with chronic renal failure due to chronic glomerulonephritis began to experience difficulty with speech and swallowing and was admitted to our hospital one month after the onset of these symptoms. At the age of 35, he had proteinuria and was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and kidney injury. He was diagnosed with possible membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) based on the results of a renal biopsy (see below). His systolic blood pressure was kept in control within 125\u2013140 mmHg. The patient's medications included amlodipine, carvedilol, furosemide, doxazosin, and sodium hydrogen carbonate. He had no history of smoking or any other toxic habits. His parents and siblings had been free from strokes, migraines, and dementia.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 160/82 mmHg and his pulse rate was 62 beats/min and regular. He was alert and did not have any mood disorder, migraines, scalp alopecia, or spinal osteoarthritis. A neurological examination showed left facial palsy, dysarthria, and dysphagia (pseudobulbar palsy). The Mini-Mental State Examination score was 27 of 30.\nPeripheral blood cell counts and biochemical studies showed moderate anemia (hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; hematocrit, 28.7%), impaired kidney function (blood urea nitrogen, 69 mg/dL; creatinine, 3.63 mg/dL; urinary protein excretion, 1.04 g/day), dyslipidemia (LDL-cholesterol, 89 mg/dL; HDL-cholesterol, 32 mg/dL; triglycerides, 183 mg/dL), and hyperhomocysteinemia (24.5 nmol/mL). No abnormality was detected in his antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, fibrinogen, d-dimer, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels.\nCerebral MRI demonstrated diffuse T2 hyperintense areas in the periventricular and subcortical white matter involving bilateral temporal poles and the external capsule (). On diffusion-weighted images, a hyperintense area was observed at the right frontal lobe, indicating a recent infarct. T2*-weighted images showed multiple microbleeds in the bilateral basal ganglia and subcortical areas. MR angiograms did not show any abnormal findings.\nSince he had severe white matter lesions, including the temporal pole, which is characteristic of CADASIL [], we performed a mutational analysis of the NOTCH3 gene after he provided informed consent. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient. Polymerase chain reaction- (PCR-) mediated direct sequencing demonstrated that no mutation was found in exons 3 and 4, which are hot spots in CADASIL. Then, we examined all other exons and splice sites of the NOTCH3 gene, and G to C transversion was detected in exon 24, c.4039G>C. It changed the codon 1347 from GGG to CGG, resulting in a p.Gly1347Arg substitution (). The DNA mutation numbering is based on the cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number NM_000435.2), with +1 corresponding to the A of the translational initiation site. The patient was heterozygous for this missense mutation. We did not find any other mutations or splice variants. The c.4039G>C change was absent in the database of common gene variations in the Japanese population (JSNP), in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database of the NCBI, and in 30 unrelated Japanese controls, who were examined after providing consent according to the ethics code of the Kyushu University Hospital.\nThe p.Gly1347Arg substitution was present in the EGF-like repeat domain 34 of the Notch3 extracellular domain. According to in silico analysis, this substitution was predicted to be \u201cprobably damaging\u201d with a score of 0.999 using polymorphism phenotyping-2 (PolyPhen-2, ) [], and it was also predicted to be \u201cdeleterious\u201d with a score of \u22124.930 as determined by Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN, ) [], thus indicating an adverse effect on the structure and function of the protein.\nThe renal biopsy specimens that had been obtained 28 years earlier showed mesangial cell proliferation with widening of the matrix in almost all glomeruli and an irregular thickened glomerular basement membrane with a \u201cdouble contour\u201d appearance (Figures and ). In the immunofluorescence studies, the staining of immunoglobulins G, A, M, and C3 was granular and located along the glomerular capillary loop (). Electron-dense deposits were confirmed in the subendothelial space by electron microscopy (). These findings were consistent with the findings of MPGN. On the other hand, severe hyaline changes of the arterioles were observed, especially from the efferent and afferent arterioles to glomerular arterioles (). Granular deposits were also found in many places in the thickened subendothelial basement membrane or the basement membrane-like material of the arterioles, similar to the findings of GOM by electron microscopy (). These findings were consistent with CADASIL, whereas the loss of medial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was not observed in the patient at that time.

    "question": "A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department with sudden onset paraplegia and pain in the lower extremities. His medical history included Crohn\u2019s disease, managed with sulfasalazine. He was otherwise healthy, worked as a tradesman, and was competing in fitness championships. There was no history of trauma to the back or abdomen. Earlier in the morning, while lifting a 10 kg object at work, he experienced sudden onset of bilateral leg pain and felt the urge to defecate. While in the bathroom, he lost power in his lower extremities and was found on the floor by his coworkers. Vital signs were stable upon ambulance crew arrival. The patient presented with abdominal and bilateral leg pain in addition to numbness and paralysis of the legs. He had faecal incontinence and had soiled his clothes and the floor. During ambulance transport, he received intravenous crystalloid fluids, ondansetron and a total of 25 mg of intravenous morphine.\nOn arrival to the resuscitation room at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital in Malm\u00f6, the patient was still complaining of pain, now primarily localised to the perianal region, and persistent paraplegia. His vital signs were within normal range, except blood pressure that was elevated at 180/90 mm Hg. His legs were pale, cold and numb with flaccid paralysis. Femoral and distal peripheral pulses were impalpable. Sensory loss extended distally from the umbilical level, whereas examination above the umbilical level was normal. Bedside ultrasonography revealed no free intra-abdominal fluid and the aorta appeared normal. On log-rolling, there was no sign of trauma or midline tenderness on palpation of the spine. Rectal examination revealed total loss of sphincter tone and sensation in the perianal area.

    "question": "A 24-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the signs of advanced chronic renal failure (CRF) in 2006. In his past history, he had developed kidney and bladder stones since he was 5-year-old. In his family history, his sister exhibited an elevated urine Ox concentration and his brother presented with kidney stones and renal failure. Unfortunately, they refused to cooperate with physicians to perform required tests until transplantation. Immediately in 1st day of admission, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) were determined 165 and 16.5 mg/dl, respectively, and also protein and glucose were detected in urine. The diagnostic findings indicate shrunken hyper-echogenic kidneys with hydronephrosis. Multiple stones with different sizes were observed in calyces of both kidneys. The bladder wall was thickened (4.7 mm), and urinalysis did not reveal any crystals. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) three times per week for 4 months. Four months after admission, the patient underwent bilateral nephrectomy. Based on the findings obtained in bilateral radical nephrectomy, chronic pyelonephritis with nephrolithiasis was confirmed. Microscopic examination revealed glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. About 2 years later (September 2008), the patient underwent living kidney transplantation with a diagnosis of ESRD. The primary graft function was acceptable? but 3 days after transplantation, the urine output suddenly dropped to 30-50 cc a day. Therefore, a renal biopsy was taken. Tissue sections containing glomeruli and tubules were obtained. The following histopathological data were gathered: The glomeruli showed no conspicuous changes, mild to moderate atrophy with mononuclear inflammatory cells and occasional eosinophilic infiltration of interstitium, some tubules contained marked Ox crystals, and some contained granular and white blood cells casts. Following the acute rejection, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was administered for the patient. After few days of ATG administration, the drug was discontinued because of fever. The possibility of PH1 was considered when a lot of Ox crystals were observed in the renal allograft biopsy and also by ruling out the other causes of hyperoxaluria. Therefore, pyridoxine therapy was commenced (dose, interval, and route of admin).\nIn January 2009, the patient's serum Cr and BUN levels were 4.8 and 38 mg/dl, respectively. The patient's computed tomography (CT) scan and radiography demonstrated cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusion with congestion, and calcification at the right pulmonary hilum and parenchyma. The molecular diagnostic polymerase chain reaction test revealed the persistence of cytomegalovirus. After few months, the patient refused to continue the treatment and finally he died 1-year later.

His diabetes was poorly controlled (A1c 8.8), and he had recently started empagliflozin in addition to metformin and insulin. Empagliflozin and metformin were held on the morning of surgery, and he underwent left femoral endarterectomy with common and external iliac stenting and left femoral to below-knee bypass using the ipsilateral saphenous vein.\nHis postoperative course initially followed the expected trajectory, but early in the morning of postoperative day 2, he developed acute-onset delirium with severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.2, PaCO2 of 19 mm Hg, bicarbonate of 8.9 mmol/L, and base deficit of 16.7 mmol/L with anion gap 24 mEq/L). Surprisingly, serum lactate was only mildly elevated (3 mmol/L). He was hypotensive requiring volume resuscitation and low-dose pressor support, despite brisk urine output. Workup did not demonstrate evidence of bleeding, infection, or cardiac event to explain his clinical condition. His serum glucose was relatively normal (170-200 mg/dL), but his urinalysis was significant for high urinary glucose and ketones (>500 mg/dL and 80 mg/dL, respectively). Of note, he had not received any insulin on postoperative day 1 given normal glucose levels.\nThe treating intensivist was familiar with the risk of euglycemic DKA with SGLT-2 inhibitors and started the patient on an insulin drip, resulting in normalization of the severe acidosis.

    "question": "At an initial visit in September 2006, a 46-year-old white male presented with edema, blood pressure indicative of hypertension (144/94 mmHg), heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL (123.76 \u03bcmol/L). He had experienced sudden onset of edema in his feet and legs 5 weeks prior to this initial visit, which caused him serious concern. At a height of 5 feet 8 inches (172.72 cm) and weighing 235 lbs (105.75 kg; up about 35 lbs [15.75 kg] from his usual weight), his body mass index was 35.7. He had not been on any medication regimen. Laboratory values included 24-hour urinary protein at >7,500 mg/dL (750.0 g/L) and cholesterol at 307 mg/dL (7.9513 mmol/L; low-density lipoprotein, 224 mg/dL [5.8016 mmol/L]). He was negative for cancer screening, hepatitis B and C panel, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and rapid plasmid reagin. He was started on olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide 40/25 mg for hypertension and proteinuria and simvastatin 40 mg for elevated cholesterol.\nThe patient was scheduled for a kidney biopsy for nephrotic range proteinuria in October 2006, which resulted in a diagnosis of idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy. Lisinopril 40 mg twice daily was added to his medication regimen. At this time, his creatinine was at 1.3 mg/dL (114.92 \u03bcmol/L).\nThe patient\u2019s membranous glomerulopathy progressed from October 2006 to July 2009, as revealed by laboratory results. During this period, he remained on an angiotensin receptor blocker (olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) treatment regimen. Since no improvement was observed, he then received cyclosporine A for 6 months, to which he was relatively adherent. No improvement was observed 3 months after initiation of cyclosporine A, so prednisone was added. Three months later, he developed shingles and was admitted to the hospital due to what was felt to be complications of cyclosporine A plus prednisone. Both cyclosporine A and prednisone were tapered off after the patient requested all immunosuppressive medications be stopped. Three months later, he agreed to be treated with mycophenolate, which he received for approximately 12 months but only during the last 3 months did he take it as prescribed.\nThe patient was agreeable to trying Acthar (80 USP U/mL) and received treatment from September 2009 to October 2010; his laboratory values during this period are summarized in . Acthar was self-administered subcutaneously at an initial dose of 40 U every 72 hours. After 3 months, the dose was increased to 80 U every 72 hours. In April 2010, his urinary protein levels rose to 9,520 mg/dL (952.0 g/L), and he required additional antihypertensive therapy. By July 2010, his urinary protein had dropped to 2,948 mg/dL (294.8 g/L). Thus, it took approximately 10 months of Acthar treatment to improve his urinary protein levels. By October 2010, his urinary protein levels had decreased further to 1,628 mg/dL (162.8 g/L). As shown in , in addition to the decline in urinary protein levels, the patient experienced decreases in creatinine and albumin levels, an increase in creatinine clearance, and modest weight gain while receiving treatment with Acthar.\nActhar treatment was stopped in October 2010 for several reasons. First, one year of ACTH treatment has been shown in European studies to be sufficient for resolving proteinuria.\u2013 In addition, the patient\u2019s laboratory results indicated clinically significant improvement in his signs of membranous nephropathy. Finally, the patient reported that his quality of life had improved, and he was not experiencing any symptoms of membranous nephropathy. He felt well and was able to return to his previous lifestyle.\nThe laboratory results since halting Acthar are also shown in . Urinary protein levels continued to decline overall, from 407 mg/dL (40.7 g/L) in December 2010, with slight elevation to 451 mg/dL (45.1 g/L; still within normal range) in March 2011, to 189 mg/dL (18.9 g/L) in September 2011. His protein to creatinine ratio was 0.58 in January 2012, and at that time his medications were limited to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) and angiotensin receptor blocker (olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide). As of May 1, 2012, his blood pressure was 124/78 mmHg, he weighed 199 lbs (89.55 kg), his heart rate was 81 beats per minute, and there was no evidence of edema. Current medications include olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide 40/12.5 mg once daily, lisinopril 40 mg once daily, and simvastatin 40 mg once daily.

    "question": "A 78-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and surgical resection of HCC was followed up for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to diabetes. The patient\u2019s medical history included hepatic steatosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 and ESRD. He had been prescribed metformin, pantoprazole, enalapril, felodipine, metoprolol. The patient was a non-smoker and non-drinker. At the age of 74 years, the patient was introduced to our hospital for HCC surgery (). His physical examination on admission was unremarkable. Liver enzymes and function tests, namely bilirubin (0.44 mg/dL), albumin (4.0 mg/dL), and International Normalized Ratio (1.06) were within the normal range, while creatinine was slightly elevated at 1.74 mg/dL. The patient underwent right lobectomy of the liver for HCC, and dialysis was initiated after surgery. At 5 months after the hepatic resection, computed tomography and chest radiography revealed multiple tumors in the lung, indicating metastatic disease (). At that time, serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II) was abnormally elevated (648 mAU/mL). The serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level was 5.7 ng/mL. The patient did not receive any anticancer therapy because of his ESRD and the advanced stage of HCC. We subsequently followed up on his natural course with serial imaging. Chest radiography revealed an increase in the size and number of lung metastases, and tumor markers were significantly elevated 4 months after recurrence (AFP, 1198 ng/mL; PIVKA-II, 214155 mAU/mL). However, 13 months after recurrence, the metastatic lesions suddenly decreased in size and number without receiving any specific treatment or herbal medicine (). Follow-up imaging showed no evidence of disease progression, and tumor makers were significantly decreased (AFP, <1.0 ng/mL; PIVKA-II, 46 mAU/mL) (). There were no signs of new lesions on imaging or an increase in tumor markers over 41 months after the recurrence.

    "question": "A 53-year-old white male was admitted for acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia 21 months after liver transplantation for hepatitis C. He had a past medical history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), recurrent hepatitis C after transplant (grade 2, stage 2), and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Approximately 2 weeks prior to admission, he was converted as an outpatient to a protease-inhibitor (atazanavir) based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. He presented to clinic with nausea, vomiting, a serum creatinine (SCr) of 6.3 mg/dL (baseline 1.7 mg/dL), potassium of 6.7 mEq/L, and an FK trough level > 30 ng/mL. He was subsequently admitted for hydration, treatment of hyperkalemia, and telemetry monitoring. Despite sodium polystyrene administration, hydration, and withholding of tacrolimus, and HAART, on hospital day 2, SCr remained at 6.2 mg/dL, potassium was 6 mEq/L, and FK was >30 ng/mL. Due to the magnitude of renal impairment, lack of knowledge of the precise quantitative FK level, and unpredictability of tacrolimus clearance in the presence of atazanavir use, the decision was made to initiate phenytoin as a means to induce drug metabolism. Phenytoin was administered orally at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. FK concentration decreased to 22.3 ng/mL the day after phenytoin initiation and then to 11.7 ng/mL the next day. Phenytoin was continued for 3 days, and the patient was discharged 3 days after admission with a SCr of 3.9 mg/dL and potassium level within normal range. HAART therapy was reintroduced at discharge and at an outpatient visit 2 days later tacrolimus was reinitated. SCr eventually returned to near-baseline at 1 week after discharge, and has remained stable ever since.

He was on warfarin and aspirin for his LVAD with goal INR of 1.5\u20132.0. He presented to the emergency department with light-headedness and hematochezia for several days. He had no prior history of GIB. His physical examination and vital signs were unremarkable. His INR was 2.8, creatinine was 2.3 mg/dl, and hemoglobin was 10.4 from baseline of 12 to 13 g/dl. His last screening colonoscopy was 4 years prior and was reportedly unremarkable. He was admitted for close monitoring, serial laboratory testing, and gastroenterology consultation. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealing a gastric ulcer with a clean base with no evidence of active bleeding. A colonoscopy revealed a likely malignant tumor in the cecum, diverticulosis, and nonbleeding colonic angiodysplastic lesions []. The cecal mass was biopsied; it appeared to be actively bleeding and uncontrollable endoscopically. These findings were relayed to the emergency general surgery team.\nHe was taken emergently to the operating room. A midline laparotomy was undertaken and he was found to have a cecal mass that was perforated into a retroperitoneal abscess. The right colon was mobilized to the hepatic flexure and the abscess cavity was debrided. A right colectomy was performed with a stapled side-to-side ileocolonic anastomosis. A drain was placed in the abscess cavity, fascia was closed, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues were packed with gauze.\nFinal pathology showed no evidence of malignancy. It revealed a transmural defect of 1.0 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm with organizing hematoma and acute on chronic inflammation. Cytomegalovirus testing was negative. There was focal re-epithelialization, thus making bleeding diverticulum a possible diagnosis.\nThe patient's postoperative course was complicated by prolonged ileus necessitating total parenteral nutrition and pelvic abscess that required percutaneous drain placement.

    "question": "A 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and seropositive rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed in 2014 presented to the nephrology clinic upon referral for evaluation of acute kidney injury, proteinuria, and hematuria. The patient first presented to her primary care physician in July 2017 due to a flu-like illness accompanied by nausea, stomach upset, and dark urine. She was prescribed a two-week course of ciprofloxacin by her primary care physician for a presumed urinary tract infection and then prescribed a two-week course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole due to persistent symptoms.\nIn August 2017, the patient presented to the emergency department with persistent nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and anorexia. Laboratory workup at this visit revealed an elevated creatinine of 1.79 mg/dL from a baseline creatinine of 0.75 mg/dL in February 2017. The patient received intravenous (IV) fluids and ondansetron. Further workup was non-contributory, and the patient was subsequently discharged to home with a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician. The following month, the patient presented to the emergency department with similar symptoms and was admitted to the hospital. Her creatinine upon presentation was 2.00 mg/dL, which improved to 1.56 mg/dL with IV fluids. She was discharged to home the following day with a plan to follow up with outpatient nephrology.\nThe patient presented to the nephrology clinic in September 2017 with persistent generalized fatigue, malaise, nausea, and occasional vomiting. She reported that her lack of energy affected her ability to perform her job. The patient\u2019s medications included levothyroxine 75 mcg daily, methotrexate 7.5 mg per week, etanercept 50 mg subcutaneous every week since January 2016, simvastatin 20 mg daily, famotidine, folic acid, vitamin D and biotin. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 37\u00b0C, a pulse of 72 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/92, and a respiratory rate of 18. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Initial laboratory workup was significant for a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 29 mg/dL (normal 7-20 mg/dL), creatinine level of 1.67 mg/dL (normal 0.6-1.0 mg/dL) and a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 3.30 (normal <0.5) (Table ). Additional workup revealed a positive antinuclear antibody, anti-SSA (Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome antigen A) antibody, anti-SSB (Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome antigen B) antibody, and anti-histone antibody (Table ).\nThe patient agreed to a kidney biopsy for further evaluation, and the renal specimen was examined under light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence. Under light microscopy, four out of 14 glomeruli were globally sclerotic and at least six showed fibrocellular crescents, most of which were circumferential. There was moderate interstitial fibrosis and associated tubular atrophy as well as chronic inflammation involving approximately 30-40% of the cortex (Figure ). Under immunofluorescence, some of the 14 glomeruli showed crescentic formation and the glomerular walls and mesangium, as well as some vessels, had granular staining of IgG (3+), IgA (2+), IgM (2+), C3 (2+), kappa (3+) and lambda (2 to 3+) light chains (Figure ). Electron microscopy of the specimen revealed crescentic changes, highly distorted capillary tufts, extensive foot process effacement on the capillary surface, and scattered electron densities predominantly in the intramembranous and mesangial areas and rarely in the subendothelial and subepithelial areas (Figures , ).\nThe biopsy results were significant for crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis with moderate interstitial fibrosis and moderate atherosclerosis. The patient was diagnosed with crescentic glomerulonephritis, attributed to etanercept in the clinical context as a diagnosis of exclusion. The etanercept was subsequently discontinued and the patient was prescribed steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient was closely followed up in the clinic and her creatinine gradually improved after stopping etanercept and beginning steroids and mycophenolate mofetil (Figure ).

    "question": "This is the case of a 57-year-old Colombian obese woman who was admitted to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and fever. Her medical history was positive for systemic arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nephrolithiasis. Ten days before the symptoms' onset, she underwent a dental procedure for tooth decay. In the beginning, she was treated in another facility for ketoacidosis, renal failure, and bacterial urinary tract infection, developing pneumonia as well. She required renal replacement therapy and received a course of antibiotics including aminopenicillins, carbapenems, and glycopeptides.\nDuring hospitalization, the patient suddenly presented right calf pain; a duplex ultrasound was requested evidencing deep venous thrombosis of soleal and peroneal veins. She complained as well of dyspnea, chest pain, and palpitations, raising the suspicion of pulmonary embolism (Wells' criteria: 4.5 points). Thoracic CT angiography showed thrombosis of the pulmonary trunk and both main branches, and the initial transthoracic echocardiography (4 days after admission) reported left ventricle diastolic dysfunction with impaired relaxation, trivial mitral regurgitation, mild right ventricle dilation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and an intermediate probability of pulmonary hypertension (PSAP 40 mmHg) with no other findings. Systemic thrombolysis with streptokinase was the chosen treatment for the high-risk pulmonary embolism; subsequently, she was started on enoxaparin with bridge therapy to warfarin.\nAfter thrombolysis, the patient remained febrile with chest discomfort despite antibiotic treatment suggesting dialysis catheter-related infection or bacterial endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram was carried out, revealing a mitral valve mass considered as a bacterial vegetation, and therefore, she continued receiving vancomycin. For exploring therapeutic alternatives, she was transferred to our hospital and stayed in the intensive care unit for one month. Her vital signs were normal (36.8\u00b0C, 95 beats per min, 20 breaths per min, 132/55 mmHg, SpO2 94% on room air), but she was pale and cardiopulmonary auscultation was positive for S3 sound. No heart murmurs, abnormal breath sounds, or jugular ingurgitation was detected.\nLaboratory analysis demonstrated leukocytosis (13.010 cells/\u03bcL), moderate anemia (7.4 g/dL), mild thrombocytopenia (146.000/\u03bcL), and increased C-reactive protein levels (17 mg/L, normal concentrations up to 5 mg/L). Moreover, renal function was severely compromised (creatinine 5.3 mg/dL and blood uremic nitrogen 42 mg/dL) and arterial blood gases showed metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.37, HCO3 13.9 mmol/L, PCO2 24 mmHg, SaO2 87%, and base excess -10.6). Urine cultures were positive for IRT-resistant Escherichia coli and azole-sensitive Candida albicans, while no germs could be isolated on blood cultures. Consequently, fluconazole was added to the antibiotic regimen.\nTransesophageal echocardiogram (16 days after admission) demonstrated preserved left ventricular dimensions and ejection fraction. Mitral valve exhibited a rounded image of 10 \u00d7 10 mm with hyperrefringent edges and hypoechogenic content within the anterior ring, corresponding to A1 and A2 segments (). This lesion did not compromise the valve function nor obstructed the left ventricle outflow tract. The rest of the valves, cavities, and vessels were normal, except for a small left pleural effusion. The density of the mass and the absence of any other imaging features compatible with endocarditis (i.e., highly and asynchronously mobile pedicled mass) supported the diagnosis of a blood cyst. Contrast echocardiogram with sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles was not available in our institution.\nAside from the mass, she did not fulfill any other Duke's criteria and blood cultures were negative. Besides, there was no valvular regurgitation that supported the diagnosis of a leaflet aneurysm and the cyst remained the same size in transesophageal echocardiogram despite anticoagulation, being less likely that it corresponded to a thrombus adhered to the valve in a patient with no predisposing factors. Researchers have highlighted elsewhere that echogenicity is the key to differentiate other entities (infections, neoplasms, and thrombi) from blood cysts as the last exhibit a homogenous hypoechogenic content []. Unfortunately, we could not obtain the initial transthoracic echocardiogram for reviewing and confirming that the mass was not present at that point.\nAfter 10 days of antifungals, the inflammatory response completely resolved and the antibiotic course was not extended as bacterial endocarditis was disregarded. The patient did not present any bleeding or embolic events and was discharged without any disability. Unfortunately, she did not attend to the Outpatient Clinic but, in a telephone follow-up, no recurrence of cardiovascular symptoms was reported.

    "question": "A 51-year-old male was diagnosed with glomerulonephritis by renal biopsy 25 years ago, and developed into chronic renal failure (uremia period), then received allogeneic kidney transplantation 2 years later. Cyclosporine A, azathioprine and a small dose of prednisolone were used to inhibit the immune response and reduce the rejection. The serum creatinine was lower than 2.3 mg/dL in the first 10 years after transplantation. Renal insufficiency began 15 years after transplantation. Other accompanying symptoms gradually appeared, including increased serum creatinine level, decreased urine volume, facial and lower extremities edema, hypertension, proteinuria, etc. There was little improvement of renal function after methylprednisolone shock therapy and renal nutrition treatment. The patient's condition worsened to uremia 15.5 years after transplantation and began regular hemodialysis. 21 years after transplantation, CT scan showed that there was a convex growth cyst-solid mixed mass in the cortex of the transplanted kidney. The volume was about 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.0 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm (Fig. A), which was increased to 2.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm in the 22nd year after transplantation. Considering that the transplanted kidney had lost its function and ruling out the possibility of tumor metastasis to surrounding tissues and distant organs, the patient received ICAN under general anesthesia.\nThe brief procedures of the operation were as follows. First, we exposed the transplanted kidney outside the peritoneum through an incision at the outer edge of the right lower rectus abdominis. We observed that the kidney adhered tightly to the surrounding tissues and could not be separated completely. Considering that sharp separation or forced dissection may cause serious damage to the surrounding organs or renal pedicle vessels, we decided to use ICAN. The inflammatory adhesive renal capsule was cut longitudinally along the long axis of the kidney, and separated with a vascular clamp in order to find out the space between the renal capsule and the cortex. The index finger was then extended into the space, and blunt separation was performed in the anterior, posterior, upper, and lower directions of the involved kidney. The adhesion of the renal pedicle at the hilum of the kidney was very light, therefore we cut the renal capsule at the renal hilum after bluntly separating in the loose plane under the renal capsule. Then the renal pedicle arteries and veins were together clamped, ligated, and cut, and the ureter was exposed and cut. Finally, the transplanted kidney was removed completely. During the operation, we had paid great attention to avoid massive hemorrhage caused by avulsion of the renal pedicle and antibiotics had been prophylactically used to prevent infection. The patient received regular hemodialysis treatment after the operation.\nGross observation showed that the transplanted kidney had atrophic changes. The tumor is located in the cortex of the transplanted kidney, with a convex growth, about 2.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm in diameter, and an intact capsule. After longitudinal incision, it was found that the tumor was multilocular cystic with a thick wall and granular inner surface (Fig. B, C). Histopathological examination revealed locally acquired cystic disease-associated renal cell carcinoma with focal hemorrhage, degeneration, fibrosis, and necrosis (Fig. ). The patient recovered well and was discharged 6 days after the operation. At the 12th month postoperation, no residual tumor or recurrence was found by imaging, and the creatinine level of the patient was about 3.5 mg/dL under hemodialysis treatment. The patient planned to have second kidney transplantation 6 months later, so we recommend that the immunosuppressive drug regimen be adjusted to mycophenolate mofetil because of the potential toxicity of cyclosporine A to the kidney.

    "question": "A 55-year-old female patient was examined in the emergency department with abdominal pain that had been persistent for ~10 days and having been aggravated for the last 3\u20134 days. Her past history was notable for diabetes mellitus (DM) for ~25 years. Additionally, she had undergone a coronary by-pass operation 10 years ago and a left infrapatellar amputation 4 years ago. Chronic renal failure had been diagnosed 2 years ago and she had been receiving hemodialysis treatment three times a week for the last 1 year. She had no history of abdominal trauma. Laboratory tests resulted with; White Blood Cell: 15 100/mm3, Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL, C-reactive protein: 40 mg/dL, Urea: 37.9 mg/dL, Creatinine: 2.25 mg/dL, Albumin: 2.4 g/dL, Sodium: 134 mmol/L, Potassium: 3.1 mmol/L, Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL, Glucose: 329 mg/dL and other biochemical parameters were normal. The abdomen was diffusely tender, and she also had guarding and rebound tenderness during the physical examination. Blood temperature was 38.7\u00b0C. An abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed diffuse intraabdominal free fluid collection. On an abdominal computed tomography (CT) there were free fluid collections in all abdominal quadrants; there also existed intraabdominal minimal free air images. There were air-fluid images in the splenic parenchyma (abscess?, perforation?) (Fig. a). The radiology department reported that it may be a gastrointestinal perforation. Based on the current findings, the patient was urgently operated according for a preliminary diagnosis of acute abdomen. Intraabdominal seropurulent fluid of ~2000 ml was aspirated perioperatively. There were diffuse fibrin matrixes in the entire peritoneum. No intestinal perforation was noted during exploration. There was a perforated abscess pouch with a size of ~8 \u00d7 6 cm2, which expanded posteriorly from splenic hilus and partly contained necrotic foci (Fig. b). Splenectomy and drainage were performed and the abdominal cavity was irrigated with abundant isotonic saline. Patient was postoperatively monitored in intubated state at intensive care unit. No proliferation occurred in her blood culture. Escherichia coli was isolated from the abscess culture, however, and Meropenem 500 mg I.V. (three times a day) and Metronidazole 500 mg I.V. (three times a day) treatment was commenced as recommended by the infectious diseases department. Her dialysis program was maintained according to blood parameters. The patient died on postoperative Day 25 due to septic shock and multiple organ failure. Histopathologic examination revealed suppurative inflammation and abscess formation of the splenic tissue (Fig. ). Informed consent was obtained from her son who participated in this case.

    "question": "An 82-year-old woman presented to our hospital\u2019s emergency department with new onset confusion. Her past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and age-related osteoporosis on intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate yearly.\nSix weeks prior to this admission, she was treated for pyelonephritis at a different hospital. At that time, laboratories were notable for a total calcium of 12.8 mg/dl (ref range, 8.4-10.5 mg/dl), albumin 3.6 g/dl (ref range, 3.5-5.3 g/dl), creatinine 1.6 mg/dl (ref range, 0.50-0.90 mg/dl), phosphorus of 2.7 mg/dl (ref range, 2.5-4.5 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 150 U/L (ref range, 35-105 U/L), parathyroid hormone (PTH) intact of 7 pg/ml (ref range, 15-65 pg/ml), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of 28.1 ng/ml (ref range 30-80 ng/ml). A 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D level was not checked. CT of the abdomen without contrast revealed fatty infiltration predominantly of the right lobe of the liver and two hypodense lesions, one at hepatic segment V (largest diameter of 8 cm) and another at hepatic segment VI (largest diameter of 3.4 cm). On the day of discharge, she had a calcium level of 10.6 mg/dl and a creatinine of 0.89 mg/dl. She was discharged with oral ciprofloxacin and 800 units of cholecalciferol daily in addition to her regular outpatient medications.\nOn presentation to our hospital, her initial vitals were temperature 98.3\u02daF, heart rate of 81 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18 cycles/minute, blood pressure of 142/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ambient air. Physical examination was notable for a cachectic, non-toxic appearing woman with altered mentation. Otherwise, physical examination was unremarkable. Initial laboratory data were notable for a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 19 mg/dl, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl, calcium level of 16.7 mg/dl, albumin of 3.4 g/dl ref (3.9-4.9 g/dl), hemoglobin of 9 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 79 fl, and ALP of 175 U/L. Bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were normal. CT head was negative for any acute pathology.\nA work-up for hypercalcemia showed a low serum intact PTH of 8 pg/ml (ref range 15-65 pg/dl) and a low parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) of <2 pmol/L. 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D was elevated at 81 pg/ml (ref range 19.9-79.3 pg/dl). The patient was admitted and treated for vitamin D dependent hypercalcemia with IV 0.9% sodium chloride infusion, subcutaneous calcitonin, and zoledronate infusion. Calcium levels were closely monitored and gradually trended down. Serum immunofixation did not identify a monoclonal band, and both serum and urine protein electrophoresis were normal.\nCT of the abdomen was performed and showed two adjacent hypoenhancing large masses in the right hepatic lobe with central areas of hypodensity/necrosis: one at segment V measuring approximately 8.8 \u00d7 7.1 \u00d7 5.7 cm, while the other at segment VI measuring 6 \u00d7 5.8 \u00d7 5.3 cm (Figure ). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were normal. Because the initial impression was concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma, a triphasic CT scan of the liver was done but provided no definitive diagnosis. Viral hepatitis serologies were also negative. A CT of the chest was unremarkable.\nPercutaneous liver biopsy under ultrasound guidance was then pursued. Histology, immunohistochemistry (Figure ), and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) report (Figure ) showed diffuse proliferation of atypical cells positive for CD10, BCL-2, and BCL-6 with low C-myc positivity, consistent with large B cell lymphoma. The patient was evaluated by the inpatient oncology team for chemotherapy. She was discharged five days later and is currently receiving rituxan-cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP regimen).

    "question": "A 54-year-old male was seen in our nephrology clinic for progressive increase in his serum creatinine from 1.38 to 3.66 mg/dl over 9 months. There was no history of fever, diarrhea, steatorrhea, urinary tract symptoms, renal stones, or use of nephrotoxic agents. His past medical history included hypertension for 15 years, type 2 diabetes for 11 years, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and treated cellulitis. He had undergone a duodenal switch procedure for morbid obesity (body mass index >50 kg/m2) 20 months earlier. Subsequently, he had lost more than 100 kg of body weight, and there was significant improvement in the control of blood pressure, sleep apnea, and blood sugar. His serum creatinine was 1.38 mg/dl and urinalysis was normal at the time of surgery.\nHis clinical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations showed hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dl, white cell count of 6.9 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl, blood urea nitrogen of 51.82 mg/dl, and serum creatinine of 3.66 mg/dl. Serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, and bicarbonate were within normal limits. Urinalysis showed 5-10 white cells/hpf and 1-2 white cell casts without any proteinuria or hematuria. Ultrasound of kidneys showed normal sized kidneys with a few small bilateral calculi without any evidence of obstruction. Doppler of renal arteries was normal.\nIn view of progressive unexplained increase in creatinine, a kidney biopsy was done. The kidney biopsy [Figures and ] demonstrated 13 glomeruli of which six were globally sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli were histologically normal. The tubular interstitial compartment showed foci of tubular damage with deposition of translucent crystals of different shapes which are predominantly intraluminal with few intracellular and focal interstitial distributions. Under polarized light, the deposits appeared strongly birefringent forming fan-like, sheaf-like, or irregular shapes consistent with calcium oxalate crystals. There was an associated mild interstitial inflammation with moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Blood vessels exhibited moderate arteriosclerosis and arteriolar hyalinosis. The immunofluorescence was negative and electron microscopy did not show any electron dense deposits but did reveal tubular damage with intratubular crystal deposition. His 24-h urinary oxalate level was found to be significantly elevated at 98.7 mg/day (normal range upto 40 mg/day). Urinary calcium and citrate were undetectable.\nA diagnosis of oxalate nephropathy secondary to enteric hyperoxaluria post-duodenal switch operation was made and he was started on low-oxalate, low-fat diet, with high-fluid intake (>3 liters per day). In addition, he was prescribed calcium citrate 1000 mg tid with meals as an oxalate binder. He was also started on cholestyramine 4 g twice daily and repeat urine oxalate improved markedly to 63 mg/day and his serum creatinine stabilized.

    "question": "A 68-year-old female was admitted to the hospital because of a 5-day history of left pleuritic chest pain. She had no other relevant medical history except for a ten-year history of hypertension. On admission, her blood pressure was 146/70 mm Hg and her body temperature was 36.9\u2103. Physical examination was unremarkable, and urinalysis did not reveal any abnormal findings. Laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin 11.7 g/dL, hematocrit 32.7%, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 6.9 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.74 mg/dL, sodium 130 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, total protein 5.6 g/dL, albumin 3.9 g/dL, and total cholesterol 167 mg/dL. According to chest X-ray, a pleural effusion was present in the left lower lobe. The pleural fluid (PF) was exudative, and PF analysis showed a pH of 7.4, total protein of 5800 mg/dL, albumin of 3200 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase of 679 IU/L, and glucose of 92 mg/dL. In addition, the white blood cell (WBC) count was 3879/mm3 with 99% mononuclear cells, and adenosine deaminase (ADA) was shown to be 104.0 IU/L in the PF. Pleural biopsy and pleural cytology were negative for malignancy. Based on the exudative characteristics and the high ADA level in the PF, pleural tuberculosis was suspected and anti-tuberculosis treatment was started. Treatment comprised rifampicin 600 mg/day, isoniazid 300 mg/day, ethambutol hydrochloride 1200 mg/day, and pyrazinamide 1500 mg/day.\nDuring the 4-week anti-tuberculosis therapy regimen, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, general weakness, and edema. Urinalysis revealed 4+proteinuria with a few transitional epithelial cells, some coarse granular casts, and many mucous threads. According to a 24-h urine collection, protein and albumin values were 9.2 and 6.2 g/day, respectively. Laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, WBC 5490/mm3, BUN 33.2 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.36 mg/dL, creatinine clearance 39 mL/min, total protein 5.6 g/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, serum aspartate aminotransferase 282 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 282 IU/L, normal total bilirubin, and a total cholesterol of 283 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody and P-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and C-ANCA were all negative with normal serum complement levels.\nAccording to a renal biopsy, MCD was present with focal thinning of the glomerular basement membrane (). Non-sclerotic glomeruli were normocellular without mesangial expansion, and the tubules showed minimal atrophy and mild focal tubular injury. Additionally, the interstitium was widened by minimal fibrosis, and no depositions of immunoglobulins or complement components were observed in the glomeruli. Electron microscopy showed the podocyte foot processes to be diffusely effaced ().\nDue to toxic hepatitis, rifampicin and isoniazid were discontinued, but ethambutol hydrochloride and pyrazinamide were maintained. Moxifloxacin was added after 1 week, and isoniazid was added after 2 weeks. The pleural tuberculosis was well controlled with isoniazid, ethambutol hydrochloride, and moxifloxacin thereafter.\nWhen her diagnosis was confirmed to be MCD, we determined to use steroid therapy at first. However, she was afraid of adverse effects of steroid treatment and asked us to observe closely. Moreover, we found out that heavy proteinuria was developed after using anti-tuberculosis agents. In addition, hepatitis also occurred after anti-tuberculosis agents started, and then we had to stop rifampicin and isoniazid agents. Fortunately, she improved spontaneously without steroid use only after quitting rifampicin. Therefore, we observed and followed up continuously. Her nausea, vomiting, and general edema improved and her body weight recovered from 68 kg to 63 kg at 3 weeks after rifampicin discontinuation, and a random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 0.14 at 8 weeks (). Furthermore, her serum albumin and cholesterol levels were shown to be 3.9 g/dL and 180 mg/dL, respectively, 8 weeks after stopping rifampicin.

Her baseline creatinine level was 1.5 mg/dL but had increased to 5.62 mg/dL over a period of 4 mo.\nShe has noticed bilateral lower-extremity edema and dyspnea on exertion 2 wk prior to the presentation. She denied any hemoptysis, chest pain, nausea, or vomiting. She had two episodes of epistaxis about a month prior to admission. She had two admissions over the prior 6 mo for hypertensive encephalopathy and influenza pneumonia with hypoxemic respiratory failure. There was no history of any invasive vascular procedures, use of radio-contrast agents, or treatment with anticoagulants or thrombolytic agents.\nHer relevant medical history included poorly controlled hypertension, hyperli-pidemia, transient ischemic attack (TIA), diastolic heart failure, reactive airway disease, nephrolithiasis status post-lithotripsy, and osteoarthritis with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage.\nShe reported no family history of renal disease or thrombosis. She was a non-smoker and not a current alcohol user.\nHer vitals were within normal limits and physical exam was normal except for bilateral lower-extremity edema and diminished breath sounds at the lung bases.\nLaboratory examination revealed normocytic normochromic anemia, serum eosino-philia (10%), hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, elevated creatinine (5.2 mg/dL), and elevated blood urea nitrogen (69 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed few red blood cells (RBCs), granular casts, and microalbuminuria and was negative for eosinophil and red cell casts. Serology was positive for antineutrophil antibody, anti-cardiolipin IgM antibody, and c-ANCA; 1:320.\nLiver function tests, troponins, creatinine kinase, serum magnesium, calcium, HbA1c, complement levels (C3, C4), serum immunoglobulin levels, coagulation studies including prothrombin time, protein C, S levels/activity, antithrombin III activity, and lupus anticoagulant were within normal limits. Additionally, D-dimer was positive, and factor V Leiden mutation was negative.\nHer perinuclear ANCA, atypical pANCA, anti-histone antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, myeloma panel (serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofluorescence), viral panel (hepatitis B, C; HIV serology), and urine toxicology tests were negative.\nA retroperitoneal ultrasound showed diffuse cortical thinning suggestive of medical renal disease but negative for obstructive uropathy. Non-contrast-enhanced com-puted tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was unremarkable except for diffuse atherosclerotic changes in the aortic arch. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, without any significant ischemic changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction and was negative for atrial myxoma, vegetation, or intracardiac thrombi.\nShe was clinically volume overloaded and had no oliguria. She responded well with good urine output to intravenous diuretics. Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis were improved upon initial medical management. In the background of rapidly worsening renal function with a positive titer of ANCA and history of epistaxis, ANCA-associated vasculitis was suspected; thus, she was started on pulse therapy of IV methylprednisolone 1 g/d. A renal biopsy was postponed to day 4 after admission due to relative contraindications such as aspirin usage, poorly controlled hyperten-sion, and the patient\u2019s inability to assume a prone position due to body habitus. Once she was medically optimized, an interventional radiologist performed the renal biopsy under anesthesia. She was discharged with prednisone 60 mg because the biopsy report was not yet available at the time of discharge.

His physical examination revealed livedo reticularis on the soles of his toes and a blue-purple discoloration of all toes bilaterally (), whereas his feet were warm to the touch and the peripheral pulse remained intact. Laboratory examinations revealed the following: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 64 mg/dL (reference range: 8-20 mg/dL); sCr, 7.23 mg/dL; white blood cell count, 9800/\u00b5L (reference range: 3900-9800/\u00b5L); eosinophils, 1092/\u00b5L (reference range: 0-400/\u00b5L); platelet count, 166 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L (reference range: 130-369 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L); erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 59 mm/h (reference range: 0-10 mm/h); serum albumin, 3.5 g/dL (reference range: 6.9-8.4 g/dL); triglycerides, 203 mg/dL (reference range: 40-185 mg/dL); low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 129 mg/dL (reference range: <139 mg/dL), fibrinogen, 410 mg/dL (reference range: 129-271 mg/dL); fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, 13.5 \u00b5g/mL (reference range: 0-5 \u00b5g/mL); D-dimer, 5900 \u00b5g/L (reference range: 0-1500 \u00b5g/L); PT-INR, 1.76; C3, 104 mg/dL (reference range: 86-160 mg/dL); C4, 45 mg/dL (reference range: 17-45 mg/dL); and C-reactive protein, 0.49 mg/dL (reference range: 0-0.14 mg/dL). Tests for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HBsAg antibodies, and antibodies to the hepatitis C virus were all negative. His urine was trace positive for protein, 2+ for occult blood, and contained 0.09 g of protein in a 24-hour specimen, whereas his creatinine clearance was 3.9 mL/min. The urinary excretion of \u03b22-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase was 22 856 \u00b5g/L (reference range: <200 \u00b5g/L) and 5.4 U/g\u00b7Cr (reference range: 0.9-2.4 U/g\u00b7Cr), respectively. A computed tomographic scan revealed a calcified thoracic aorta without a dimensional disorder and an infrarenal aortic aneurysm with a maximum diameter of approximately 4.4 cm. Diagnostic noncontrast-enhanced T2-weighted half-fourier-acquired single-shot turbo spin ecocho (HASTE) magnetic resonance imaging subsequently revealed hypointense areas and bright signals, which were suggestive of an atheromatous plaque consisting of lipids and fibrous tissues, respectively, in the abdominal aorta (). Oral warfarin was discontinued on admission, and the patient was subjected to empirical treatment with pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day combined with limaprost alfadex at a dose of 30 \u00b5g/day. A 5-mm-deep punch biopsy was performed on clinical day 7 within the territory of livedo reticularis on the lateral aspect of the left first toe. Typical biconvex needle-shaped empty spaces, suggestive of cholesterol clefts, were observed within the lumen of the arteriole in the subcutis (). A diagnosis of CES was made based on pathological and imaging findings as well as clinical manifestations.\nDue to the elevated D-dimer level of 10 600 \u00b5g/L confirmed on clinical day 8, the decision was made to resume anticoagulation therapy despite our failure to detect deep venous thrombotic lesions using ultrasonography. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin and then switched to warfarin 2.5 mg/day on clinical day 30. Oral prednisolone (PSL) at a dose of 20 mg/day was also initiated on clinical day 22, resulting in the amelioration of eosinophilia and cutaneous manifestations within a few days and the subsequent stabilization of sCr levels at approximately 4.3 mg/dL. His elevated blood pressure was also controlled at approximately 120-130/70-80 mm Hg with irbesartan (100 mg/day) and amlodipine besilate (5 mg/day). However, sCr levels started to increase when PSL was tapered to 5 mg/day. The patient developed general fatigue, appetite loss, decline in urine output, and progressive swelling in both legs without any calf pain at the end of September 2014, with an elevated sCr level of 8.07 mg/dL, and was readmitted for further examinations. Similar to his initial admission, a laboratory analysis at this point revealed mild hypoalbuminemia (3.6 g/dL), whereas echocardiography and chest radiograph findings did not support the concurrent presence of heart failure. The relationship between deteriorated cutaneous manifestations and recurrent eosinophilia of 1365/\u00b5L resulted in the diagnosis of relapsed CES. The patient received hemodialysis (HD). After the resumption of an increased dose of PSL (15 mg/day) and the addition of a transient session of LDL apheresis (LDL-A) to the therapeutic regimen, his cutaneous manifestations improved and eosinophilia disappeared; however, severely deteriorated renal function did not recover, and he was finally started on a periodic HD program with favorable volume control (). Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?",

    "question": "Herein, we present the case of a 37-year-old male RDEB patient admitted to our hospital. He had no genetic history, and no genetic tests were performed after admission. The patient experienced chronic blistering and erosion soon after his birth, continuing to admission to the hospital, resulting in scarring, contraction, and dactylosymphysis of the limbs. Repeated transplantation of cultured skin had been performed to treat skin defects. Chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly, and computed tomography showed narrowing of the abdominal aorta (the diameter was 12 mm at the bifurcation of the renal artery (normal\u201416 mm) and 13 mm at the splenic artery (normal\u201421 mm)), hepatomegaly and splenomegaly (). At 31 years old, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was detected at his skin ulcer, and he underwent radical surgery for recurrent SCC nine times. At 32 years old, there was marked deterioration of renal function and congestive heart failure. A renal biopsy was not performed because of the high risk to the patient, but a nephrologist diagnosed him with renal amyloidosis. His serum total protein level was 7.5 g/dL (normal 6.5\u20138.0 g/dL). The serum albumin level was 2.5 g/dL (normal 3.5\u20135.0 g/dL). The serum aspartate transaminase (AST) level was 12 U/L (normal <40 U/L). The serum alanine transaminase (ALT) level was 10 U/L (normal <35 U/L). The serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 110 IU/L (normal 100\u2013230 IU/L). The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 13.47 mg/dL (normal <0.30 mg/dL). The serum amyloid A (SAA) level was 1250 \u00b5g/mL (normal 0\u20138 \u00b5g/mL). The serum immunoglobulin G level was 2040 mg/dL (normal 800\u20131800 mg/dL). The serum rheumatoid factor level was 2 U/mL (normal <20 U/mL). Serum IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels were measured, but IL-1\u03b1 levels were below the detection limit, and IL-1\u03b2 was not significantly elevated, as compared with the normal control, which was partially due to the sensitivity of the system. The serum IL-18 level was 512.1 pg/mL (healthy control: 90.8 pg/mL), and the IL-17A level was more than five-time higher compared to healthy controls (data not shown). The serum creatinine level was 4.65 mg/dL (normal 0.60\u20131.40 mg/dL). The 24-h urinary protein level was 2.24 g/day (normal 0.02\u20130.06 g/day). Two years after the deterioration of his renal function, he started treatment with artificial hemodialysis. At 37 years old, he died due to the progression of emaciation. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Mie University (#2684). Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?",

    "question": "A 39-year-old female presented with complaints of generalized abdominal distension, weight loss, swelling of legs, and muscle weakness extant for several weeks. Her past medical history was significant for a well-controlled HIV infection of 6 years on highly active anti-retroviral therapy, hypertension, ESRD secondary to HIV-associated nephropathy, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. She was a non-smoker and had no history of alcohol or drug abuse. Her initial renal biopsy revealed collapsing focal glomerular sclerosis, microcystic dilation of renal tubules, lymphocytic interstitial infiltrates, and interstitial fibrosis. She received chronic cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD) for 5 years and was well controlled clinically regarding uremic and volume status with no abnormalities regarding color, viscosity, or volume of exchanges. Subsequently, she was transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis (HD) due to personal preferences. A few weeks after the transition to intermittent HD, ascites of unclear etiology developed, ultimately requiring repeated large-volume paracentesis with ~ 5 \u2013 7 L ascitic fluid removals every other week.\nThere were no associated symptoms of coughing, palpitations, or shortness of breath. She was chronically anuric. Vital signs showed blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg, heart rate 74 beats/min (regular), respiratory rate 16/min and temperature 36.9 \u00b0C. Oxygen saturation was 98% on ambient room air. Her physical examination was remarkable for moderate ascites and edema of the lower extremities. Otherwise neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular examinations were normal without organomegaly and without clinical stigmata or symptoms of chronic liver disease or heart failure.\nLaboratory investigations showed normocytic, normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL and uncorrected serum calcium of 8.6 mg/dL. Other labs were as follows: CD4 T-cell count: 600/mm3, HIV viral load: 986 copies/mL (reference: < 40 copies/mL), serum creatinine: 10.3 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase: 13 U/L (normal range: 5 \u2013 34 U/L), alanine aminotransferase: 17 U/L (5 \u2013 45 U/L), bilirubin: 0.4 mg/dL, prothrombin time INR: 1.01, serum albumin: 2.3 mg/dL, serum amylase: 105 IU/L (27 \u2013 130 U/L), serum lipase: 40 IU/L (8 \u2013 78 U/L). Her tumor antigens (Ag) were within reference range for cancer antigen (CA) 15-3 and CA19-9. CA 125 levels were repeatedly elevated (197 \u2013 416 U/mL (normal: < 34.9 U/mL)), but no further follow-up was obtained. Analysis of the ascites fluid showed an albumin level of 1.5 g/dL and protein of 3.5 g/dL. The serum-to-ascites albumin gradient was < 1.1 excluding portal hypertension as a cause of ascites. The culture of peritoneal fluid was negative for acid-fast bacilli. There were no fungi seen by calcofluor white stain. Histoplasma Ag and Aspergillus Ag were negative. The pancreas was reported normal on computed tomography. Her \u03b2-2 microglobulin was elevated to 47.30 mg/L (normal: 0.80 \u2013 2.3). Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminemia and decreased total protein, with minimal monoclonal M-component only (IgG-\u03ba 0.30 g/dL in the \u03b3 zone). Immunofixation electrophoresis showed polyclonal immunoglobulins (Ig) with polyclonal light chains. \u03ba and \u03bb light chains were increased to 66.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.33 \u2013 1.94) and 18.55 mg/dL (normal: 0.57 \u2013 2.63), respectively, yielding a ratio of 3.6 (normal: 0.26 \u2013 1.65) (). Ascitic fluid analysis showed a marked increase in plasma cells with an abnormal \u03ba : \u03bb ratio, i.e., > 5 : 1.\nLiver biopsy was essentially normal, hence an omental biopsy was performed which on immunohistochemistry showed similar findings as the ascitic fluid with predominant \u03ba and faint \u03bb staining (). Multiple myeloma work-ups with skeletal surveys revealed no focal osseous lesions, apart from the osseous changes of hyperparathyroidism. Accordingly, the diagnosis of omental EMP with malignant ascites was established. Omental resection and radiation were offered to the patient, but she refused further intervention. Two years of follow-up, she remained stable without any further complication, apart from requiring regular paracenteses.

His nursing home stated he was unusually drowsy with episodes of oxygen desaturation down to 60% with shallow breathing and unresponsiveness. His medical history was significant for hypertension, congestive heart failure, and schizoaffective disorder. On presentation, the temperature was 37.8 C, the blood pressure 67/42 mmHg, the pulse 76 beats/min, the respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 60% on ambient air. He was unresponsive to painful stimulation. Labs were notable for thrombocytopenia (77k/\u00b5L), absolute lymphopenia (0.49k/\u00b5L), blood urea nitrogen of 53 mg/dL, and creatine of 1.9 mg/dL. Initial chest X-ray () revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates in middle and lower lung fields consistent with pneumonia. Norepinephrine drip and fluids were given for management of hypotension. Given his low oxygen saturation, he was intubated for mechanical ventilation and admitted to the critical care floor. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative. On hospital day 3 of admission, another nasopharyngeal swab was sent and returned positive for SARS-CoV-2. On day 7, he was extubated following a spontaneous breathing trial with oxygen saturation 99% on 4 L of nasal cannula.

    "question": "We report the case of a 20-year-old Caucasian, nonsmoking female student, height 185 cm, weight 66 kg, who developed pain of the left pinna which is why she attended the otolaryngological ambulatory unit two days later (). The left pinna was found to be sore and reddish but without vesicles, which is why chondritis was diagnosed and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid prescribed. One day later she awaked with a peripheral facial nerve palsy on the left side and hypoesthesia of the left upper lip. The weeks before onset she had a lot of stress with her studies at the university but there was no fever, no vaccination, or infection. A few days before onset of the palsy she recognised dysesthesias of the parietal skull on the left side. The night before onset of the palsy she was exposed against the ventilator of an air condition for more than an hour. She was regularly taking loratadine.\nClinical neurologic examination on admission revealed slight hypoesthesia of the left upper lip, moderate peripheral facial nerve palsy, and generally reduced tendon reflexes. The left pinna showed an erythematous rash but no vesicles. Hearing and taste were normal and there was no vertigo, double vision, skew deviation, nystagmus, headache, hyposmia, or ataxia []. Blood chemical investigations revealed slight leucopenia but normal C-reactive protein. Ophthalmologic examinations excluded a zoster of the eye. Immediately after admission, she was treated with dexamethasone (40 mg intramuscularly) during two days followed by dexamethasone orally during another six days. Additionally, she received 750 mg acyclovir three times a day intravenously during eight days. For continuous pain periauricularly she received mefenamic acid and paracetamol with success.\nAt followup three days later she reported some transient vesicles at the left pinna, no longer visible at the visit, lid closure had improved, and there was recovery from the pinna's rash but only marginal voluntary innervation of the frontalis and lower facial muscles. Audiometry was normal. Followup six days after onset of the palsy showed complete lid closure but unchanged innervation of the other facial muscles. She reported neuralgiform pain in the left ear which is why gabapentin was prescribed with success. Eleven days after onset of facial palsy lid closure on the left side was complete. There were slight innervation of the frontal branch and only slight innervation of the left mouth corner. Nerve conduction studies 12 days after onset showed almost equal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude when recording from the orbicularis oculi muscle but >50% amplitude reduction on the left side when recording from the orbicularis oris muscle. Antibodies against the varicella zoster virus (VZV) were determined three times by means of an ELISA test. IgG antibodies against VZV were positive at all three determinations and IgM antibodies against VZV were negative at the first and positive at the second and third determination, which is why valacyclovir orally was given for seven days after discontinuation of acyclovir. Antibodies against other viruses and Borrelia burgdorferi were normal. Follow-up 6 weeks after onset showed further recovery of the palsy, such that it was no longer visible in the absence of emotional reactions. Nerve conduction studies confirmed the improvement such that the CMAP amplitude difference was only reduced to 30%.

    "question": "A healthy 21-year-old, 69 kg, 170 cm primigravida presented at 38 weeks gestation for elective cesarean section due to fetal anomalies. A spinal anesthetic was performed in the sitting position with 10.5 mg of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine, 10 mcg fentanyl and 200 mcg of morphine. After an uncomplicated intrathecal (IT) injection, she was positioned supine with left uterine displacement. A sensory block was present to T3 bilaterally.\nThe surgery proceeded uneventfully and a viable infant was delivered. Approximately 40 min after the IT injection, the uterus was externalized for hysterotomy repair. Shortly thereafter, the patient complained of right sided peri-oral numbness, dysphagia and dysarthria. Five minutes later she developed a constellation of neurologic symptoms including: Horizontal nystagmus of the right eye, right sided ptosis with facial droop and right upper extremity weakness with a \u201cclaw hand\u201d (hand strength 2/5). Vital signs and mentation remained normal. She denied shortness of breath or chest pain. Differential diagnosis at that time included: High spinal, stroke or transient ischemic attack, air embolus, amniotic fluid embolus and seizure.\nAt the conclusion of surgery, the neurologic symptoms were unchanged. A non-contrast computed tomography of the head showed no intracranial pathology. Approximately, 90 min after the IT injection, her facial droop and ptosis began to resolve but the right upper extremity weakness persisted. All neurologic symptoms resolved within 120 min. A brain magnetic resonance imaging and a magnetic resonance angiography of the neck vessels were negative.

    "question": "The 67-year old, male patient (164 cm, 70 kg) with chronic renal failure was supposed to undergo arteriovenous bridge graft of the upper arm for hemodialysis under high level thoracic epidural anesthesia. Patient history revealed that he underwent coronary bypass graft six years ago and was taking antihypertensive agents and insulin for hypertension and diabetes. Blood tests performed after hemodialysis on the day before the operation showed hemoglobin 11.3 g/dl, hematocrit 36.3%, glucose 202 mg/dl, Na 136 mmol/L, K 5.2 mmol/L, Cl 97 mmol/L, BUN 43 mg/dl, and creatinine 4.5 mg/dl. Test results on the day of the operation showed that the platelet count and coagulation profile (prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen) were in the normal ranges.\nWhen the patient arrived at the operation room, blood pressure was 135/89 mmHg, and heart rate was 64 bpm. The high level thoracic epidural anesthesia was performed in the sitting position, and an assistant supported both shoulders of the patient so that the patient could lower his head to the maximum (). The first prominent spinous process of the cervical spine, which is the C6 spinous process, was identified []. Referring to that, local infiltration of 2% lidocaine 2 ml was performed in the middle line between the T1 and T2 spinous processes. Then, for the loss of resistance technique, a 5 ml glass syringe was connected to a 17-G Tuohy needle (ARROW\u00ae, Arrow International Inc., USA), and the needle was moved to the epidural space by the midline approach. When it moved into the 4.5 cm position from the skin, the plunge of the glass syringe was sucked inside, and the hanging drop method was performed at that position. As a result, the epidural space was positively identified, the loss of resistance technique to air was performed to verify that the loss of resistance was positive, and the drip infusion method showed that the normal saline was dropping at a rate of one drop per second or higher.\nAfter that, an 18-G epidural catheter (ARROW\u00ae, Arrow International Inc., USA) was inserted through the Tuohy needle. The epidural catheter was inserted without particular resistance up to 3 cm inside the epidural space. After fixing the catheter, the patient's position was altered to the supine position, and 1% lidocaine 3 ml containing 1:200,000 epinephrine was injected through the catheter as the test dose. There was no change in blood pressure and heart rate at five minutes after the test injection. The sensory change on both upper arm medial sides was not accurately verified since the patient was unable to cooperate well. For epidural anesthesia, a mixture of 0.375% ropivacaine 15 ml and fentanyl 50 \u00b5g was injected through the epidural catheter. Pin-prick tests at 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes after drug injection showed that pain had not been alleviated at all, and vital signs were not changed.\nJudging that the epidural anesthesia failed, general anesthesia was performed under the agreement of the patient. To induce general anesthesia, 2% lidocaine 2 ml-propofol 2 mg/kg-atracurium 0.6 mg/kg was intravenously injected, and the anesthesia was maintained with O2-N2O-desflurane. The operation was carried out for 1.5 hours, and epidural anesthesia failure was reconfirmed when the patient complained of pain in the operated region in the recovery room. To find out the causes of the epidural anesthesia failure, iohexol 5 ml was injected through the epidural catheter and radiographic images were taken (). However, since the accurate position of the catheter was not found, cervical and thoracic computed tomography (CT) was performed after ensuring the patient that the hospital would cover the cost of the CT and receiving agreement from the patient and caregiver. CT findings revealed that the catheter had entered between T1 and T2 but failed to penetrate into the ligamentum flavum, proceeded along the T2 right lamina, and was eventually positioned within the erecter spinae muscle after converting the direction backwards ().

    "question": "A 90-year-old woman presented at our institution suffering from right hip joint pain that had been absent since an earlier visit when she was 83 years old. Her height was 153 cm and her body weight was 58 kg. She had a history of hypertension. The clinical course of her joint pain was as follows: she initially complained of continued right hip joint pain at the age of 83 years and 3 months. Therefore, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration and bisphosphonate (BP) treatment for osteoporosis were given. A mild thoracic vertebral compression fracture was also observed approximately 7 years earlier at the patient\u2019s first visit. Osteoporotic treatment with BP had been continued since that time. Right hip bone mineral density (BMD) 7 years prior and at present were 0.915 (T score = -1.7) and 1.094 (T score = -0.1), respectively. Left hip BMD had risen from 0.702 (T score = -1.9) 7 years earlier to 0.755 (T score = -1.5) at present. During follow-up, she sometimes complained of mild hip joint pain. At the time of this report, her joint pain was substantially decreased.\nRight hip range of motion (ROM) was slightly restricted at the patient\u2019s first visit, but did not worsen over 7 years.\nA right hip plain radiograph at age 83 showed joint space narrowing (Kellgren-Lawrence [KL] grading II) [] (Fig. ) that was diagnosed as radiographic OA. There was no acetabular dysplasia. At the age of 83 years and 8 months, plain radiographs revealed greater joint space narrowing, a band around the bone defect change-like osteonecrosis, and a concave shape to the right femoral head (Fig. ). The necrotic region of the femoral head had progressed a year after onset and was noticeably worsened at the age of 86 (Fig. , ). Ensuing radiographs showed progressive destruction of the femoral head and osteosclerotic change of the remaining joint line (Fig. ). In addition, radiographs retrospectively uncovered a laddering-shaped deformity in the right lateral proximal femoral head and a fracture-like line that were consistent with the necrotic region (Fig. , arrow).\nThe particularity of this case was that 1) the patient was initially diagnosed as having radiographic OA, 2) joint pain was markedly improved after a few months, 3) the femoral head degenerated over several years in the absence of joint pain, and 4) radiographic diagnosis changed based on the timing of disease progression.\nThe patient was informed that the data from her case would be submitted for publication and gave her consent.

Her most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 60-65% and no significant valvular disease.\nOn examination, she was 165 cm tall and weighed 58 kg with a BMI of 21 kg/m2. Her vital signs were normal. A pelvic exam showed an anteverted, 8-week size uterus. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a uterus measuring 7.1 cm length \u00d7 8.1 cm width \u00d7 4.6 cm depth with normal appearing ovaries. On 3D transvaginal ultrasound, the uterine septum had a 2 cm deep indentation with an angle of 65\u00b0 (). A hysterosalpingogram showed two uterine cornua with normal appearing and patent fallopian tubes (). Laboratory studies were unremarkable and included an estradiol level of 81 pg/mL, a follicle stimulating hormone level of 2.8 mIU/mL, a luteinizing hormone level of 11.1 mIU/mL, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level of 0.860 \u03bcIU/mL.\nShe conceived her first pregnancy spontaneously 2 months after the hysterosalpingogram was performed. Part of the uterine septum can be seen on an 18-week obstetrical ultrasound performed in this first pregnancy (). During her first pregnancy, she was diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe features at 37 weeks of gestation at an outside hospital. An ECV was performed, followed by induction of labor and an uncomplicated vaginal delivery.\nThe patient then conceived her second pregnancy spontaneously 4 months after her first delivery. She received prenatal care by an outside clinic that does not offer ECVs and was referred to our obstetrical triage unit for the procedure. On presentation to our hospital, she was a 20-year-old gravida 2 para 1001 at 37 weeks and 6 days of gestational age with confirmed breech presentation and a posterior placenta. The estimated fetal weight by ultrasound was 3003 grams, and maximum vertical amniotic fluid pocket was 5.7 cm. Risks and benefits of an ECV were discussed with the patient, and consent was obtained. At 38 weeks and 0 days, an ECV was performed in the operating room under epidural anesthesia with administration of 0.25 mg subcutaneous terbutaline. The fetus was in frank breech position with the fetal head in the maternal right upper quadrant and back facing up and to the maternal left. The fetal rump was elevated out of the pelvis while pressure was simultaneously applied to the fetal head to direct it towards the pelvis. The ECV was successful on the second attempt, and anti-D immune globulin was administered after the procedure.\nAfter the ECV, the patient was discharged home and scheduled to return for induction of labor at 39 weeks 0 days. When she returned for induction of labor, breech position was again observed by ultrasound. An epidural was placed, ECV was performed again in the operating room easily and without complications, and the patient was transferred to labor and delivery for induction of labor. During labor, the patient was diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe blood pressures and started on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis.\nA singleton male in cephalic position was delivered vaginally at 39 weeks 2 days of gestation weighing 3510 grams with Apgar scores of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. After delivery of the fetus and placenta, there were retained membranes that did not deliver with gentle traction. Manual uterine exploration revealed membranes firmly adhered in the right cornu which was felt to have contracted around the membranes holding them in place. The membranes were removed manually with traction. Manual uterine exploration afterwards revealed a thick uterine septum consistent with previous 3D TVUS and hysterosalpingogram findings. The postpartum course was uncomplicated, and another dose of anti-D immune globin was administered on postpartum day 2 since the infant was Rh positive. The mother and infant were both discharged on postpartum day 2. Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?",

    "question": "A 52-year-old male obese patient (weight 115 kg, height 181 cm), with history of hypertension, analgesics abuse due to chronic back pain, came to Emergency Department for repeated massive hematemesis episodes. Upon arrival, the patient was conscious, with slightly reduced response to painful stimulation and regularly reflexive pupils; vital signs were recorded: heart rate was 145 bpm, non-invasive blood pressure 80/45 mmHg, SpO2 86% in room air. Blood tests were performed, urinary catheter and indwelling arterial line for blood pressure monitoring and serial blood gas measurements were placed. After anamnesis excluded presence of active liver disease and esophageal varices, the patients signed the informed consent so that a gastric tube was gently positioned to drain blood from stomach, and immediately after a Sengstaken Blackmore tube to in an attempt to stop bleeding.\nEmergency endoscopy was arranged and performed with locally sprayed 10% lidocaine and minimal sedation with midazolam 1 mg, resulting in failure to identify and control active source of bleeding with endoscopic treatment. Following the worsening of hemodynamic conditions and impossibility to stop bleeding, immediate surgical access was scheduled. Patient was moved to operatory room and, under vital parameters monitoring and 3 minutes preoxygenation in 100% oxygen, a rapid sequence induction was performed with etomidate 0.2 mg*kg-1, suxamethonium 1 mg*kg-1, and fentanil 100 mcg. Cricoid pressure (CP) was applied in order to decrease the risk of regurgitation. Before the procedure, patient was not carefully studied for airway management, due to urgent setting, but a Mallampati 3 score and slightly reduced neck movement were recorded. At a first direct laryngoscopy, no glottic structures were visible; a second attempt, after aspiration of blood and releasing of CP, showed a Cormack-Lehane 3 grade with partial view of lingual border of epiglottis.\nIntubation was attempted blindly twice with styletted tube, unsuccessfully, whereas ventilation by face-mask was getting quickly worse. As the oxygen saturation was descending rapidly (spO2 60%), a number 4 classic LMA was placed after repeated mouth aspiration. Mask was inflated accordingly to manufacturers' instruction (25 ml of air) and manual ventilation was obtained via gentle but frequent insufflation with 100% Oxygen. Once saturation was fully recovered, considering emergency surgery and aspiration risk, the decision to intubate through LMA was taken.\nOptical instruments (video/fiberoptical) were not available. We then inserted a 16 Fr standard nasogastric tube (NGT) blindly through LMA, finding indirect sign of passage in trachea in easy advancement without resistance and repeated free air aspiration. Then, we cut proximal tip of NGT and kept granting ventilation passing proximal end of NGT via holed catheter mount. Next, proximal part of LMA with glued connector was cut and removed to allow passage of a 7,5 mm endotracheal tube (ET) through LMA by railroading on NGT [].\nBefore removing the LMA, the ET cuff was inflated and position confirmed by capnography.\nAfter successful intubation, surgery started and patient was successfully treated for duodenal ulcer. Vital parameters were stable throughout the operation, but blood and plasma transfusion were necessary according to blood test results. At the end of the surgery, the patient was moved to intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring and uneventfully extubated the day after using a safe extubation technique.[] Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?",

    "question": "Our patient was a 62-year-old male, 175 cm tall who complained about dyspnea on exertion (NYHA class III). The patient was on beta blocker, warfarin, and diuretic and his rhythm was atrial fibrillation. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography was performed and severe mitral stenosis was established. Mitral valve area was 0.8 cm2 and no thrombus was found in the left atrium and its appendage. In addition, Wilkins score was 6 and systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 38 mmHg.\nThe patient was candidatedfor BMV.\nBefore attempting for valvulotomy, coronary artery status was determined. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated no significant obstruction in the coronary arteries. First, the right femoral vein was approached, but it could not be accessed; therefore, the left femoral vein was punctured. Then, the retrograde injection of the contrast media in the proximal of the right external illiac vein showed that the right femoral vein was occluded. Thus, we decided to continue the procedure from the left side.\nTransseptal puncture of the interatrial septum was performed via the left femoral vein using Brocken Brugh needle. After dilatation of this puncture site, Inoue balloon 28 was used and graded inflation was done with 24, 26, and 28 cc. The mean transmitral valve gradient was declined from 16 mmHg to 3 mmHg and the left ventricudar injection revealed no mitral regurgitation. After all, the procedure was terminated without any complications.\nThe patient was discharged two days after the procedure with beta blocker and anticoagulant (warfarin) due to atrial fibrillation rhythm.

    "question": "A 34-year-old male presented with recurrent carpopedal spasms of 4 years duration with perioral numbness, cramps, muscle twitching and generalized weakness for which he was evaluated 2 years back and found to have hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, high PTH without AHO phenotype. He was given provisional diagnosis of PHP and started on calcium and 1\u03b1-calcidiol. Presently he reported for review. He was symptomatically improved with treatment. There was no family history of similar illness, or bony abnormality. On examination he was 184 cm tall with weight of 78 kg (BMI 23 kg/m2). He had no evidence of AHO phenotype. Latent signs of tetany in the form of positive Chvostek's sign and Trousseau's sign were present. We decided to re-evaluate him in view of late age of onset of symptoms, absence of AHO phenotype, and to confirm the diagnosis. His medications were stopped for 7 days. Investigations revealed normal renal parameters (serum creatinine, 88.4 \u03bcmol/L) and normal serum magnesium (0.86 mmol/L), 25(OH)D levels (137.2 nmol/L) and raised PTH (63 pmol/L). His computed tomography scan of the brain was normal. His bone mineral density (T score,0.5 at L1-L4 and \u20130.2 at femur neck) and thyroid function were normal (T3 0.87 ng/mL, T4 7.59 \u03bcg/dL, TSH, 2.20 mIU/L). In view of hypocalcemia with raised PTH three possibilities were entertained\u2014idiopathic hypoparathyroidism with heterophile antibody against PTH, PHP1b, or PHP2. For the first possibility his serum was precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for detection of heterophile antibodies.[] His PEG precipitated serum PTH levels were also high (61.5 pmol/L). Modified Ellsworth Howard test[] was planned to differentiate between PHP1b and PHP2. Since this test was performed first time in this institute, it was planned in three subjects: one present case, one healthy age- and sex-matched control and another known case of postoperative hypoparathyroidism. The protocol starts with oral hydration with 200 mL water every 30 min starting at 0600 hours in the morning. Starting from 0830 hours, timed urine collection is done every 30 min and blood samples are collected at midpoint of each till 1100 hours. From 1000 to 1010 hours, teriparatide is infused intravenously in the dose of 5 units/kg (200 units maximum; conversion factor 20 \u03bcg = 67 units). Each sample is analyzed for phosphate, creatinine, and additional cAMP in urine samples. Basic parameters of all subjects are depicted in . The patient had blunted urinary cAMP response to exogenous PTH (recombinant 1-34) as compared to healthy control and patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism []. However, our patient had normal tubular reabsorption of phosphate and percentage fall in the ratio of maximum rate of renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (TmPO4/GFR) [] when compared to two other subjects, indicating normal phosphaturic response. In view of hypocalcemic tetany with raised PTH levels and blunted nephrogenous response to exogenous PTH, the patient was diagnosed as a case of PHP1b. He was continued with calcium and 1\u03b1-calcidiol. Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?",

The surgery was indicated for management of an ovarian tumour. She had a history of some psychiatric illness a few years back and was on medications, which were later discontinued, but details of the same could not be obtained owing to poor documentation. During location of the epidural space, the initial attempt resulted in a dural puncture, following which the epidural space was located at the immediate upper spinous interspace and anaesthesia proceeded uneventfully with endotracheal intubation. She was extubated on table, Inj morphine 3 mg administered through the epidural catheter for relief of postoperative pain, and was shifted to the postoperative ward without any major concerns.\nFive hours later, she was found catatonic in bed with total loss of limb movements. Plantars were flexor and pupils normal. Eyes were half-open, mouth slightly open and the patient held this posture ignoring any verbal contact or external stimulus. She was actively resisting eyelid elevation and blinking in response to visual threat. The patient was haemodynamically stable and arterial blood gases (ABG), serum electrolytes, and blood glucose levels were unremarkable. In view of the previous dural puncture, egress of the epidurally administered morphine into the intrathecal space was considered and naloxone administered to antagonize its effects. In about an hour, the patient was fully conscious, oriented, and responding to oral commands. However, the patient was not vocalizing and was still keeping her mouth slightly open. Upon being instructed to close her mouth, the patient indicated that she was unable to do so and TMJ dislocation was considered. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon was called to do a reduction of the TMJ.

    "question": "Our patient was a 15-year-old female resident in Inner Mongolia. She started to develop intermittent claudication 1 year prior to admission. She was also noted to have low-grade fever of 37.5\u00b0C, bilateral rash over her lower limbs, and apparent hair loss. Local hospital made the diagnosis of Erythema Nodosum and prescribed unclear regimen of thymosin and traditional Chinese medicine to treat the disease. Although the fever and rash resolved slowly, the claudication kept worsening gradually. One month ago, she could only climb up two floors and complained of decreased appetite, intermittent emesis, coughing white frothy sputum, and pitting oedema of lower limbs and eyelids. One week ago, she suddenly developed shortness of breath and hemoptysis. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple infiltrates, ground-glass opacities, budding signs, and bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac ultrasound revealed diffuse biventricular hypokinesia, left ventricular thrombosis, and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (56 mmHg). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 28%. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) was 7 mm. Acute heart failure was diagnosed, and diuresis was initiated. Her discomforts slightly improved, and she was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit in our hospital for further investigation. Past medical history and family history revealed nothing significant.\nOn admission, her height was 163 cm and weight was 57.5 kg. Her body mass index (BMI) was 21.6 kg/m2. Her blood pressure in the upper extremities were 160/110 mmHg (left) and 140/90 mmHg (right). The number could not be interpreted in the lower limbs. Her heart rate was 120 bpm of regular rhythm. Respiration rate was 25 per minute and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur over the right cervical region, asymmetrical radial pulses, and disappearance of both dorsalis pedis artery pulses. Jugular vein distentions, bilateral rales in lung bases, liver enlargement, and pitting oedema of lower limbs were also noted. Blood tests revealed low albumin level of 23 g/L (33\u201352 g/L) and markedly increased BNP of 2009 ng/L (<300 ng/L). Twenty-four-hour urine albumin was 5.2 g with G/P 100% while antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were normal. The 12-lead electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, left atrial overloading, and left ventricle enlargement. Echocardiography revealed multiple abnormalities: (i) enlargement of the entire heart, with left atrium diameter of 41 mm and left ventricular end diastolic diameter of 53 mm; (ii) mural thrombus of both ventricles. Two were in the left while one was in the right; (iii) diffuse hypokinesis of left ventricle and severe impairment of both ventricle's systolic and diastolic functions. The estimated LVEF was 12%; (iv) moderate pulmonary hypertension of 49 mmHg; (v) small amount of pericardial effusion (Figure\n). Vascular ultrasounds detected multiple arterial stenosis, including right cephalic artery, common femoral arteries, and superficial femoral arteries. Thickening of the femoral arterial walls was also noted.\nRheumatology, pulmonology, and infectious diseases were consulted, and the following diagnoses were made: (i) acute decompensated heart failure; (ii) Takayasu arteritis. Our patient met four out of five diagnostic criteria of TA (age < 40 years old, symptoms of limb ischaemia, physical findings of decreased pulses, and unsymmetrical blood pressure, evidence of arterial stenosis provided by imaging); (iii) multiple ventricular thrombosis; (iv) pulmonary tuberculosis. This preliminary diagnosis was based on multiple infiltrates of her lungs and high incidence of tuberculosis in TA patients. Continuous intravenous nitroglycerin infusion, vigorous furosemide boluses, and oral beta blockers were administered to counter heart failure while low molecular weight heparin was injected subcutaneously for anticoagulation. Intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg daily and cyclophosphamide 400 mg weekly were tailored to treat TA while an anti-tuberculosis regimen of oral isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was initiated at the same time. One week later, her symptoms began to resolve. Serum BNP and urine albumin excretion level gradually decreased while her ESR level raised up to 96 mm/h (<20 mm/h). After two weeks, repeated echocardiography showed her heart's dimensions returned to normal with LVEF 41%. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected small patches of delayed enhancement in myocardium of the ventricular septum and left ventricular inferior wall (Figure\n). Both coronary arterial angiograms and Technetium sestamibi (99mTc-MIBI) static myocardial perfusion imaging were negative. Thoracic CT found her left lobe had greatly improved while multiple infiltrates and patches remained in the right lobe. Pulmonary embolism was suspected, and CT pulmonary angiogram found multiple emboli in the right pulmonary artery (Figure\n). We gradually transitioned from low molecular weight heparin to warfarin and switched from intravenous methylprednisolone to oral prednisone before discharge. At her 2 month follow-up, we discontinued the warfarin as both echocardiography and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) showed the complete dissolve of the thrombus. Both the morphology and function of her heart were normal. Her pulmonary lesions disappeared at her 4 month follow-up, and she remained on her steroid and anti-tuberculosis regime.

An intravenous infusion was initiated to maintain water-electrolyte balance and provide antibiotic treatment with cefoperazone/sulbactam and moxifloxacin. The patient also received daily intravenous infusions of 200 mg methylprednisolone as pulse therapy. Considering the large area of the burn and the long time during which monochloroacetic acid was absorbed, bedside continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) was applied every other day to rapidly remove acid from the circulation and prevent acute renal failure. Patient\u2019s lethargy gradually improved, and the level of consciousness returned to normal on the third day of treatment. The wound dressing was changed daily, and the patient did not have severe acidosis, oliguria, or anuria. However, he developed a cough with purulent yellow sputum and his temperature rose to 38.8 \u00b0C but dropped to normal after the administration of antibiotics. Six days after the admission (on 24 October), the patient\u2019s condition was relatively stable, and laboratory tests improved (). Wheezing, coughing, and expectoration continued, however. shows the head, abdomen, and chest scan () revealed cerebellar infarction, a few ischemic degeneration foci in the brain, a few inflammation areas in both lungs, fibrous foci, a small amount of effusion in bilateral pleural cavity, and adjacent pulmonary tissue swelling, indicating monochloroacetic acid aspiration pneumonia. The patient therefore continued to receive antibiotics and started a regular terbutaline atomisation therapy to help expel the phlegm, and the patient was encouraged to cough out the sputum.\nThe patient remained stable until 5 November (see blood test findings in ). Methylprednisolone was discontinued and replaced with oral prednisone, which was gradually reduced. Given the stable condition of the patient, the burn department was contacted to arrange skin grafting. The patient was diagnosed with a 10 % third-degree burn. On 18 November, he underwent debridement and negative pressure suction of the upper limbs and left chest wall under general anaesthesia. Granulation and stale tissue on the wound surface were removed. Skin grafting was performed under general anaesthesia by rinsing the wound with hydrogen peroxide and sterile saline, and implanting the patient\u2019s left anterior thigh full-thickness flap into the left upper limb and the left side of the chest wall. The wound healed perfectly (), and the patient was discharged on 4 December 2019. The results of the tests performed during a follow-up visit on 29 April 2020 were within the normal range.

    "question": "An 18-year-old man (175 cm, 81 kg) with right hemifacial microsomia was scheduled for double-jaw surgery, correction with distraction osteogenesis, and mandibular anglectomy. Although he had no underlying medical history, he had undergone correction with distraction osteogenesis in 2006. At that time, the patient was classified as Cormack-Lehane grade 4, and oral intubation was performed with FOB. The patient reported a history of sleep apnea and heavy snoring, during the preoperative interview. His mouth opening was about 2.5-finger-breadth and neck extension was normal, during the preoperative physical examination. However, he had severe retrognathia and a class III Mallampati score. The thyromental distance was less than 6 cm. Moreover, an oral panoramic view X-ray showed narrowing of the nasopharyngeal airway, due to severe retrognathia (). According to El-Anwar et al. [], the mean depth (anteroposterior diameter) of the nasopharynx in normal adults is 21.8 \u00b1 4.6 mm. However, the depth of nasopharynx in our patient was 15.5 mm, which was narrower than usual. We explained the possibility of a difficult airway and informed the patient about the special risks and procedures pertaining to performing an awake intubation procedure. Other preoperative laboratory examinations, chest X-ray, and electrocardiography revealed no abnormalities.\nOn the day of surgery, we prepared a Glidescope\u00ae; LMA, fiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus Optical, Japan); a 0.035-inch-thick, 145-cm-long straight-tipped Angio Guidewire (Lunderquist-ring, Cook Critical Care, ); and a high-flow nasal cannula (Optiflow\u2122). Nasotracheal intubation was required to secure space in the oral cavity for surgery; thus, we prepared nasotracheal tubes of various sizes. Non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS) measurement were performed in the operating room. The monitor showed an initial blood pressure of 140/84 mmHg, a heart rate of 58 beats/min and room air saturation of 98%. Lidocaine 4% was sprayed onto the tongue and oropharynx for topical anesthesia. Sufficient preoxygenation was provided with Optiflow\u2122, at a flow rate of 20 L/min, to achieve an SpO2 of 100%. We started total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with 2% propofol and remifentanil administered at effect-site concentrations of 2.5 \u00b5g/ml and 1.5 ng/ml, respectively, with a target-controlled infusion pump. The SpO2 decreased to 96%, soon after the BIS was 42 and the patient fell asleep, but there was no further desaturation, after we raised the flow rate of Optiflow\u2122 to 40 L/min. Since the left nostril was larger than the right nostril, owing to right-sided hemifacial microsomia, we decided to insert the FOB into the left nostril. After guiding the FOB into the left nostril of the patient, it passed into the trachea through the glottis, without any issue. We inserted the 145-cm-long, straight-tipped Angio Guidewire (Lunderquist-ring, Cook Critical Care) into the working channel of the FOB, till we could visualize the entrance of the guidewire into the carina (). We carefully removed the FOB and the guidewire remained in position. We also used the Glidescope\u00ae to confirm that the guidewire was still within the oral cavity and had passed through the vocal cord, and into the trachea (). The exchange catheter (1.6-mm internal diameter [ID], 2.7-mm outer diameter, CAEC, Cook Critical Care) was inserted over the Angio Guidewire and the Angio Guidewire was pulled out. A nasotracheal tube with 6.5 mm ID was advanced carefully over the exchange catheter into the airway without incidence. After removing the exchange catheter, the tracheal tube cuff was inflated, and proper positioning of the ETT was confirmed by auscultating both lungs and by confirming continuous positive end-tidal CO2. The monitor showed a blood pressure of 133/86 mmHg, heart rate of 95 beats/min, an SpO2 of 97%, and a BIS of 50 after intubation. An oxygenation level of 97% or higher was maintained throughout the procedure. After confirming proper intubation, we adjusted the effect-site concentration of propofol and remifentanil to 4.0 \u00b5g/ml and 2.5 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, and administered 80 mg of rocuronium intravenously. The time required for the administration of intubation to its confirmation was 16 min. The intra and postoperative periods were uneventful.\nAfter the procedure, we provided a full explanation regarding this case report to the patient and obtained permission for the same.

    "question": "A 17-year-old female with no medical history complained of general fatigue and bradycardia from three months before. Her height, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 161 cm, 45 kg, and 17.4 kg/m2, respectively. A physical examination indicated that the blood pressure and heart rate are 87/46 mmHg and 38 beats/min, respectively. Laboratory data indicated an elevation of hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, 21 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 28 IU/L), hypoproteinemia (total protein, 6.1 g/dL; albumin, 3.9 g/dL), hypoglycemia (blood glucose, 67 mg/dL), and a decrease in free triiodothironene (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels (FT3, 0.87 pg/mL; FT4 0.87 ng/dL). Thyroid stimulating hormone (4.610 \u03bcIU/L) was normal. The total blood ketone level was high (114 mmol/L), but the levels of thiamin (2.7 \u03bcg/dL), cobalamin (548 pg/mL), folic acid (4.8 ng/mL), growth hormone (6.17 ng/mL), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (31.3 pg/mL) were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed bradycardia with junctional rhythm and prolonged QT interval (). A cardiac echocardiogram showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 45%) with apical wall motion decline of both ventricles and both ventricles were dilated (LV diastolic dimension: LVDd 52 mm) (). A coronary angiogram showed no stenosis or obstruction, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show late gadolinium enhancement. An endomyocardial biopsy revealed moderate vacuolar degeneration, hypertrophy, and attenuation of the myocardium as well as moderate interstitial fibrosis. Any inflammatory cell infiltrate, myocardial edema, or necrosis was not observed (). The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with sick sinus syndrome at the time.\nAn angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) was prescribed without pacemaker implantation since the fatigue was clearly not related to the bradycardia. During the follow-up, cardiac echocardiographic findings after four months did not improve (LVEF 44%, LVDd 49 mm); her body weight reduced to 34.1 kg (BMI 13.6 kg/m2) after losing 16 kg in six months, and she was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN) by a psychiatrist. The patient received nutritional counseling and appropriate psychotherapy to increase her caloric intake. One month later, her body weight increased to 43.5 kg (BMI 16.8 kg/m2), heart rate (HR) increased to 66 beats/min with sinus rhythm, and LVEF increased to 55%. One year later, her body weight increased to 54 kg (BMI 20.8 kg/m2), HR increased to 70 beats/min, and LVEF rose to 60%.

    "question": "A 60-year-old male (height: 173 cm; weight: 70.9 kg) with a past history of rheumatoid arthritis was transferred to the ICU due to ARDS caused by H1N1 influenza virus infection. In a previous hospital, he was treated for influenza and possible secondary bacterial pneumonia for 18 days. However, oxygenation rapidly deteriorated two days before the transfer with the suspicion of ARDS. After the ICU admission, he was immediately intubated and the mechanical ventilation was started in an A/C mode with a tidal volume of 6.7 mL/kg of predicted body weight, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen 1.0, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths/min, during which blood gas values were as follows: pH 7.35, PaO2 of 103 mmHg, and PaCO2 of 46 mmHg. Chest X-ray and CT showed diffuse bilateral infiltration with normal left ventricular function on cardiac echocardiography (Figure ).\nMurray score was 3.25 (PaO2/FiO2 of 103, X-ray alveolar consolidation confined to 4 quadrants, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, compliance of 37 mL/cmH2O). In view of the deteriorating condition, we decided to start veno-venous ECMO using Cardiohelp (Maquet CP, Hirrlingen, Germany). Cannulation performed was with a 22-Fr cannula (PCKC-V, Toyobo, Japan) for drainage into his right atrium through the right femoral vein and with a 16.5-Fr cannula (CAPIOX EBS, Terumo, Japan) for blood infusion into the right internal jugular vein. The initial settings of ECMO begin at a flow of 42 mL/kg/min, speed of 3,000 rotations/min, fraction of delivered oxygen (FiO2) of 100%, and sweep of 2 L/min. The ventilator was changed to a lung-rest setting (PEEP of 10 cmH2O and pressure control of 8 cmH2O, RR of 15 breaths/min). In addition, he was empirically started on meropenem and azithromycin.\nIn the previous hospital, he was treated with methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day) for two days. Additional methylprednisolone 1,000 mg was used for one day with subsequent steroid dosing (predonine 70 mg/day) in our hospital. The treatment of steroid pulse was performed because of suspected autoimmune disease or drug-induced pneumonia by methotrexate treatment. However, his blood test was finally negative for all autoimmune antibodies. Moreover, all bacteria and virus tests were negative. Therefore, the deteriorated patient\u2019s oxygenation was considered to be suggestive of ARDS caused by influenza infection.\nThe multidisciplinary mobilization team with a physical therapist, nurse, medical engineer, and doctor evaluated the patient\u2019s status and developed a daily plan of rehabilitation based on progressive mobilization protocol. On day 2, rehabilitation was limited to a passive range of motion due to the low conscious level (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS] score: \u22122 to \u22124). Active mobilization was started from day 3 with patient consciousness alert (RASS score: \u22121 to 0). The patient was mobilized with sitting on the edge of bed and standing.\nOn day 4, mobilization level was elevated to standing two times in a day. On day 5, foot stepping was added to standing. On day 6 after the separation from ECMO, the patient was transferred from the bed to the chair with minimum assistance. On day 7 after extubation, the patient was ambulated in the ICU. Nutrition was started from day 2, and the intake protein increased to 1.3 g/kg on day 4 with calorie suppressed to 17.6 kcal/kg (Peptamen Intense\u00ae, Nestl\u00e9, Vevey, Switzerland). During mobilization in the ICU, the patient did not experience any hemodynamic, ventilatory, or cannulation trouble.\nBy using ultrasound, muscle mass was measured three times, and the median value was recorded for evaluation. Experienced examiner (N.N.) conducted the measurement with previously reported intra- and inter-observer reproducibilities [,]. The Rectus femoris cross-sectional area was measured between the anterosuperior iliac spine and the proximal end of the patella []. Diaphragm thickness was also measured by the ultrasound from the zone of apposition []. During the seven days of admission, the rectus femoris muscle mass decreased by 5.3%, 10.8%, and 13.0% on days 3, 5, and 7, respectively, compared with the ICU admission value (Figure ).\nDiaphragm thickness remained unchanged (1.8 cm from day 1 through day 5) during five days of mechanical ventilation. The urinary titin, corrected with urinary creatinine, was measured using ELISA kit (27900 Titin N-Fragment Assay Kit, Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Gunma, Japan) to evaluate catabolism. Urinary titin level was much higher than the normal range (normal range: 1-3 pmol/mg Cr, urinary titin level in this patient: 24.1, 32.8, 38.0, 31.5, 38.4 pmol/mg Cr on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, respectively), indicating ongoing catabolism. Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine (BUN/Cr) was also elevated to 34.6-63.6 (normal range: 10-20). In spite of the catabolism, the Medical Research Council (MRC) score was maintained at 59, 60, 58, and 60 on days 2, 3, 5, and 7, respectively. Furthermore, the patient did not experience ICU-acquired weakness [].\nDuring ECMO, the patient\u2019s tidal volume was reduced to 4.0-4.6 mL/kg, with peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. His lung condition gradually improved. The bilateral infiltration of the X-ray was clearly disappearing. On day 4, oxygenation had significantly improved to PaO2/FiO2 of 183. On day 5, he was completely separated from ECMO. On day 6, he was liberated from mechanical ventilation. On day 7, he was discharged from the ICU. The functional status score for the ICU (FSS-ICU) was 31 out of 35 at discharge from the ICU.\nOn day 8, he was transferred to a ward with a Barthel index (BI) of 95 (stairs: need help). The six-minute walk test was 260 m (45% of normal value) on day 10 and 395 m (69%) on day 24 []. On day 22, chest X-ray showed normal lung fields (Figure ).\nAfter steroid tapering in a ward, he was discharged directly home with a BI of 100 on day 27.

    "question": "In 2005, a 30-year-old woman was admitted to the Department of Endocrinology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland, with uncontrolled hypertension and obesity. On physical examination at admission, the patient was 163-cm tall and weighed 87 kg, with a body mass index (BMI) of 33 kg/m2. The mean arterial pressure in daily measurements was 140/105 mmHg. In the clinical examination, Cushing syndrome was suspected. In the hormonal evaluation, elevated cortisol concentration with the normal circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion was found.\nNevertheless, in a dexamethasone suppression test, the patient presented an elevated cortisol concentration after administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (). Serum and diurnal urine concentration of Na, K, Ca, and phosphates were normal. The serum glucose profile is presented in .\nAmong the complications of hypertension, the patient revealed a hypertensive retinopathy of stage I/II.\nWe also performed dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry: T-score at L1\u2013L4 lumbar spine was \u22121.57, and the patient was diagnosed with osteopenia.\nDue to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent hypercortisolemia, we performed diagnostic imaging; an adrenal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of moderately enlarged left gland presenting homogeneous absorption with no focal changes, whereas the right adrenal gland appeared normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not confirm any lesions in the pituitary gland. The biological and radiological data were highly suggestive of ACTH-independent Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Surgical removal of the left adrenal gland was performed. Histopathology results showed micronodular adrenal hyperplasia. The patient was prescribed indapamide 1.5 mg once daily and perindopril 5 mg once daily. Moreover, sodium and potassium, calcium, and vitamin D3 supplementation were prescribed.\nDespite surgical treatment, in 2010, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to recurrent uncontrolled hypertension. Her BMI was 35.8 kg/m\u00b2, and mean arterial pressure in daily measurements was 155/120 mmHg. Skin hyperpigmentation was observed. The hormonal profile is presented in and the patient\u2019s blood glucose level before treatment in 2010 is presented in .\nAdrenal angiography did not show any focal changes. MRI of the sella region was therefore performed, revealing a hypointense pituitary tumor of 5 mm in diameter located in the left anterior pituitary lobe. These MRI findings were highly suggestive of pituitary microadenoma.\nTrans-sphenoidal total resection of the pituitary tumor was performed. Upon immunohistochemical examination, the resected pituitary microadenoma cells exhibited positive staining for the ACTH antibody. The patient was prescribed perindopril 5 mg once daily, losartan 50 mg once daily, spironolactone 50 mg once daily, bisoprolol 5 mg once daily, indapamide 1.5 mg once daily, acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg once daily, desmopressin 0.1 mg twice daily, and hydrocortisone 20 mg\u201310 mg\u20130 mg daily.\nSubsequently, in 2011, the patient was admitted to the Department of Surgery for a scheduled strumectomy due to multinodular struma, which had been diagnosed in 2010. During the physical examination, an enlarged and fibroelastic thyroid was identified. The serum concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) were normal, indicating euthyreosis. The hormonal profile is presented in .\nUltrasound imaging demonstrated multiple nodules in both thyroid lobes, with the biggest solid nodule with calcification and hypoechoic outline measuring 1.17 \u00d7 1.82 cm.\nThe patient underwent a total strumectomy. Histological sections from the left lobe showed features of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The lesion was 1 cm in diameter with hyaline-fibrous capsule and calcification inside. Histopathology also revealed a multinodular struma of the right lobe. The patient was prescribed levothyroxine 100 \u00b5g (1 \u00d7 1), and she was qualified for iodine treatment.\nIn 2018, the patient was admitted to the Department of Gynecological Endocrinology Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland, due to irregular menstrual cycle.\nIn the transvaginal ultrasonography, multiple small uterine fibroids were revealed. The endometrial thickness was 7 mm. The right ovary was enlarged by a cystic-solid, unilocular tumor with a size of 97 mm \u00d7 69 mm with central blood flow. There were no abnormalities in the left ovary revealed in the ultrasound examination.\nAdditionally, a hormonal analysis was performed ().\nDue to ultrasound features and elevated Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) results, the patient was qualified for surgical treatment. Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and retroperitoneal tumor excision were performed. Histopathology results have shown uterine glandular polyp (0.5 cm), serous superficial papillomas and superficial endometriosis in both ovaries, and female adnexal tumor of probable Wolffian origin (FATWO) located in the broad ligament of the uterus. The FATWO was 8 cm in diameter, contained a variable admixture of diffuse, solid, and sieve-like cystic areas filled with blood. Macroscopically, the tumor was soft and uncapsulated. Immunohistochemical examination revealed an interesting profile of this tumor: ER(+), PgR(+), AR(+), GATA3(+), calretinin(+), HBME(+), WT1(+), cytokeratins AE1/AE3(+), CK7(+), CKAE 1/3 (+), melan A(+), \u03b1-inhibin(+), CD99 (+), CEA mono(\u2212), PAX8(\u2212), TTF1(\u2212), RCC(\u2212), CK20(\u2212), CD117(\u2212), S100(\u2212), EMA(\u2212), HMB45(\u2212), and Ki67 (5%).\nDue to a history of multiglandular diseases: micronodular adrenal hyperplasia, pituitary adenoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and ovarian tumor, the patient was referred to genetic testing for mutations associated with multiple gland malignancy. We performed an analysis of 83 genes deletion/duplication (Invitae Multi Cancer Panel) in the whole blood sample. The Invitae Multi-Cancer Panel analyzes 83 genes associated with hereditary cancers across major organ systems, including: breast and gynecologic (breast, ovarian, uterine); gastrointestinal (colorectal, gastric, pancreatic); endocrine (thyroid, paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma, parathyroid, pituitary); genitourinary (renal/urinary tract, prostate); skin (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma); brain/nervous system sarcoma and hematologic (myelodysplastic syndrome/leukemia) cancers: AIP; ALK; APC; ATM; AXIN2; BAP1; BARD1; BLM; BMPR1A; BRCA1; BRCA2; BRIP1; CASR; CDC73; CDH1; CDK4; CDKN1B; CDKN1C; CDKN2A; CEBPA; CHEK2; CTNNA1; DICER1; DIS3L2; EGFR; EPCAM; FH; FLCN; GATA2; GPC3; GREM1; HOXB13; HRAS; KIT; MAX; MEN1; MET; MITF; MLH1; MSH2; MSH3; MSH6; MUTYH; NBN; NF1; NF2; NTHL1; PALB2; PDGFRA; PHOX2B; PMS2; POLD1; POLE; POT1; PRKAR1A; PTCH1; PTEN; RAD50; RAD51C; RAD51D; RB1; RECQL4; RET; RUNX1; SDHA; SDHAF2; SDHB; SDHC; SDHD; SMAD4; SMARCA4; SMARCB1; SMARCE1; STK11; SUFU; TERC; TERT; TMEM127; TP53; TSC1; TSC2; VHL; WRN; and WT1 gene mutations.

    "question": "A 46-year-old Japanese man with a history of distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer visited our hospital on November 2011, because he wanted a more adequate dose of HD than the dialysis schedule (four hours twice a week) he was receiving at his facility at that time. The primary cause of his renal failure was ADPKD, and he started HD in October 2009. His dialysis schedule was 3 h twice a week until October 2011, when he suffered palpitations and shortness of breath due to congestive heart failure. His mother and young sister suffered from end-stage renal disease due to ADPKD. His height and weight were 175 cm and 72.1 kg, respectively, at the first visit to our hospital. His blood pressure was 201/122 mmHg. On physical examination, he had severe leg edema. Chest radiography revealed a high cardiothoracic ratio (55.9%), and his electrocardiogram showed no remarkable change. Extracellular fluid was gradually removed by ultrafiltration during his 5-h thrice weekly HD just after he started dialysis at our hospital on November 9, 2011. He subsequently recovered from this volume overload state. Four months after starting treatment, he became normotensive and had a lower cardiothoracic ratio.\nHe suffered from high fever and abdominal pain with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) 27.29 mg/dL soon after he started dialysis at our hospital. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an infected renal cyst with higher intensity on T1-weighted image (T1WI), T2-weighted image (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted image (DWI) compared with normal cysts, and that had a fluid\u2013fluid level (Fig. ). The type of causative organism was not confirmed, because blood cultures obtained from him were negative. He was administered meropenem hydrate for 9 days followed by ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CPFX) for 7 days on admission. He needed to receive CPFX for about 3 months after he was discharged from the hospital because of fever and abdominal pain with moderate serum CRP levels. The frequency of cyst infection episodes with fever, abdominal pain, and moderate serum CRP level were 10.0 days a month during his conventional HD period (November 2011 to April 2012). Following the initiation of 8-h thrice weekly nocturnal HD on May 2012 and until December 2019, the frequency of cyst infection episodes decreased to 1.5 days a month. Moreover, he attained a decrease and stabilization in levels of inflammatory markers and an improvement and maintenance of nutritional status compared with the conventional HD period (Fig. A, B).

    "question": "A 70-year-old male (170 cm, 59 kg) was admitted for a cystic mass (10.4 \u00d7 7.9 \u00d7 7.6 cm) of the liver and decided to undergo right hepatectomy. The patient had a medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Pre-operative transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 44% and severe hypokinesia of the left ventricle. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated a restrictive ventilation defect. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed pleural effusion and consolidation in the right lower lobe (). Laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin, 12.9 g/dl, white blood cell, 7,100 /\u03bcl, platelet, 339,000 /\u03bcl, C-reactive protein, 11.1 mg/dl.\nThe patient\u2019s vital signs were stable prior to general anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with 50 mg of propofol and rocuronium 50 mg and maintained with 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/ min of remifentanil and 5 vol% of desflurane. Tidal volume and respiration rate were set to 400 ml and 13 times/min, espectively. Positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O was applied, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) was 20 cmH2O.\nAt four hours after the beginning of the operation, PIP abruptly increased to 32 cmH2O and a large amount of serous fluid was regurgitated through the endotracheal tube (ETT) (Figs. and ). However, hypoxia did not occur at FiO2 0.5. PaO2 and PaCO2 were within normal range and oxygen saturation was 100% during the entire intra-operative period. The endotracheal tube was exchanged for a 35 Fr left doublelumen endotracheal tube (DLT) and tracheal suction was performed continuously. Approximately 1,000 ml of yellowish fluid was regurgitated through the right side lumen of the DLT within 30 min. Right-sided thoracostomy was performed following hepatectomy, and 300 ml of pleural effusion was drained through the chest tube. Air leakage was observed through the chest tube during positive pressure ventilation. We could not detect and localize abnormal lesion with bronchoscopy. Any gross defect of diaphragm was not observed at operation field. The oxygen saturation of the patient had been consistently maintained at 100%.\nTotal operation time was 7 h and estimated blood loss was about 9,000 ml. Nine liters of crystalloid fluid, 550 ml of colloid fluid, 5 units of packed red blood cells and 10 units of fresh frozen plasma were infused. Urine output during the operation was 790 ml. Post-operational hemoglobin level decreased to 9.1 g/dl after the operation.\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with intubated state. Laboratory findings of the drained fluid from chest tube and the DLT revealed that it was parapneumonic exudate (pH 7.12, glucose 37 mg/dl, protein 3.31 g/ dl, albumin 1.63 g/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 346 IU/L, cholesterol 18.2 mg/dl). The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with pleural drainage and antibiotics. The volume of fluid drained through the ETT and the chest tube gradually decreased. The patient was extubated on postoperative day 5 and discharged from the ICU (). Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?",

    "question": "A 46-year-old man who served as a government official first visited our hospital with complaints of 8-month history of involuntary movements during sleep time, and 3- month history of slow response and walking unsteady. He had begun feeling depressed without a known cause 8 months ago. At almost the same time, he had started to engage in involuntary movement such as kicks and grasps during nighttime sleep, with snoring and sleep apnea. He took diazepam tablets, but it did not work. Afterwards, he noticed excessive sweating and felt hot and cold waves. His maximum body temperature was 37.2\u00b0C; after he used nimesulide, the temperature dropped to 35.0\u00b0C and was subsequently increased, with difficulty. Moreover, he got terrible constipation at that point. He visited mental health centers and was diagnosed with \u201cmild depression\u201d without auxiliary examinations or treatment 4 months ago. About 3 months ago, his family noticed that he had lost approximately 20 kg in weight, choked when drinking, and exhibited slow response, visual hallucinations, and walking unsteady. He got frequent drops from bed during sleeping due to his substantial actions; meanwhile, gasping breath and sleep apnea fragmented his sleep. Eventually, he spoke seldom and seemed to be blunt with shuffling gait.\nThe patient did not have any relevant medical history. He denied having history of trauma, prior blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, and alcohol abuse (Table ).\nThe patient was the fourth individual in his large family to exhibit the same clinical manifestations. The other 3 members all died within a year after onset (Fig. , pedigree chart).\nEight months after the onset, he was taken to our hospital by his families. We did series of tests at that time.\nThe middle-aged man appeared dull. During check-up, he fell into \u201csleep\u201d easily and soon was awakened in horror by his involuntary sleep movements or snoring. The skin and general examination were normal. Temperature: 36.5\u00b0C, respiratory rate 20/min, Blood pressure (lying): 165/109, Pulse: 115. Blood pressure (standing): 150/100 mm Hg, Pulse: 110. Weight: 77 kg. Height: 178 cm.\nHe exhibited severe cognitive impairments, particularly with respect to orientation, attention, calculation power, delayed memory, and visuospatial dysfunction (his Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were 15/30 and 9/30, respectively).\nHe had slurred speech and dysarthria\nCranial nerves (CNs) I-VIII and XI-XII revealed no deficits. CN IX and X showed slowness of bilateral gag reflex, and limited symmetrical elevation of soft palate to phonation.\nMuscle tone was normal. Muscle strength was 5/5 for all groups tested. Spontaneous and evoked myoclonus was evident.\nBilateral biceps reflex and bilateral triceps reflex were 3/4, and bilateral patellar reflex and bilateral Achilles reflex were 4/4. Hoffman sign and Babinski sign were absent. Frontal lobe signs palmomental and grasp were not elicited.\nTouch, pin, vibratory, and proprioception sensations were normal. Romberg test was negative.\nCoordination was inaccurate for finger/nose testing and heel/knee/shin testing; rapid alternating movements were clumsy.\nArm swing was absent. There was bradykinesia and postural instability. Rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia (dysarthria and gait instability), and myoclonus were typical signs in prion diseases.\nTemperature monitoring revealed that the patient's body temperature fluctuated from 36.0\u00b0C to 37.8\u00b0C, and the loss of circadian rhythm was observed. Blood pressure monitoring indicated a steady high blood pressure of approximately 150/100 mm Hg and the loss of dipper-type blood pressure rhythm, with a heart rate that fluctuated approximately 100 beats per minute. A dynamic electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with the incidental discovery of multifocal ventricular premature beat.\nBlood examinations such as blood routine, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolytes, myocardial enzyme, blood ammonia, homocysteine, folic acid, VitB12, microelement (calcium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lithium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, lead, thallium, zinc), thyroid function and antibodies, rheumatism biomarker, infection-related antibodies (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV), and tumor marker showed normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination (intracranial pressure was 200 mmH2O, cell number 1, glucose, chloride, protein, acetic acid, IgA, IgM, IgG, Oligoclonal bands, PCR for JC virus, EB virus, HSV-I virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) appeared normal and 14\u20133\u20133 protein was negative. Autoimmune encephalopathy related antibodies (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor, contactin-associated protein 2, \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 1 receptor, \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 2 receptor, leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1, gamma-aminobutyric acid B), and paraneoplastic syndrome related antibodies (CV2/CRMP5, PNMA2, RI, Yo, Hu, Amphiphysin) in blood and CSF were all detected, but none of them indicates abnormity. Routine urinalysis and fecal analysis were normal. Hormone secretion detection demonstrated the abnormal secrete rhythmicity of prolactin and growth hormone.\nExtensive \u03b8 activity and scattered slow waves are recorded in an electroencephalogram (EEG). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed atrophy of the frontal and temporal. Polysomnogram (PSG) demonstrated the patient's obvious deprivation of total sleep time; neither spindle nor slow wave sleep was detected during his \u201cfragmented sleep,\u201d even when he showed snoring, mentalis relaxation, sleep apnea, and hyoxemia (Fig. ).\nThe nucleotides from 12742 to 13318 (GenBank accessionnumber U2918) of exon I in PRNP were amplified; then, polymerase chain reaction products were directly sequenced on an ABI 377 automatic sequencer. The results were analyzed using DNA Sequencing Analysis Software version 3.4.1 (Gene Codes Corp, Ann Arbor, Michigan). Genetic analysis found that the patient harbored a D178N/129M haplotype mutation in PRNP (a GAC\u2192AAC homozygous mutation at codon 178 and a methionine polymorphism at codon 129).\nThe patient had been diagnosed with FFI and received treatment with drugs to improve brain metabolism, such as idebenone, ganglioside, and coenzyme Q10. During the follow-up by telephone, his wife told us that he got once improvement in his responsiveness soon after discharge; however, sudden death occurred 3 months later. The total disease course was 11 months.\nThe patient information involved in our manuscript has been obtained and informed consent was obtained from his legal representatives. All human studies have been approved by the appropriate ethics committee and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.

    "question": "A developmentally appropriate and previously healthy 15-year-old girl presented to the Emergency Department with a 4-day history of severe and persistent headache associated with a 1-day history of photophobia, altered mentality, and gait disturbance. No recent contributing history was noticed. She was afebrile but had tachycardia (111 beats/min) and hypertension (146/78 mmHg). She was 160 cm tall and weighed 51 kg. The initial neurologic examination revealed lethargic mentality with emotional lability, dysarthria, and an ataxic gait without lower-extremity weakness; however, no focal neurologic deficits or meningismus-related signs were apparent. She had no palpable lymphadenopathy or rash.\nThe initial work-up showed normal complete blood count, electrolyte, and chemistry panel, and thyroid function test findings. Pregnancy testing was negative. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed unremarkable results. Lumbar puncture revealed significant lymphocytic pleocytosis (WBC, 114/mm3; 86% lymphocytes); normal protein (21 mg/dL) and glucose (64 mg/dL) levels; and normal opening pressure. CSF meningitis and encephalitis panels were negative for multiple bacterial, viral, and fugal antigens, including herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, varicella zoster virus, and Cryptococcus. Systemic infectious and rheumatologic evaluations were also negative. Pelvic computed tomography of a palpable mass found on an abdominal exam revealed a large cystic mass with a complex component (3.8 cm\u00d74.9 cm\u00d73.6 cm) in her right ovary, which was most likely a dermoid cyst or teratoma (). She underwent surgical resection of the ovarian tumor. Twenty-four-hour video/EEG monitoring revealed continuous diffuse background slowing and extreme delta brushes (), suggesting diffuse encephalopathy related to anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. No AED was administered. The antibody and NMDAR test results were positive in the CSF (1:40 titer) but negative in the serum. Anti-voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC), anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), antiperoxidase, antithyroglobulin, and paraneoplastic antibodies tested negative in the CSF and serum.\nThe patient was administered high-dose intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg daily for 5 days and IV immunoglobulin G (IVIG) 400 mg/kg daily for 5 days. Her aggressive activity, ataxic gait, and dysarthria symptoms continued to wax and wane since the first-line immune therapy. No significant improvement was observed on video/EEG monitoring. She was treated with IV rituximab (a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, 375 mg/m2/wk) as the second-line immune therapy. Her neurological symptoms and behavioral abnormalities improved significantly after IV rituximab therapy, while repeat MRI showed negative results; repeat CSF examination showed decreased anti-NMDAR antibody titer (1:20). Video/EEG findings became normal. She had no significant complications such as a serious infection or viral reactivation during the rituximab treatment. Final pathology of the ovarian mass showed a right cystic teratoma. She was discharged on day 19 with significant improvement in neurologic status and planned to continue active rehabilitation treatment. Presently, she is no longer taking antihypertensive drugs. At the 12-month follow-up, she reported continued improvement in her neurologic symptoms and a stable mood.

    "question": "A 66-year-old male weighting 72 kg, with a height of 170 cm, was admitted to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) after a laparotomic duodeno-cefalo-pancreasectomy. His comorbidities included hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease and a history of deep vein thrombosis. His medications included fondaparinux (discontinued 24 h before surgery), atenolol and pantoprazole.\nThe anaesthesiologist planned an endovenous analgesia strategy. The positioning of an epidural catheter was considered an unacceptable risk due to the short discontinuation time of the fondaparinux.\nThe surgery was uneventful and the patient was extubated in the operating room. The analgesia was administered as follows: acetaminophen 1 g 8 hourly, ketoprofen 100 mg 6 hourly and tramadol 100 mg 6 hourly.\nHowever, the patient complained of a pain described as \u2018sharp\u2019 during the first postoperative day. The pain intensity was evaluated with the numeric rating scale (NRS) and ranged from 8 to 10. The analgesic rescue therapy consisted of morphine boluses (total 30 mg); however the patient reported more nausea than pain relief after the administration of each bolus.\nIn order to provide analgesia we decided to execute a bilateral ESP block at T9 level. An informed consent for anaesthesia was obtained.\nThe ESP block was performed as described by Forero: the patient was placed in the semi-recumbent position and a high-frequency linear ultrasound transducer was placed transversally on the spinous process of the T9 vertebra. Afterwards, with a lateral movement of the probe, the transverse process was visualized and centred. The erector spinae muscle was identified by performing a 90\u00b0 rotation of the probe on the deep plane. The ESP block was executed by injecting 20 ml of 2% ropivacaine. In the following 30 min the patient reported a satisfying analgesia (NRS 3). The patient requested further analgesics after 18 h of the block execution.

    "question": "A 28-year-old Japanese woman had infertility, with G5 P1, but not antiphospholipid syndrome. Owing to protein S deficiency, she was treated with aspirin 100 mg per day and heparin therapy, which was discontinued because of a subchorionic hematoma at 12 weeks of gestation. At 16 weeks, she presented with proteinuria and edema in the lower extremities and was transferred to another hospital. A high dose of oral glucocorticoids (prednisolone, 40 mg) was initiated for presumed primary glomerulonephritis before 20 weeks of gestation with severe hypoalbuminemia (1.8 g/dL) and severe proteinuria (10 g/gCre) were suspected. In addition, 40 mg of nifedipine per day and 750 mg of methyldopa hydrate per day were administered for hypertension. Her condition failed to improve, and bilateral pleural effusion appeared. Therefore, she was transferred to our hospital at 21 weeks and 3 days of gestation.\nHer medical history was unremarkable, except for infertility. Her birthweight was within the normal range (3260 g). Her height was 156 cm, blood pressure was not high at 128/91 mmHg, and she weighed 53.3 kg. She had remarkable edema in her lower extremities. She did not have sclerodactyly. Laboratory test results were as follows. Serum total protein and albumin levels were very low at 4.9 and 2.2 g/dL, respectively. Serum creatinine and uric acid were slightly high at 0.65 and 6.9 mg/dL, respectively, owing to her gestation. Serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were 510, 329, and 439 mg/dL, respectively. C-reactive protein was 0.37 mg/dL, and urine protein content was 5.6 g/day, with no hematuria. Antinuclear antibody was low titer (1:40), and anti-centromere antibody was positive at 29.3 IU/mL. In addition, anti-dsDNA, anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein I antibody, and anti-phospholipid IgG antibody, lupus anticoagulant were negative. Serum IgG, IgA, C3, and C4 levels were 131, 85, 64, and 10 mg/dL, respectively. Serum IgM and IgE levels were 139 and 133 mg/dL, respectively. Further, protein S activity was in the normal range (95%) in our hospital.\nShe met the criteria for nephrotic syndrome. However, it was difficult to diagnose primary nephrotic syndrome due to PE before 20 weeks without kidney biopsy. Therefore, we examined serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) levels since the ratio of sFlt-1/PlGF (> 36) in pregnant women have been demonstrated as a predictor of PE []. The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio turned out to be very high (sFlt-1, 13,400 pg/mL; PlGF, 21.9 pg/mL; serum sFlt-1/PlGF ratio 611.9), so that we diagnosed her nephrotic syndrome because of PE, and we discontinued oral glucocorticoids. We used furosemide and human albumin solution, however, her fetal growth curve was lower than 2 standard deviation after 21 weeks (Fig. ) and, further, she had a reflux of uterine artery blood flow. Therefore, she had a cesarean section at 24 weeks 3 days. Five weeks after delivery, we performed a kidney biopsy. The core kidney tissue contained 21 glomeruli without global sclerosis. Two of the 21 glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerotic lesions, with epithelial cell hyperplasia and foam cells in the tubular poles (Fig. a, b). In addition, spike formations and bubbly appearances of the glomerular basement membrane were absent (Fig. c). In addition, hyaline arteriolosclerosis and intimal thickening in the interlobular arteries were not found (Fig. d).\nImmunofluorescence (IF) staining demonstrated diffuse, linear, peripheral patterns of C4d, slight paramesangial patterns of IgM and negative results for IgG, IgA, C3, and C1q. Electron microscopy revealed diffuse subendothelial edema without electron-dense deposits. Further, diffuse foot process effacement was not observed (Fig. ). The histological diagnosis was severe glomerular endotheliosis with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) lesions. For the histology of the placenta, hemorrhagic infarction around the umbilical cord and syncytial knots were consistent with PE (Fig. ). As shown in her whole clinical course (Fig. ), 8 months after delivery, her proteinuria disappeared completely without anti-hypertensive agents, which was also compatible with PE. The neonate was diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome, rickets, and retinopathy. His weight increased from 303 g to 2806 g 171 days after birth.

    "question": "A 46-year-old Korean woman presented with a 1-month history of progressive generalized edema since November, 2020. She had a history of malignant melanoma on the left posterior side of the thigh that was treated with wide local excision on May 29, 2019. Because of metastasis to the left sentinel and inguinal lymph nodes, she received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 21 days for 1 year, from July 10, 2019 to July 3, 2020. During pemblizumab treatment, she was started on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, presumably an immune-related AE of pembrolizumab. Four months after the cessation of pembrolizumab, she developed generalized edema, most notable in the periorbital area and both hands and legs, which gradually worsened. She denied taking any new medication or personal and family history of kidney disease. Her baseline observations on admission were as follows: height, 165 cm; weight, 70 kg; blood pressure, 140/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 74 bpm and regular; and temperature, 36.4\u00b0C. Clinical examination revealed grade 3 pitting edema in both lower legs. Four months before the onset of the edema, her blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, body weight was 65 kg, and body mass index was 23.88 kg/m2. Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 10,940/\u03bcL (reference range 3800\u201311,000/\u03bcL); hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL (reference range 11.2\u201315.0 g/dL); platelet count 208 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL (reference range 140\u2013420 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL); total protein 5.71 g/dL (reference range 6.0\u20138.0 g/dL); albumin 2.84 g/dL (reference range 3.3\u20135.2 g/dL); blood urea nitrogen 5.4 mg/dL (reference range 6\u201326 mg/dL); creatinine 0.66 mg/dL (reference range 0.4\u20131.2 mg/dL); estimated glomerular filtration rate 105.9 mL/min per 1.73 m2; total cholesterol 238 mg/dL (reference range 0\u2013200 mg/dL); urine red blood cells 6 to 10 cells/high power field (reference range 0\u20132 cells/high power field); and urine protein to creatinine ratio 3277 mg/g (reference range 0\u2013150 mg/g). Urine dipstick for protein was negative before pembrolizumab treatment. Human immunodeficiency virus antigen and antibody results were negative. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed normal sized kidneys (right kidney: 9.6 cm; left kidney: 10.7 cm) and no evidence of vaso-occlusive processes in the renal arteries.\nShe underwent kidney biopsy for suspected glomerulonephritis. Light microscopic findings of biopsy specimens showed that up to 36 glomeruli, 2 glomeruli exhibited segmental sclerosis with atrophied tubules and fibrosis in the interstitium (Fig. A, B). Electron microscopy revealed wide effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes (Fig. C). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed no immune complexes or autoantibody deposition.\nAfter ruling out other causes of secondary FSGS, she was diagnosed with FSGS caused by pembrolizumab. The patient was started on irbesartan and furosemide to treat high blood pressure, proteinuria, and edema. She did not resume treatment with pembrolizumab and immunosuppressive therapy was not applied. After 2 months, the features of nephrotic syndrome resolved and the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio decreased to 203 mg/g.

    "question": "A 62-year-old man (weight, 59.5 kg; height, 162 cm; BMI, 22.7 kg/m2) was scheduled to undergo a subtotal gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy. The patient had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism one year earlier and had been prescribed medication since then. No specific abnormal laboratory results were noted on the preoperative evaluation except a first degree AV block on the electrocardiograph.\nMidazolam 2 mg was administered i.m. as premedication 30 minutes before anesthesia. In the operating room, the patient was monitored by an electrocardiogram, a noninvasive blood pressure monitor and pulse oximetry. The baseline blood pressure, heart rate, and SpO2 were within the normal range. Before induction, epidural catheterization was performed at the T6-7 interspace with a paramedian approach for continuous postoperative analgesia. There were no questionable signs suggesting a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum during epidural catheterization. Anesthesia was induced with 100 mg of propofol and 40 \u00b5g of remifentanil. Facial mask ventilation was made easy with 100% O2. After an intravenous injection of 50 mg rocuronium, tracheal intubation was performed using a single lumen internal diameter (ID) 8.0 mm tube (Mallinckrodt medical. high volume low pressure. Athlone. Ireland) in one attempt without difficulty. The laryngeal grade was 1 and the tracheal tube was passed through trachea without resistance. The tube was fixed 23 cm from the level of the incisors and the cuff was inflated with 4 ml of air as a minimal volume to prevent a circle leak in this patient. Bilateral breath sounds were confirmed by auscultation. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in air/O2 (FiO2 = 0.5) and supplemental continuous infusion of remifentanil. A nasogastric decompressive tube was not inserted into this patient. No other venous access including central venous line was made. The subtotal gastrectomy with gastroduodenostomy (Billoth I) under the diaphragm proceeded without an event. At the end of surgery, all anesthetic agents were discontinued and the residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with pyridostigmine and glycopyrrolate. The tracheal tube was removed when the patient responded to verbal commands and showed sufficient spontaneous respiration and neuromuscular function (as ascertained by the nerve stimulator). There were no tinged signs of blood or tissue-like material on the removed tube. The patient remained in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) for 30 minutes event free and was then transferred to the general ward. During the 24 hour postoperative period, the patient's vital signs were stable without any specific incidents. On postoperative day 1, the patient complained of discomfort on the left lateral side of the neck without any dysphagia or dyspnea. On palpation, diffuse crepitus was felt on that site of the neck but no definite swelling was detected. Pulse oximetry revealed an oxygen saturation of 91% under room air breathing. Oxygen with a flow rate of 3 L/min was provided through a nasal cannula. The patient had already been placed on nil orally and intravenous antibiotics administration due to surgery. Arterial gas analysis before applying the oxygen showed the following: pH 7.44, PaO2 74.4 mmHg, PaCO2 34.2 mmHg and 95.8% of SaO2. Neck CT (), chest CT () and chest x-ray revealed emphysema of the left neck (), a retropharyngeal space and a pneumomediastinum. The patient was observed closely with an electrocardiograph and pulse oximetry. The patient showed no specific signs or symptoms over the subsequent 24 hours, and the oxygen saturation was maintained at 99-100%. Antibiotics were used for only two days, and a diet was also started. On postoperative day 6, the emphysema of the neck and retraopharynx had almost resolved, but a small amount of air still remained in the mediastinum (). He had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 8. Five days after discharge, the neck AP/lateral x-ray still showed slight emphysematous signs. However, the patient did not feel any discomfort. Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?",

    "question": "A 77-year-old man presented with a complaint of a lump on the upper abdominal wall for several weeks. His performance status (PS) was Grade 2 (Height, 168 cm; Weight, 58 kg; BMI, 20 kg/m2). He had a history of appendicitis that was operated upon. On physical examination, the tumor was located on the upper left side of the abdominal wall measuring around 5 cm with poor mobility and partial ulceration but without pain (Fig. ). At a nearby hospital, he had previously undergone physical examination and computed tomography (CT) for his symptoms. Advanced gastric cancer with invasion to the skin of the abdominal wall was suspected and, for more specific investigation and therapy, he was referred to our department. We obtained informed consent from all participants, and all procedures therapy were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nHis blood investigation revealed the following: hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, white blood cell count 6,060 /\u03bcL, platelets 321,000 /\u03bcL, prothrombin time-international nomarized ratio (PT-INR) 1.05, sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chlorine 105 mmol/L, creatinine 0.91 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 13 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 10 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 249 U/L, \u03b3-guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase (\u03b3-GTP) 14 U/L, LD 156 U/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 0.41 mg/dL, carcinoembryonic antigen-S (CEA-S) 1.6 ng/mL, alpha-fetoprotein 1.83 ng/mL and carbohydorate antigen 19\u20139 (CA 19\u20139) <2 U/mL. There was moderate anemia but there was no organ failure and or elevation of tumor marker.\nOn Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, a Type 3 tumor that measured around 40 mm was observed occupying from the angle of the stomach to the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach (Fig. ).\nOn biopsy, the histological type was revealed as tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1) and immunostaining for HER2 was negative.\nThoracoabdominal enhanced CT revealed invasion of the tumor from the anterior wall of the stomach to the lateral region of the liver and infiltration from the abdominal wall to the skin. There was no evidence of metastasis or ascites (Fig. ).\nOn the basis of these findings, we diagnosed advanced gastric cancer (L-Less, Gre, type 3, 40 mm, tub1), cT4b (SI; liver, skin) N0M0 c Stage IIIA. Initially we anticipated chemotherapy considering that the patient's PS was Grade 2 and the defect of abdominal wall was too large for surgery. In addition, the patient did not want to undergo surgery. S-1+Cisplatin (SP) therapy was performed as first-line therapy every 3 weeks [].\nObvious shrinkage of the tumor invasion to the skin was observed, and we determined that PR was obtained at the end-point of 4th course of SP therapy. However, because of malaise (Grade 2), we had to set a 1-month interval. During the interval, the invasion to the skin gradually increased again; hence, another two courses of SP regimen were added with decreased dose. After six courses of SP therapy had been completed, PR was obtained again by the re-shrinkage of the skin tumor on physical examination and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and CT (Fig. , ). At this point, the patient was not amenable to surgery or chemotherapy; hence, we adopted a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach. During this period, the skin tumor underwent re-growth gradually for which RAM/PTX therapy (3-week administration at 1-week intervals) was introduced as the second line chemotherapy, 2 months after the previous one []. Over the course of therapy, anemia (Grade 3) and neutropenia (Grade 2) were observed and we were compelled to skip one administration each of PTX in course 2 and 3but RAM dosage was completely administrated through all five courses (Fig. ). Throughout the second line of therapy, the skin tumor kept decreasing visually and enhanced abdominal CT revealed the shrinkage of the primary tumor and the invasion to the lateral area of the liver and skin. Similar findings were observed on gastrointestinal endoscopy; and hence, we determined that PR was obtained again (Fig. ). Since his general condition was observed have improved, we planned to perform surgery with the aim of reaching a chemotherapy-free status.\nWe performed open total gastrectomy with D2 lymph nodes dissection (Roux-en-Y reconstruction) with combined partial resection of the skin, abdominal wall, and liver. There were no findings of the peritoneal dissemination, metastasis to the liver, or ascites (Fig. ). The components separation method was performed for abdominal wall closure with the defect of the skin by exposure of the anterior sheath of abdominal rectal muscles and resection of partial aponeurosis of the right external abdominal oblique muscle.

    "question": "A 58-year-old obese woman presented to the emergency department of our hospital with recurrent episodes of constrictive chest pain during exercise within the last 2 weeks (de novo AP). She described similar symptomatology a few years ago, but she did not have any medical evaluation at that time. The patient denied shortness of breath during daily activities, dizziness, or syncope. Her past medical history revealed type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidemia, with an estimated 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease of 3% according to SCORE risk chart. She was on chronic ambulatory medication with bisoprolol 5 mg quaque die (QD), perindopril 5 mg QD, atorvastatin 20 mg QD, and metformin 1000 mg bis in die with good medication adherence. There was no family history of cardiac diseases.\nFocused clinical examination on admission revealed class I obesity (height = 156 cm, weight = 80 kg, body mass index = 33 kg/m2); blood pressure was 120/65 mm Hg, heart rate was 56 bpm, heart and lung sounds were normal with no audible cardiac murmurs, respiratory rate was 17 breaths/min and peripheral oxygen saturation was 98% in ambiental air.\nLaboratory workup revealed impaired fasting glucose (112 mg/dL = 6.2 mmol/L), high values for total cholesterol (210 mg/dL = 5.43 mmol/L), LDL-cholesterol (157 mg/dL = 4 mmol/L) and tryglicerides (157 mg/dL = 1.76 mmol/L), high NTproBNP (1120 pg/mL) and normal myocardial necrosis markers, including serial determination of myoglobin (33\u201328 ng/mL, cut-off value 60 ng/mL), high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (23-8-13 ng/L, cut-off value 54 ng/L), and creatinkinase (CK/CK-MB = 61/21\u2013 84/15\u201352/17 UI/L, cut-off value 280/22 U/l). Routine liver and kidney function blood tests were within normal range (serum creatinine: 0.85 mg/dL = 75 \u03bcmol/L, blood urea nitrogen: 15.85 mg/dL = 5.66 mmol/L, AST = 32 U/L, ALT = 47 U/L).\nThe resting ECG on admission during pain-free interval showed biphasic T-waves with terminal negative component (+/\u2212) in leads V2 to V6, DIII, aVF and minimal ST depression in leads DI and aVL (Fig. ).\nTransthoracic echocardiography revealed interventricular septum and anterior wall hypokinesia with preserved global left ventricular ejection fraction (55%) and mild mitral regurgitation.\nWe established the diagnosis of low-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome with a Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score of 92 points.\nThe patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit and monitored with continuous telemetry. Following her presentation, the patient was immediately started on aspirin 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg QD orally, clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg QD orally, atorvastatin 80 mg QD orally, and a bolus of 5000 IU of unfractioned heparin. Keeping in mind that our patient presented ECG findings compatible with type A Wellens pattern, which is highly specific (89%) for critical LAD stenosis, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization the same day. Coronary angiography showed subocclusive dynamic obstruction of the LAD due to MB (Figs. and ). The ECG taken the next day showed diffuse T waves flattening (Fig. ).\nThe patient was managed conservatively. Her hospital course was uneventful and she was discharged on pharmacological therapy (clopidogrel, bisoprolol, amlodipine, atorvastatin, and metformin) with well-controlled symptoms on follow-up.

    "question": "A 19 years old man was admitted to our hospital after a high energy motorcycle accident in February 2018. The patient presented with a severe varus deformity of the left thigh and an ipsilateral open fracture of the distal femur, without neurovascular injuries. Associated injuries were a left wrist trans-scaphoid trans-styloid perilunate fracture-dislocation and a right occipital condyle fracture. The patient height was 1,95 m and weight 115 kg. The patient had a previous motorcycle accident with a femoral diaphyseal fracture treated with an antegrade T2 Recon nail (StrykerTM) almost 2 years before the recent trauma. Anamnestic data revealed full weight bearing without aids and full return to everyday life at the latest follow-up outpatient evaluation (18 months after surgery). However, the patient referred dull pain at the fracture site at weight bearing, with radiographic signs suspect for hypertrophic nonunion (). Plain radiographs obtained at the emergency department showed a refracture of the femoral shaft in correspondence to the nonunion site with 145\u00b0 nail angulation in the coronal plane. The distal locking screws were also bent (). A comminuted fracture of the distal femur (AO type 33 C3) was confirmed, occurring at the tip of the previously implanted nail. The patient was treated in the first hours with a damage control procedure. An external fixator bridging the knee joint was applied in order to gain length, axis and rotation at the distal femur fracture site (). Accurate debridement of the open fracture was carried out, classifying the lesion as Gustilo () type II open fracture after the procedure. Primary closure of soft tissue was achieved. After surgery the patient was kept under observation for three days in intensive care unit and transferred to our orthopedics and traumatology unit afterwards. Definitive treatment was scheduled on the seventh day after trauma. Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?",

    "question": "A 57-year-old lady presented with exertional dyspnea and NYHA class II angina since last 3 years which had aggravated in last 6 months. She had been previously diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and was put on medical treatment.\nPhysical examination was unremarkable except a soft (grade II/VI) continuous murmur that was heard most clearly over the pulmonary area. An electrocardiogram was normal without any evidence of ischemia, and echocardiogram showed mild dilatation of the left atrium and left ventricle. Coronary angiography demonstrated multiple coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistulae originating from the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary arteries (RCA). There were no flow-limiting lesions in the coronary arteries. There was TIMI III flow in coronary vessels distal to the origin of the fistulae [Figures and ]. After a thorough discussion during the weekly catheterization meeting, it was decided to close the fistulae surgically in order to alleviate symptoms. Issues that prompted against transcatheter intervention were acute angle of origin of the fistula arising from LAD and the excessive tortuosity that would make transcatheter coil embolization of the coronary fistula extremely cumbersome and complex. Intra-operatively, the coronary fistulae were confirmed to be originating from the RCA and the LAD and terminating into pulmonary artery with an intervening \u201cfistula lake.\u201d The \u201clake\u201d next to the LAD was identified, and the vessels feeding this lake were occluded with surgical clips as were the vessels coming from RCA. The aneurysmal sac was further obliterated using a larger surgical clip. Post-operative coronary angiogram showed no evidence of residual fistulae [Figures and ].

    "question": "Our patient was a 60-year-old Caucasian male who presented in September 2019 with syncope associated with hypotension.\nThe patient had no previous symptoms and syncope was indeed the first clinical manifestation.\nThe patient had no history of previous disease and he was not taking any medications.\nThe only red flags were the known congenital bicuspid aortic valve and family history of congestive heart failure (sister).\nWhen he came to the emergency department, he presented hypotensive, with tachyarrhythmic peripheral pulse. A paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) episode was diagnosed, which regressed after a few hours.\nRoutine laboratory tests (complete blood count, kidney function, electrolytes, liver and heart enzymes) were all in the normal ranges.\nTransthoracic echocardiography showed no pathological findings.\nThe 24-h electrocardiogram Holter monitoring recorded frequent episodes of high-grade atrioventricular block with no further AF episodes. Upon suspicion of an ischemic aetiology, he was admitted to the cardiology unit and underwent coronarography, which indicated intermediate stenosis (50%) in the left anterior descending artery. This stenosis was not considered hemodynamically significant. Thus, the decision was to implant a dual chamber anti-bradycardia pacemaker. Given the single and short AF episode and the CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0, no anticoagulation treatment was initiated. In December 2019, he underwent a scintigraphy stress\u2013rest test, during which he presented loss of consciousness due to the onset of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (Figure ), which was successfully treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres and lidocaine infusion. The arrhythmia was considered to be of ischaemic origin. Therefore, the patient underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation at the known coronary stenosis. During and after hospitalization, numerous non-sustained VTs were recorded, for which he was given amiodarone, with clinical benefit. After a few weeks, a treadmill stress test was also performed under antiarrhythmic therapy, which was negative for both myocardial ischemia and VTs. During the follow-up examinations, considering the patient\u2019s clinical picture, encompassing VT, atrioventricular block, family history, and echocardiographic findings showing accentuated right ventricular apex trabeculation, the treating cardiologist decided to reassess the clinical case. He recommended that the patient undergo cardiac magnetic resonance and molecular analysis performed with a panel of 128 genes known to be associated with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies. Both tests were performed in February 2020 (6 wk after DES implantation, as indicated in the manufacturer\u2019s data sheet). The former showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50% without any areas of late enhancement or myocardial fibrosis (Figure ).\nThe results of the genetic testing took 3 mo to be validated, during which outpatient appointments with patients were suddenly stopped due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related pandemic. Considering the need to supervise the patient during this time for the possible onset of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia (LTVT) and AF, without the possibility of a periodic in person interrogation of the PM arrhythmias registry, as was usually done, it was decided to give the patient a remote monitoring device (Medtronic Carelink Network\u00ae). The device was configurated to transmit the data it recorded, automatically every week. At the same time, both LTVT and AF were set up as \u201ccare alerts\u201d, which meant that an automatic alert would have been sent immediately after identification, , as long as the potential LTVT or AF onset would have required a prompt and potentially lifesaving intervention, either the upgrading the PM to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or the initiation of a life-long anticoagulant therapy, respectively. Fortunately, no arrhythmias were detected during that time. What is the patient's HEART score?",

    "question": "A 22-year-old woman from sub-Saharan Africa presented to our emergency department after 1 week of dyspnoea, leg swelling, and haemoptysis. Haemoptysis had started as blood-streaked sputum 3\u20134 weeks before, gradually increasing to multiple daily blood clot expectorations within 2 weeks.\nIn her past medical history, we highlight a triple valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease at age 16 (19-mm CarboMedics mechanical aortic valve prosthesis; 27-mm CarboMedics mechanical mitral valve prosthesis; 27-mm Magna biological tricuspid valve prosthesis). Her medical history also comprised a right middle cerebral artery stroke at age 17, conditioning left hemiplegia and aphasia at presentation with subsequent full recovery. In addition, she was known for chronic haemolytic anaemia and thalassaemia trait. The patient denied any allergy, and her family history was unremarkable. She was taking vitamin K antagonists for anticoagulation.\nUpon presentation, the patient was apyretic and her blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg. She was comfortable at rest, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III. Heart rate was 110 b.p.m. and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Her physical examination was characterized by prosthetic heart sounds with a 4/6 systolic murmur, diminished breath sounds in lung bases, mild hepatomegaly, moderate bilateral ankle oedema, and mild jugular venous distention.\nElectrocardiogram on presentation showed sinus tachycardia at 105 b.p.m. with first-degree atrioventricular block. Arterial blood gas test showed compensated respiratory alkalosis. Lab tests showed mild microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, reference interval (RI) 12.5\u201314.0 g/dL) and an International Normalized Ratio of 4.13 (RI 0.80\u20131.16). Renal function and electrolytes were between normal ranges, while mild liver enzyme alterations were recorded (total bilirubin 3.8 mg/dL, RI 0.20\u20130.90 mg/dL). Brain natriuretic peptide was 401 pg/mL (RI 10\u2013100 pg/mL). C-reactive protein and procalcitonine were both negative. Chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart with minimal bilateral pleural effusion.\nThe patient was hospitalized for heart failure and haemoptysis. Daily treatment with intravenous furosemide 40 mg and bisoprolol 1.25 mg was started. Haemoptysis was treated with inhaled tranexamic acid 500 mg twice a day and iced saline lavages. Warfarin was stopped; enoxaparin 6000 IU twice a day was started. Airway bleeding rapidly improved.\nChest computed tomography (CT) scans excluded pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and neoplasms. Pulmonary tuberculosis was ruled out with a negative sputum smear examination and negative molecular tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Echocardiogram during sinus tachycardia showed normally functioning prosthetic aortic and mitral valves, a hyperdynamic left ventricular wall motion with above-normal ejection fraction. Right ventricular longitudinal function was preserved and the biological tricuspid prosthesis showed an increased transvalvular gradient (mean gradient 13 mmHg, ) and a mild-to-moderate regurgitation; pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be estimated. Inferior vena cava (IVC) was dilated (22 mm) with reduced collapsibility. No echocardiographic finding was suspicious for infective endocarditis. Contrast chest CT scan excluded pulmonary embolism, arteriovenous malformations, and additional scans excluded possible mechanical valve obstruction, such as pannus or thrombi. It also revealed marked systemic venous hypertension, manifesting as dilation of venae cavae, suprahepatic veins, cardiac veins, and of the coronary sinus (). It showed also veno-venous shunts, as well as mild ascites and hepatomegaly. Right heart catheterization confirmed increased right heart pressures, severe bioprosthetic tricuspid valve stenosis (mean gradient 9 mmHg), elevated venous pressure in venae cavae, and a mean right atrial pressure of 22 mmHg (). The increase in venous pressures due to tricuspid stenosis caused veno-venous shunts, resulting in augmented venous pressure in the azygos vein and in the bronchial circulation, eventually leading to haemoptysis.\nSevere symptomatic tricuspid stenosis was referred for surgery. Due to the high operative mortality and morbidity of redo tricuspid valve surgery, pre-operative evaluation was challenging. Eventually, due to the patient\u2019s age and the possible long-term need for reoperation, we opted for a percutaneous approach. The patient underwent transfemoral tricuspid valve-in-valve replacement, using an Edward Sapien 3 (29 mm) bioprosthesis (). Early post-procedural echocardiogram showed a normally functioning bioprosthetic tricuspid valve, no paravalvular leakage, a mean transvalvular gradient of 4\u20135 mmHg (), and a slight reduction in IVC diameter (19 mm).\nThe patient was discharged asymptomatic in NYHA class I. Discharge medications included bisoprolol 1.25 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, and warfarin. Complete resolution of airway bleeding was recorded. During a follow-up visit at 6 months, the patient denied any airway bleeding but complained of occasional palpitation. Echocardiogram at 6 months showed normally functioning tricuspid valve-in-valve bioprosthesis, mean transvalvular gradient 5 mmHg, no paravalvular leak; IVC diameter 12 mm.

    "question": "A 31-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of palpitations of 2 h duration. He has no history of chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncopal attack. He had experienced one similar episode 18 months previously that had responded to medical treatment in another hospital. No old medical report was available, and he could not recall what drugs he had been given. There was no significant past medical, family, or surgical history and he was not on any regular medication. He did not smoke and denied any use of alcohol or illicit drug.\nPhysical examination revealed blood pressure (BP) of 107/72 mm Hg and heart rate of 225 beats/min. On cardiac examination, S1 and S2 were normal, no murmurs, or additional sounds. The chest was clear on auscultation. ECG revealed a narrow complex tachycardia, RBBB, and LAD [].\nIntravenous adenosine, amiodarone and beta blocker wee tried but failed to terminate the arrhythmia. Cardiology consultation was sought and a diagnosis of fascicular tachycardia was suspected based on ECG findings of narrow complex tachycardia, RBBB and LAD. Additional doses of intravenous verapamil were given which slowed down the heart rate to 170 beats/min. The ECG revealed tachyarrhythmias with AV dissociation which suppots that the origin of tachyarrhythmia was from the left ventricle []. After 12 hours, patient developed shortness of breath and dizziness associated with hypotension with BP 81/50 mmHg. An electrical cardioversion was attempted but failed to terminate the arrhythmia.\nSubsequently, patient was admitted to the coronary care unit where serial ECGs were done. Laboratory tests revealed normal hemoglobin, liver function tests, renal function tests, serum electrolytes, and thyroid-stimulating hormone.\nInitial transthoracic echocardiography during tachycardia revealed moderate global hypokinesia with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%; other structures were normal. After obtaining informed consent, an electrophysiological study was performed. The electroanatomical bipolar voltage map did not show any area of the ventricular scar. The mechanism of the tachycardia was confirmed as reentry arising from the basal and mid septum. Multiple ablations were performed to the basal and mid septum, guided by Purkinje and P2 potential. The arrhythmia was terminated after ablation, and no arrhythmias could be induced after Isoprenaline administration. The final ECG showed sinus rhythm [].\nAfter 24 hours, transthoracic echocardiography was repeated showing normal structures with normal LVEF of 60%. The patient was discharged from the cardiac department after 48 hours with cardiology follow up. What is the patient's HEART score?",

    "question": "A 43-year-old nonalcoholic male, on treatment for type 2 diabetes for more than 6 years with oral hypoglycemic drugs, presented with worsening of glycemic control, weight loss (5 kg), and fatigability. However, due to these symptoms, he stopped all his medications about 6 months ago. The patient's body mass index was 19.5 kg/m2 with HbA1c ~ 12. Other investigations done showed that hemoglobin level, total leukocyte count, lipid profile, and renal function test were within normal limits except for mild elevation of liver function test (total bilirubin \u2013 1.7; direct \u2013 0.7; indirect \u2013 1.0, and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \u2013 54).\nSince he was found to be a lean diabetic with no family history of type 2 DM, C-peptide level along with other routine investigations was done. Serum C-peptide at fasting (using chemiluminescence Immunoassay method) was 0.37 ng/ml (normal value: 0.8\u20133.5 ng/ml), so a possibility of autoimmune DM was thought and anti-insulin and anti-islet cell antibodies were tested which turned out to be negative. No excessive insulin resistance was noted as evidenced by HOMA-IR of 0.4. Further evaluation of pancreatic function revealed normal amylase and lipase levels. Deranged liver function prompted us to do an ultrasound abdomen to rule out the possibility of hepatic or gallbladder pathologies [].\nSurprisingly, ultrasound showed atrophic pancreas, multiple tiny hyperechogenic foci with postacoustic shadowing noted in the head and body of the pancreas (suggestive of calcifications). The main pancreatic duct appeared dilated with an intraductal calculus seen []. No peripancreatic fat stranding or fluid collection was seen. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed chronic calcific pancreatitis [Figures and ].\nThe expensiveness of fecal elastase for evaluation of the exocrine function of the pancreas precluded the patient from doing it. However, indirect tests of pancreatic functions showed low Vitamin D level (25-hydroxycholecalciferol), i.e., 10.1 ng/ml (normal: 30\u2013100), slightly increased prothrombin time (an indirect measure of Vitamin K) ~14.5 s (normal 10\u201314), and marginally lower spectrum of triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein ratio ~ 1.1, indicating fat malabsorption.\nThere was an ambiguity in classifying him as type I or II, as his anti-insulin and anti-islet cell autoantibodies were negative and he also did not have evidence of insulin resistance. Identification of CP by ultrasound made the diagnosis of pancreatogenic DM-type 3c possible. Henceforth, the management protocol was modified with addition of insulin, withdrawing oral hypoglycemic agents. He was also started on a modified low carbohydrate diet with Vitamin D and omega-3 supplements. The patient's glycemic control improved (HbA1c ~ 6) and weight increased by 5 kg within the next 4 months. Further follow-up after 2 months showed sustained glycemic control and weight gain.

    "question": "A 61-year-old Caucasian woman, previously in good health, presented with a three-day history of feeling generally unwell with dizziness, vomiting, abdominal, left lower chest pain and shoulder pain. She denied any sore throat, feeling feverish or other symptoms suggestive of an influenza-like illness. There was no cough or sputum production. There was nothing in the history to suggest a recent viral or other infective process including human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency state and no history of any trauma or injury. She had no significant previous medical or surgical history and was not taking any medications. There was no background or family history of cancer, hematologic or clotting disorders. She was a smoker of approximately 40 pack years and had unlimited exercise tolerance. She worked as a nurse and there was no history of previous exposure to asbestos or other occupational hazards.\nOn examination she was ill-looking, conscious and orientated with a blood pressure 89/49 mmHg, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, saturations 97% on a non-rebreather mask and temperature of 36.9\u00b0C. The admission examination revealed normal cardiac examination and bibasal inspiratory crepitations with left upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness on abdominal examination.\nHer blood work-up on admission showed a hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/L, white cell count of 19 \u00d7 109/L with neutrophils of 17 \u00d7 109/L and a C-reactive protein of 7 mg/L. Urea and electrolytes, liver function and coagulation tests were in the normal range. A blood film examination did not reveal any atypical lymphocytes or other abnormalities. A posteroanterior and lateral chest radiograph was performed (Figure ).\nHemodynamic stability was achieved following rehydration with intravenous fluids. However, eight hours after admission she developed an acute abdomen with clinical signs of shock. Her blood pressure was 88/52 mmHg and heart rate 105 beats per minute. Further to that her oxygen saturations were 91% on a non-rebreather mask with a Glasgow coma scale of 14/15 (E = 4, V = 4, M = 6). Inspection revealed skin and conjunctival pallor. Clinical examination revealed new abdominal signs of generalized abdominal tenderness with guarding, rigidity and absent bowel sounds, consistent with an acute abdomen. A repeat test showed her hemoglobin level had dropped to 5.0 g/L.\nShe was stabilized with multiple blood transfusions and underwent an urgent computer tomography scan of her thorax and abdomen, which showed an 8.5 \u00d7 3.6 cm left hilar mass with extensive mediastinal adenopathy, bibasal small effusions and consolidation, and a large splenic hematoma of 15 \u00d7 12 cm with high attenuation suggestive of active bleeding (Figure , Figure and ). There was a lytic area affecting her T9 vertebra, which likely represented metastases rather than wedge fracture, but there were no abnormalities or neoplastic disease affecting the intra-abdominal organs.\nPneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines were administered and our patient was then promptly taken to theater for laparotomy. On examination of her internal organs at laparotomy, other than hemorrhage and rupture of her spleen, there was no other gross abnormality and no evidence of disease in her other intra-abdominal organs. She spent two days being ventilated in our intensive care unit and subsequently made a full recovery from the surgery. She was commenced on life-long penicillin V and was subsequently discharged home a week after admission, fully mobile and independent in terms of her activities of daily living.\nHer splenic histology was negative for hematologic or other malignancy and no other pathology was identified. She then underwent a bronchoscopy; transbronchial needle aspiration revealed numerous malignant nodes consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. Histology of bronchial biopsies confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma. This was consistent with likely stage IV in view of the likely bone metastases found on CT. She was referred to the local oncologist and her case was discussed at the lung cancer multidisciplinary team meeting. In view of the diagnosis and staging, a palliative treatment pathway was agreed from the outset and our patient received palliative chemotherapy. She died five months after her presentation.

    "question": "A 50-year-old Hispanic male presented with moderate chest pain and discomfort that began the night prior to admission. On presentation, the patient was noted to have a fever of 39.5\u00b0C and found to be tremulous with marked altered mental status. Shortly after admission, the patient reportedly suffered multiple witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures for which he was emergently treated with lorazepam. The rest of the history could not be obtained from the patient due to his somnolent status. The family was therefore called at the patient\u2019s bedside. They reported that the patient has a history of heavy alcohol consumption and was complaining of chest pain prior to presentation. They denied any history of seizures or patient noting any weakness or numbness prior to arriving to the hospital. Given the patient\u2019s history of alcohol withdrawal, persistent fever and deteriorating clinical condition, the patient was taken to medical ICU for treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The patient did not have any other known chronic medical conditions. Initial complete blood count showed leukocytosis of 19.63 with bandemia and metabolic profile showed lactic acidosis. Initial electrocardiogram evaluation demonstrated sinus tachycardia with an unremarkable cardiac physical examination. Initial chest X-ray was unremarkable and non-enhanced CT of the head did not show any acute intracranial abnormalities. Ultrasound of the liver showed findings of hepatic steatosis, with patient having negative results for hepatitis panel, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA). The patient met systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute, fever of 39.5\u00b0C and leukocytosis of 19.63 for which reason two sets of blood cultures from different sites were collected for microbiological analysis and the patient was started on empiric piperacillin-tazobactam within hours of admission. Soon after initiating treatment for sepsis and alcohol withdrawal, patient\u2019s altered mental status resolved, and his condition began to improve. Subsequent neurological exams done on the patient were all unremarkable with no signs of focal neurological deficits. Blood cultures subsequently grew multiple gram-negative rod species, later confirmed as various Salmonella spp. on two out of two plates at 12 and 24 hours, respectively. Antibody analyses revealed the following serotypes: Salmonella H, type-a, Salmonella H, type-b, Salmonella H, type-d, and Salmonella O, type-Vi. These findings prompted a transthoracic echocardiogram study which was unremarkable which led to a subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The TEE ultimately revealed a small 2.5 mm x 2.7 mm echo dense vegetation or mass observed on the aortic valve (Figure ).\nGiven the patient\u2019s aortic native valve endocarditis and gram-negative non-HACEK etiology per the IDSA/AHA guidelines, the patient as started on dual therapy, which based on susceptibility resulted in a regimen of cefepime and levofloxacin. As per the ACC/AHA guidelines, the patient did not meet the criteria for surgical considerations. The patient did not meet the criteria of complicated IE, which included findings such as heart failure, intra-cardiac abscess or fistula, native valve S. aureus IE, or systemic embolization. Hence cardio-thoracic surgery input was not sought and prolonged antibiotic therapy was recommended []. After multiple negative blood cultures at 48 hours, along with clinical stabilization at the hospital the patient was discharged on oral levofloxacin 750 mg and IV cefepime 2 g twice daily for six weeks. At his six-week follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, with negative blood culture and unremarkable labs at the end of therapy. What is the patient's HEART score?",

She reported no family history of bleeding, clotting, or rheumatologic disorders, no drug allergies, and toxic habits. She had one healthy baby delivered vaginally five years ago. She was never on oral contraceptive medications.\nOn presentation, her pulse rate was 116 beats per minute and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Her body mass index (BMI) was 29. On examination, her breath sounds were decreased bilaterally due to pain. Her right lower extremity was swollen compared to the left lower extremity. Her neurological examination was normal and no skin rashes were noted. Her electrocardiogram revealed Q waves in lead III and S wave in lead I, in the setting of sinus tachycardia. Her laboratory tests showed a prothrombin time of 11.2 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time of 51.9 seconds, D-dimer of 424 ng/mL, troponin T <12 ng/L, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 91 pg/mL. The Wells score was calculated to be 6. Doppler venous ultrasonography did not reveal any deep venous thrombus. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging of the chest revealed partially occlusive pulmonary emboli within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right anterior lung basal arteries.

The patient had a history of hypertension, type-2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertriglyceridemia, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic back pain and depression. Surgical history included left popliteal-femoral bypass and coronary artery stenting. He had 25-pack-years history of smoking, but denied significant alcohol or illicit drug use. His customary medications were lantus insulin, glimeperide, verapamil, losartan, aspirin, rosuvastatin, fenofibrate, cilostazole, esomeprazole, dicyclomine, eszopiclone, venlafaxine, alprazolam, testosterone lotion, and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.\nOn physical examination, he was alert but not oriented, and in severe respiratory distress. Blood pressure (BP) was 160/94 mmHg in right arm, pulse rate was 140 per minute, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, and temperature was 38.4oC. The Oxygen saturation via pulse oximeter was 86% while the patient was breathing 100% O2 by non-rebreather mask. There was decreased air movement at both lung bases, and consolidation at right lung base. Cardiac examination showed no abnormalities except tachycardia. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\nThe initial labs and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis are shown in and . Serum lactate at the beginning was elevated at 4.1 mmol/L (normal: 0.5-1 mmol/L). Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with rate of 144 beats per minute. A chest radiograph showed increased interstitial markings and right lower lobe infiltrates (). Urine analysis study revealed presence of urinary tract infection and results are shown in . He was immediately started on fluid replacement, intravenous (IV) antibiotics which included levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin, and high flow oxygen, and was transferred to medical intensive care unit (ICU) for further care.\nLater on, patient went into severe respiratory distress, and endotrachial intubation was performed. Soon after intubation, patient went into pulseless electrical activity, and a code blue was called. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was performed as per standard protocol for 15 minutes, and patient came back to sinus rhythm. After the code, patient was hypotensive and required three vasopressors including epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine to maintain systolic BP more than 90. Oxygen saturation was 90% on 100% FiO2. After one hour, patient again went into cardiac asystole, then ventricular fibrillation, and then pulseless electrical activity. Successful resuscitation was done for 15 minutes. After this second code, the systolic BP was in 80s, and IV phenylephrine was added. Hear rate was 146 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 88% on 100% FiO2. The laboratory results showed lactate level of 12.1 mmol/L; transaminase in 1000's and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 53 mg/dl and 4.9 mg/dl respectively. Serum troponin level was 2.92 ng/ml (normal \u2264 0.04 ng/ml). Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed worsening metabolic acidosis.\nAn emergent two-dimensional echocardiogram was obtained and revealed normal left and right ventricular function. His left ventricular ejection fraction was found to be 50%, and there was no pericardial effusion, or right ventricular strain. Patient was started on IV hydrocortisone, and anidulafungin was added to cover for fungal pathogens. A decision was also made to start patient on activated protein C infusion considering high risk of death. In addition, bicarbonate drip was also started.\nTwelve hours after his admission to this hospital, patient started showing signs of anoxic brain injury. At that time, he was on maximum doses of five vasopressors, but was still hypotensive and tachycardic. The oxygen saturation decreased to 88% on 100% of FiO2. ABG at that time is shown in .

    "question": "An eighty-one-year-old woman without significant cardiovascular risk factors presented to the emergency department with chief compliant of acute onset of severe pressure-like, left-sided chest pain as she was walking back from church in the afternoon. It was associated with nausea but no vomiting, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or palpitations. Prior to the onset of these symptoms she had been in her usual state of health and denied any cardiac complaints.\nHer past medical history was significant for asthma, arthritis, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) diagnosed one year ago by bone marrow biopsy with baseline platelet level 50,000 per \u00b5l requiring no treatment. She reported allergic reaction to aspirin which caused respiratory impairment and never underwent desensitization.\nUpon arrival in the Emergency department chest pain had resolved. She was 5 feet 1 inch and 188 lbs; initial vital signs were blood pressure of 149/79 mmHg and heart rate of 88 bpm. The physical exam including cardiac exam was unremarkable. The electrocardiogram (ECG) () revealed sinus rhythm with premature atrial and ventricular contractions, ST Elevation and Q waves in II, III, and aVF and tall R wave in V2 consistent with infero-post wall MI, STEMI. Laboratory results were significant for platelet count of 34,000 per \u00b5l, decreasing from baseline 50K (without any prior history of bleeding), and cardiac enzymes were as follows: Troponin I initial 0.3929 ng/ml and peaked at 10.9 ng/ml; Creatine Kinase (CPK) 666 U/L and peaked at 800 U/L with CK-MB and CK Index of 54.5 ng/ml and 7.9 respectively. The remainder of laboratory results, including coagulation profile, was normal at this time. The patient received Plavix 600 mg PO, Metoprolol 25 mg orally. An unfractionated heparin was used, with a loading dose of 5,100 international units (IU) intravenously then a continuous intravenous infusion of 13 U/hr with baseline PTT of 33.7 seconds, and transdermal nitroglycerin patch was placed during the emergency department course. Subsequent ECGs () showed formation of Q waves and normalization of the ST-T changes, decision was made to medically treat the patient for the STEMI and plan for cardiac angiography since the patient was chest pain free.\nThe patient later underwent diagnostic coronary angiography via radial approach which revealed a 90% occlusion of the mid right coronary artery (RCA) with a TIMI 1 antegrade flow as well as thrombus formation (). It also revealed a 70% stenosis in the mid left circumflex (LCx) with an aneurysmal segment, a 75% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD), a 70% stenosis in the diagonal (D2) ostium, and non-obstructive disease in the left main. The radial artery approach was uneventful, with the patient having a small proximal hematoma (1 cm x 2 cm approximately) that resolved with pressure dressing and warm compresses within the next 48 hours. Because the patient was stable and had history of aspirin allergy, she underwent aspirin desensitization while being on medical treatment pending staged percuteous coronary intervention (PCI) and stenting to the mid RCA lesion via femoral artery access. Later, the patient underwent successful desensitization of the aspirin and was started on a daily dose of 81 mg of aspirin. Repeat coronary angiography by femoral approach was performed for the PCI and bare metal stent was implanted in the mid RCA without any complications. The procedure was successfully concluded and final flow was TIMI 3 (). Her platelet level post-procedure upon discharge was 32,000 per \u00b5l and had ranged from 20K to 30K. The patient continued to tolerate aspirin 81 mg PO daily and Clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily three months post-procedure with stable platelet count. What is the patient's HEART score?",

An arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed significant lactate acidosis with pH 7.14, pO2 of 15.4 kPa, pCO2 of 4.5 kPa, bicarbonate of 12 mEq/L, base excess of \u221216 mmol/L and lactate value of 12 mmol/L. A 12 lead electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with slight ST-depressions in the leads V4\u20136.\nBedside echocardiography revealed regional hypokinesia in the lateral area of the left ventricle, and an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20\u201330%.\nThe patients\u2019 blood samples demonstrated abnormal with a troponin T of 300 ng/L, white blood cell count of 39 \u00d7 109/L and normal c-reactive protein.\nAn immediate thoracic/abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, testing negative for aortic dissection or large pulmonary embolism. However, a 6 cm large tumor in the left adrenal gland was found in .\nDuring the first hours of observation, the patient\u2019s symptoms spontaneously resolved. His vitals normalized and a repeated ABG showed a rising pH (7.33) and decreasing lactate (5.6 mmol/L).\nMeanwhile, the patient\u2019s previous history was explored in more detail. The evening before his admission, he had consumed multiple energy drinks, but denies the intake of alcohol or any other substances.\nNine years earlier, he presented with similar symptoms at another hospital, likewise had spontaneously recovered and was quickly discharged without a firm diagnosis. Similarly, 4 years prior to this admission, the patient was acutely hospitalized with headache, back pain, nausea, elevated lactate, white blood cell count and blood pressure. That admission summary described that all symptoms remitted, his vitals as well as blood values normalized over a few hours and the patient was discharged after a day of observation, without finding a plausible explanation to his symptoms.\nDue to these findings and the suspicion of pheochromocytoma-induced cardiomyopathy, the patient was admitted.\nDuring the 7-day admission, the patient\u2019s vitals remained normal and blood samples including troponin T slowly normalized. A repeated transthoracic echocardiography showed a LVEF of 45% in .\nPlasma cortisol, renin, aldosterone and a 24-hour urine sample for steroid metabolites were within normal range. 3-Metthoxyadrenalin was elevated to 2,5 nmol/L (normal range: < 0,46 nmol/L) as well as 3-Metthoxynoradrenalin at 29,6 nmol/L (normal range < 1,09 nmol/L).\nDuring this observation, the patient reported no symptoms and was discharged for planned surgery in an outpatient setting.\nDue to the size of the tumor (6 cm in diameter) and hence a slightly increased risk of malignancy, open left-sided adrenalectomy was performed [].\nThe patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day after uncomplicated surgery and observation period. Follow-up showed normalization of 3-metthoxyadrenalin and 3-metthoxynoradrenalin, and the patient had not experienced any symptoms or complications.\nThe left adrenal gland was found with a well-defined pheochromocytoma with a maximum diameter of 25 mm. The tumor morphology was with the growth of large nests and solid areas, high cellularity and areas with spindle cells as well as areas with profound nuclear pleomorphism and nuclear hyperchromasia. Thus, the Pheochromocytoma of Adrenal Gland Scales (PASS) score was 8 in []. It is not possible to predict the malign potential of a pheochromocytoma from the histopathology, but a PASS score > 4 indicates potential for aggressive clinical behavior. Thus, the patient will be followed with annually blood tests (3-metthoxyadrenalin, 3-metthoxynoradrenalin) lifelong. []. What is the patient's HEART score?",

    "question": "An 83-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus type 2, essential hypertension, and hyperlipidemia came to the emergency department with history of 3 days of progressive cough and shortness of breath and 1 day of pressure-like chest pain and anxiety. She did not have a history of smoking. Initial physical examination revealed a patient in severe respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation (O2Sat) was 94% with a nonrebreather mask at 80% FIO2 and cardiovascular examination revealed a soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur located in the left sternal border, without gallops. Diffused rales were auscultated in both lung fields. The rest of examination and vital signs were unremarkable.\nABG analysis showed acute respiratory alkalosis with moderate hypoxemia and laboratory panels including complete blood count, electrolytes, and troponins were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal; chest X-ray and chest computed tomography angiography exhibited diffuse interstitial ground-glass opacities bilaterally suggestive of pulmonary edema and no filling defects ruling out pulmonary embolism. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and treated with bilevel positive airway pressure and intravenous diuretics demonstrating a slight clinical improvement; however, hypoxemia persisted and orthodeoxia was identified. O2Sat decreased significantly from 91% in decubitus to 86% when adopting a sitting position.\nEchocardiography (TTE) showed ejection fraction 50\u201355% with RVSP 63 and a slightly positive agitated saline contrast test (ASCT) consistent with an interatrial shunting. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed showing a positive interatrial communication; nevertheless, images were inconclusive to further evaluate and to determine the precise location of this interatrial defect due to suboptimal echocardiographic images. Cardiac magnetic resonance was not definitive for the presence of an atrial septal defect. Coronary computed tomography angiography was recommended and exhibited mild nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis and nonspecific pulmonary vascular congestion with no evidence of atrial septal defect or an unroofed coronary sinus.\nDecision was made to clarify the diagnosis with a right heart catheterization and intracardiac echocardiography, which revealed an intact interatrial septum with an evident PFO. An absent \u201cstep up\u201d in saturation ruled out a left-to-right shunt. A TTE with ASCT was repeated and performed in reversed Trendelenburg position demonstrating a strongly and obvious right-to-left shunt through a PFO (). The defect was emergently closed using an 18 mm Amplatzer Cribriform Septal Occluder (). The patient expressed sudden severe chest pain after the procedure. ECG exhibited ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, followed by a significant decrease in the mean arterial pressure. Bedsides ultrasonography showed proper device position and no cardiac tamponade was noted. Intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted for hemodynamic support and vasopressors were started. A right coronary artery air embolism was suspected; therefore a coronary angiogram was performed and showed no abnormalities. Left ventricular angiogram and aortogram were within normal parameters.\nThe patient stabilized with resolution of chest pain and normalization of the ECG changes and became normotensive. A TTE was repeated showing normal left ventricle function, no evidence of pericardial effusion, and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient remained hemodynamically stable, vasopressors were weaned off, and the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed. The patient experienced a positive outcome with complete resolution of respiratory failure with low requirements of oxygen therapy. The patient was discharged to home saturating 98% on room air.

Her physical examination showed stable vital signs and was otherwise unremarkable except for trace peripheral edema. The University of Florida does not require IRB approval or written informed consent for any case report with 3 or fewer patients as it is not a clinical study.\nFearing a coronary event, she was given a dose of sublingual nitroglycerine and aspirin. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, but otherwise no apparent abnormality. Laboratory workup was significant for elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 13,456 U/L (reference range: 30\u2013170 U/L), normal troponin-T, normal complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel except elevated creatinine of 1.20 mg/dL (reference range: 0.40\u20130.90 mg/dL). Her chest X-ray revealed no abnormality. CPK levels evaluated in 2012 on this patient while on statins were unremarkable (191 U/L, 165 U/L, and 197 U/L, with reference range of 30\u2013170 U/L).\nShe was admitted to the hospital due to concern for acute coronary event, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal insufficiency, and possible acute viral infection causing her symptoms. Her workup during hospital stay showed three normal serial troponin-T tests, and myocardial perfusion test revealed no abnormality. Her respiratory viral panel and thyroid stimulation hormone level were normal. Her creatinine also normalized with intravenous (IV) fluids. She had persistent elevated CPK levels, which also trended down with IV fluids.\nCommon differential diagnoses for her rhabdomyolysis were explored by detailed history and laboratory workup. There was no history of recent trauma, crush injury, prolonged immobilization, recent surgery, seizures, drug abuse, or alcoholism. Her family history was negative for any kind of myopathy or other hereditary or genetic causes that could explain the elevated CPK value. Her laboratory workup, including thyroid function tests, was unremarkable and failed to explain this episode of rhabdomyolysis. She had been on a stable dose of atorvastatin (40 mg) for several years for hyperlipidemia and reported no myalgias, arthralgias, or abnormal CPK levels. Review of her medication list further revealed that she was started on sitagliptin (Januvia\u00ae 100 mg) almost a week before this presentation. She also correlated her symptoms with starting of this new medication. Sitagliptin and atorvastatin were stopped; her subsequent CPK value showed a decreasing trend and was recorded at 1,220 U/L on the day of discharge.

    "question": "A 77-year-old retired army service man with past history of hypercholesterolaemia and previous tuberculosis presented to the Emergency Department having briefly lost consciousness. On recovering, he was aware of a chest discomfort with radiation to the back and neck. He was an ex-smoker. Initial assessment revealed an irregular pulse with a rate between 30 and 50 bpm and a blood pressure of 103/56 mmHg. Cardiac examination was unremarkable with no murmurs heard and the jugular venous pressure was not raised. Auscultation of the chest was also unremarkable. He had different blood pressures between left (103/56 mmHg) and right arms (76/59 mmHg). His ECG revealed atrial fibrillation, a new finding, partial right bundle branch block and left axis deviation but no other ischaemic changes. A CT aortogram excluded aortic dissection and pulmonary embolus. Blood tests revealed an initial troponin T of 96 ng/l (normal < 14), which subsequently rose to 1088 ng/l. He was treated as an acute coronary syndrome. Echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular impairment with lateral wall hypokinesis and no evidence of intra-cardiac thrombus. Whilst on the ward he complained of intermittent chest discomfort and we proceeded to coronary angiography 48 h after admission, which revealed an unobstructed left main stem and minor irregularities within the left anterior descending artery. The right coronary artery was co-dominant and unobstructed. However, the left circumflex (LCx) artery was co-dominant and there was a large area of solid thrombus covering a 2 cm stretch of the artery. Given the history of atrial fibrillation we felt that this most likely represented an embolic occlusion. A guide wire was placed across the occlusion and the thrombus was aspirated successfully with an aspiration catheter. A significant amount of red thrombus was obtained. Subsequent angiographic images of the LCx revealed a completely smooth normal looking artery without any area of stenosis or irregularity. The patient remained well following his procedure and was discharged on apixaban 5 mg twice daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, bisporolol 2.5 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily and ramipril 1.25 mg daily.\nThere was no evidence of an atrial septal defect or suspicion of a patent foramen ovale on the trans-thoracic echocardiogram thus making the diagnosis of an embolic coronary embolus secondary to atrial fibrillation and possibly thrombus in the left atrial appendage the most likely cause of his myocardial infarction.

    "question": "A 60-year-old male non-smoker, non-diabetic, and normotensive patient was referred to our center with a history of retrosternal chest pain and dyspnea [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV] for two days. The patient had a history of exertional dyspnea and angina (NYHA class II) for the past year, but he was neither on any sort of medication and nor had consulted any physician for the same. The patient denied any past history of fever, joint pain, limb claudication, trauma to the chest. He was a farmer by occupation, and prior to this visit, there was no history of any medication or procedure done on him. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg, pulse was 100/minute, and regular in rhythm. The rest of the cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. An electrocardiogram at admission showed sinus rhythm with ST elevation in inferior leads (lead III/aVF) along with reciprocal ST depression in lead I, aVL, and V5-V6 (Figure ). The cardiac biomarkers were significantly elevated. Initial imaging with chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with enlarged right heart border (Figure ), and 2D-echocardiogram demonstrated inferior wall hypokinesia with mildly reduced left ventricular systolic fraction and a well-circumscribed cystic mass adjacent to the right ventricle (Figures , ). The routine biochemistry findings are provided in Table .\nAngiogram of the left coronary system (Figures -; Videos , ) showed significant left main stenosis with a GCA arising from proximal LAD (Figures -) with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade II flow distal to the aneurysm. Diffuse significant lesions in the proximal left circumflex artery and its major branches were also observed.\nThe ostium of RCA could not be engaged selectively despite several attempts, and a nonselective angiogram revealed occlusion of RCA from the ostium with mild disease in the conal branch of RCA arising from a separate ostium (Figure , Video ).\nSubsequently, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the thorax and coronary CT revealed a partially thrombosed giant aneurysm (80 x 60 mm) arising from the proximal RCA (Figure ), compressing the proximal segment of RCA against the aortic wall and causing occlusion from the ostium and a giant saccular coronary aneurysm (30 x 30 mm) arising from the proximal segment of LAD. No other abnormality was noted in the aorta and other major vessels, nor any signs of vasculitis were detected.\nThe patient was counseled on the need for surgical intervention for his treatment, but he opted for medical management only. He was treated with guideline-directed medical therapy including anticoagulation and was discharged in a hemodynamically stable condition.

    "question": "A 17-year-old girl visited Chungbuk National University Hospital, presenting with fever and abdominal pain that had developed 7 days previously. She had undergone an operation for gastroschisis repair at birth. At the time of admission, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; pulse rate, 70 beats per minute; respiration rate, 18 breaths per minute; and body temperature, 37.5\u2103. She appeared emaciated and acutely ill. Her body mass index was 18.1 (height, 151 cm; and weight, 41.3 kg). A physical examination revealed icteric sclera, a very thin abdominal cavity, and a longitudinal surgical scar at the midline. Tenderness was noted in the upper abdominal area, and normal bowel sounds were heard. There was no particular finding in the limb or neurological examinations. Laboratory analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 27,000 cells/mm3; hemoglobin level, 12.3 g/dL; platelet count, 277,000 cells/mm3; aspartate aminotransferase level, 108 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase level, 144 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase level, 476 IU/L; total protein level, 6.5 g/dL; albumin level, 3.7 g/dL; total bilirubin level, 14.1 mg/dL; direct bilirubin level, 9.2 mg/dL; amylase level, 592 U/L; lipase level, 825 U/L; blood urea nitrogen level, 5.0 mg/dL; and creatinine level, 0.5 mg/dL. These data were compatible with diagnoses of acute cholangitis and acute biliary pancreatitis. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a round calcifying lesion near the pancreas (), and the absence of the retroperitoneal duodenum and the anterior position of the spleen with respect to the left kidney. The anterior and left-sided position of the superior mesenteric vein compared with that of the superior mesenteric artery was observed in the abdominal computed tomography scan (). The coronal view revealed the distorted architecture of the liver and a high-attenuation lesion at the extrahepatic bile duct (). Results of a barium examination revealed a right-sided duodenojejunal flexure and malpositioning of the bowel, with the small bowel on the right side and the colon on the left side (). Intestinal malrotation could be diagnosed based on these findings. ERCP was performed by using a lateral-view endoscope in the usual way. After approaching the ampulla, the endoscope was pushed against the duodenal wall to maintain the papilla in the correct position, and a selective bile duct cannulation confirmed the presence of a 12-mm round stone in the common bile duct. With a guidewire-assisted technique, the single dark brown stone was removed by using a Dormia basket after the endoscopic sphincterotomy (). The procedure lasted for 15 minutes. A cholangiogram obtained through an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube revealed a distorted biliary system, which was characterized with diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, downward-positioned gallbladder and a right intrahepatic biliary tree, and a horizontally located common bile duct. The abnormal orientation of the duodenum suggested intestinal malrotation (). Clinical symptoms and liver function tests normalized after the ERCP procedure. The patient has been monitored for 3 years and is in a normal state. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 43-year-old female with a past medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath, polyuria, dysuria, and polydipsia. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) five days before coming to the hospital. Physical examination revealed hypoxia with decreased lung sounds and negative abdominal findings. Her labs on initial presentation revealed white blood count 21.2x109/L (normal range = 4.5 to 11.0 x 10^9/L), hemoglobin 15.1 gm/dl (normal range = 12 to 15.5 gm/dl), prothrombin time 12 seconds (normal range = 11 to 12.5 seconds), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.2 (normal range = < 1.1), fibrinogen 620 mg/dl (normal range = 200 to 400 mg/dL), D-dimer 2.03 mcg/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) (normal range < 0.5 mcg/mL FEU), blood glucose 430 mg/dl (normal range < 140 mg/dL) with an elevated anion gap, lactate 3.4 mmol/L (normal range = 0.5 to 1 mmol/L), and normal total bilirubin/liver enzymes.\nCT chest revealed extensive consolidative airspace opacities with ground glass opacities while the CT abdomen was normal (Figure ). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for diabetic ketoacidosis and progressive respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation on day 2 of hospitalization. Her pulmonary condition was further complicated by pulmonary edema likely related to cytokine release syndrome. She was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine and as her inflammatory markers continued to rise, she was administered tocilizumab on the day of intubation. Two days after the tocilizumab, the patient also received COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Her ICU course was further prolonged by superimposed bacterial infections including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and meropenem, as well as fungal urinary tract infection, treated with fluconazole. She was successfully extubated eleven days later and was transitioned to the step-down unit.\nOn day 15 of admission, the patient developed severe right upper quadrant pain and back pain.Her complete blood count revealed hemoglobin of 6.1 gm/dl (normal range = 12 to 15.5 gm/dl), platelet count of 217,000/microliter of blood (normal range = 150,000 to 400,00/microliter of blood). The coagulation panel showed a prothrombin time of 13 seconds (normal range = 11 to 12.5 seconds) and an INR of 1.3 (normal < 1.1). Comprehensive metabolic panel revealed a sudden increase in liver enzymes with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1111U/L (normal range = 5 to 40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1020 U/L (normal range = 19 to 25 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 203 IU/L (normal range = 44 to 147 IU/L) with normal total bilirubin (normal range = 0.1 to 1. 2 mg/dL). CT abdomen without contrast revealed a heterogeneous attenuation pattern area in the right hepatic lobe (Figure ). A follow-up ultrasound abdomen with Doppler confirmed patent vasculature. We obtained a three-phase liver CT with contrast which showed large areas of heterogeneous hypodensity and heterogenous enhancement most consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (Figure ). At this point, the patient's hemoglobin had also dropped by 2 gm/dl but fecal occult blood was negative, ruling out any gastrointestinal lumen bleeding. The patient was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells and her prophylactic anticoagulation was held.\nWhile admitted, the patient\u2019s AST peaked at 2177 U/L, ALT peaked at 1881 U/L and ALP peaked at 369 U/L. After discussing with the gastroenterology team, we started her on a trial of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for her acute liver injury. Labs after a 21-hour infusion of NAC revealed a drastic and rapid improvement of her transaminitis. CT abdomen was repeated the next day which showed stabilization in the heterogeneous area in the right hepatic lobe. The patient continued to improve from the cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal point of view and was discharged to an acute care rehab facility with normalized liver enzymes.

    "question": "A 54-year-old male presented to the emergency department for shortness of breath. His past medical history was remarkable for severe emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asbestos exposure, and erosive RA with positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibody. He was diagnosed with RA more than 20 years ago but has only been on steroids in the past, more so for his lung problems. He had never been on DMARDs (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs) treatment and never followed with a rheumatologist. His medications included Spiriva inhaler, Ventolin inhaler, and prednisone 15 mg daily. Social history was remarkable for smoking 40 years of 1.5 PPD and quit 5 months before the presentation. Family history was remarkable for RA in his mother and aunt. He admitted shortness of breath, fever, night sweat, and unintentional weight loss about 30 lbs over the past few months. Physical examination was significant for bilateral lungs wheezing on auscultation, bilateral swan neck deformity of digits, and Z deformity of bilateral thumbs. Joints range of motion was intact with no RA nodule or active synovitis. Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cells 710/\u00b5L with 76% lymphocytes, 6.0% neutrophils, 16% monocytes, 1.0% eosinophils, and 1.0% basophils; hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL; platelet 160 000/\u00b5L; total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase 68 U/L; alanine aminotransferase 18 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase 16 U/L; and serum albumin of 2.4 g/dL. C-reactive protein 3.4 mg/dL, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) was positive, RF was 3810.0 IU/mL, and anti-CCP antibody was 250 U/mL. Serum SSB/SSA, dsDNA, C3, and C4 were within the normal limit. Chest X ray showed pulmonary emphysema, bibasilar subsegmental scarring, and pleural effusion. Bilateral hand X-ray showed carpal periarticular osteopenia, carpal bone erosions, and swan-neck deformity of the bilateral fifth digits. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed mild splenomegaly (14 cm). Hematology/oncology was consulted. Peripheral blood smear revealed numerous large granular lymphocytes. Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were reported as insufficient for diagnosis. Immunophenotyping of bone marrow revealed an increased number of T-cell lymphocytes about 91% of cells analyzed with marked aberrant loss of CD5 and moderate loss of CD7. CD4:CD8 ratio was markedly decreased (0.23) with an abnormal increase in CD8 cells. NK cells were within normal limits. Approximately 40% of the T-cell lymphocytes express a marker profile consistent with T-LGL cell lineage (positive for CD3, CD57, and CD8; negative for CD25). Clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma (TCRG) and beta (TCRB) genes detected by polymerase chain reaction consistent with the presence of a clonal T-cell population. These results were consistent with T-LGL. The patient was diagnosed with T-LGL and started on Cytoxan 100 mg PO (per os) daily. Methotrexate was avoided due to severe lung disease. In 1-year follow-up, leukocyte count was 7860/\u00b5L with neutrophils of 74%. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 76-year-old male presented to the emergency department with recurrent painless bleeding from his ileal conduit site. This was his fifth visit to the hospital with similar complaints. He had a history of muscle invasive bladder cancer with peri-vesical tissue involvement, for which he underwent radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit urinary diversion 7 years prior to presentation, after which he was lost to follow up. He did not take chemotherapy or radiation. He also had a history of Stage III chronic kidney disease, alcohol use of approximately 2\u20133 cans of beer daily for the last 40 years, and a history of medication non-compliance and non-compliance with follow-up appointments. He denied any history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, blood in stools, hematemesis, or any other site of bleeding. He gave a history of fatigue, dizziness, and on and off painless bleeding from his ileal conduit site for over a year. At presentation, his heart rate was 103 beats/min, blood pressure was 126/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 18/min, saturating at 91% on room air. His examination was unremarkable except for gross bleed in his urostomy bag with blood clots. [His investigations revealed a hemoglobin of 3.8 g/dL (13.5\u201317.5), white blood cell count of 6.1 K/\u03bcL (4\u201311 K/\u03bcL), platelet count 114 K/\u03bcL (140\u2013400), International Normalised ratio (INR) 1.38 (0.85\u20131.12), prothrombin time 17.6 s (12.1\u201315.0), total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL (0\u20131.3), aspartate aminotransferase 40 U/L (14\u201359), alanine aminotransferase 36 U/L (11\u201366), and alkaline phosphatase 69 (38\u2013126 U/L).] The patient's creatinine was elevated at presentation at 2.78 mg/dL (0.50\u20131.30), from his baseline creatinine of 1.32 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate = 56 ml/min/1.73 m2). After volume resuscitation, his creatinine improved to 1.4 mg/dL. He was transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBC's). His noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed subtle nodularity of liver contour and mild splenomegaly (14.1 cm in length). Flexible cystourethroscopy through ileal conduit showed a small area of hemorrhage in the anterior portion of the conduit just deep to the abdominal wall fascia. The hemorrhagic site was fulgurated without evidence of other bleeding sites. On further examination, purple discoloration of the ileal stomal site was noticed []. Given his recurrent episodes of bleeding from the stomal site, purplish discoloration of the skin around the stoma, and liver nodularity, there was a high degree of suspicion of underlying liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and extrahepatic peristomal varices. He underwent CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, which showed heterogeneous density and enhancement of the liver, nodularity of the liver edge, and parastomal varices with mild ascites []. He was treated conservatively with octreotide for variceal bleeding. During the evaluation of his liver cirrhosis, his hepatitis C antibody was reactive, and his hepatitis C RNA load was 121012 IU/mL. Evaluation for hepatitis B was negative; abdominal Doppler did not show any portal venous thrombosis. His model for end-stage liver disease score at the time of TIPS procedure was 16 points, 6% estimated 3-month mortality. He successfully underwent TIPS with portosystemic pressure gradient reduction from 10 to 4 mmHg in addition to the coil embolization of ileal conduit varices by an interventional radiologist. The patient was advised to follow up with hepatology and gastroenterology for further evaluation for cirrhosis and treatment of his hepatitis C infection, respectively, and with endoscopy for evaluation of esophageal varices. He was seen in the hepatology clinic at 5 months; at which time he did not have any new episode of bleeding He was lost to follow-up after that appointment.

    "question": "A 35-year-old female with ESRD was admitted to our hospital 2 years ago. She had a history of aplastic anaemia since she was 11 years old and was complicated by chronic hepatitis C probably due to frequent blood transfusion. She underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation at the age of 32. Her renal function deteriorated rapidly after the treatment. She started PD with the regimen of a single 6-h dwell of 2 L glucose dialysate. Considering that her genotype of HCV was 2a, which is known to be more susceptible to IFN therapy than genotype 1, and that she was a candidate for cadaveric kidney transplant, we decided to treat her with PEG-IFN alpha-2a (Pegasys&#61650, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland) monotherapy 1 year after the beginning of PD.\nLaboratory results before introduction of PEG-IFN were as follows: white blood cell count, 7000/\u03bcL; neutrophil count, 56%; haemoglobin, 9.9 g/dL; platelet count, 261 000/\u03bcL; serum albumin, 3.9 g/dL; aspartate transferase, 13 IU/L; alanine transferase, 16 IU/L and HCV-RNA, 3600 KIU/ml. Because IFN may adversely affect residual renal function, we adopted a dose escalation strategy in order to minimize the total dose of PEG-IFN. Thus, the treatment was initiated at a dose of 30 \u03bcg subcutaneously once a week for the first 6 weeks, being escalated to a maximum dose of 90 \u03bcg over the next 4 weeks and continued for subsequent 38 weeks. The plasma HCV-RNA levels decreased to be undetectable at the 17th week and constantly negative thereafter. During the PEG-IFN therapy, flu-like symptoms and progression of anaemia were observed, which were treated by a transient cessation of PEG-IFN therapy for a couple of weeks and an increase in the dose of erythropoietin, respectively. The residual renal function remained stable during the course of 48 weeks (renal Kt/V; from 1.28 to 1.26). Six months after the end of the treatment, sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 52-year-old woman with a known liver cyst and gall stone disease presented with 1 week of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea without vomiting, anorexia, jaundice and itching. She presented similarly 6 years before. At that time, computed tomography (CT) scan was suspicious for hydatid cyst, and local hospital echinococcal antibodies were positive. However, sent-out repeat tests were negative. The patient denied contact with animals but did have multiple visits to Jerusalem. Given low epidemiology in the United States, negative repeat tests and low suspicion, the patient was scheduled to undergo hepatic cyst resection for diagnosis, but she was lost to follow-up. On this admission, the patient was afebrile and had scleral icterus with mildly jaundiced skin. Laboratory results revealed eosinophilia (white blood cell count of 7,200/\u00b5L with absolute eosinophil count of 710/\u00b5L, Hb of 14 g/dL and platelet count of 299,000/\u00b5L) with biliary pattern liver function tests that showed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 367 U/L with total bilirubin of 3.5 mg/dL and direct bilirubin of 3.0 mg/dL with elevated transaminases (aspartate transaminase (AST) 136 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 244 U/L). This time, echinococcal antibodies were positive for both local and sent-out ones. Ultrasound showed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis and calcified right hepatic cystic lesion. CT scan demonstrated large hepatic hypodense lesion with thick calcified rim (). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed hepatic cyst along with dilated central bile ducts and abrupt narrowing at the biliary confluence (). The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed mild stenosis in the upper third of the common bile duct (CBD) from external compression, and the copious mucus obtained through balloon sweeps showed scolices. Based on the presentation and workup, the patient was diagnosed with HLD concerning for cystobiliary fistula and was started on albendazole. The patient was scheduled for cholecystectomy and surgical cyst removal. Since the cyst was densely adherent to the right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava, radical resection was impractical. Therefore, she underwent partial cystectomy, cystobiliary fistula repair and omentoplasty. Subsequent intraoperative cholangiogram showed no leak (). However, 2 weeks after the surgery, the patient developed a refractory biliary leak for which aggressive endotherapy, necrosectomy procedures and cystobiliary fistula embolization failed (). The case was further complicated by hepatic abscess and colonic fistula that required multiple admissions and variable antibiotic courses, and for which the patient is planned to undergo percutaneous closure. Probable next step, per multidisciplinary team discussions, is right hepatectomy with or without Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and right hemicolectomy with diverting loop ileostomy.

    "question": "A 59-yr-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of continuous epigastric and right upper quadrant pain for the previous 3 weeks on 23th March, 2009. He had no history of hypertension or diabetes. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes every day for 40 yr and was a social drinker. He did not have any changes in bowel habit or hematochezia. The patient had undergone a gastrofiberoscopy and colonoscopy 20 days earlier in a local clinic. Endoscopic findings had revealed chronic gastritis and a polyp in the colon. Fatty liver had also been reported on the abdominal ultrasonography.\nThe patient had the persistent abdominal pain worsened during the last 3 days. He had focal rigidity and tenderness in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen. His initial vital signs were: blood pressure 110/60 mmHg, pulse rate 88/min, respiratory rate 20/min, and temperature 36.3\u2103. Six hours after presentation, he complained of chills with a high body temperature of 38.0\u2103. The complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 16,800/\u00b5L, hemoglobin concentration of 14.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 350,000/\u00b5L. Blood chemistry data revealed severe increases in C-reactive protein (346 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (55 mm/hr), with mildly elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (127 and 175 IU/L). Bilirubin, albumin, and other blood component chemistries were all within the normal range.\nPlain radiographs of the chest and abdomen were unremarkable. Pre-contrast and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an approximately 6.0 cm, ill-defined heterogeneous enhancing hypodense mass lesion in the gastrocolic ligament (). The mass extended to its peripheries, with ill-defined infiltration of the surrounding omentum. Radiologists called for further workup to differentiate among metastatic mass, primary omental tumor, and omental infarction.\nViral and tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigens, alpha-fetoproteins, CA 19-9, and CA 125, were within normal ranges. Gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy showed simple chronic gastritis. Abdominal ultrasonography displayed an ill-defined, heterogeneous echogenic mass between the stomach and transverse colon (). Further imaging with positron emission tomography CT revealed a large intense hypermetabolic mass in the gastrocolic ligaments without evidence of metastasis. An exploratory laparotomy was consequently performed under the impression of necrotic tumorous lesion.\nThe operative field revealed a 4-cm crab leg embedded within the approximately 6-cm abscess in the perforated antrum of the stomach (). Streptococcus sp. was cultured from the abscess. The patient underwent antrectomy, vagotomy, and transverse colon wedge resection. A detailed history taken after surgery uncovered the Kanjang-gaejang ingestion three weeks before, one day prior to the onset of abdominal pain. Twenty days after admission, the patient was discharged from the hospital with no complications. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 90-year-old male who presented with symptoms of general weakness and poor oral intake visited the emergency department of our hospital. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in our hospital. Abdominal computed tomography had been performed about one month previously and had revealed multiple viable HCCs in both lobes of the liver. Their largest diameter was 10.7 cm (). The patient's HCC was classified as stage B according to the Barcelona Clinic Cancer staging classification. He had undergone radio frequency thermal ablation (RFTA) once and TACE six times in our hospital. Two days ago he visited our outpatient clinic with symptoms such as general weakness, nausea, and vomiting. Because the symptoms had suggested adrenal insufficiency, he had been empirically administered prednisolone 10mg per day by the oral route for two days. ACTH stimulation test couldn't be performed at our outpatient clinic and the patient refused the test. Else he had been taking furosemide 20 mg, aldactone 50 mg a day. Before taking prednisolone, serum creatinine was 1.12 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 65 mL/min/1.73 m2, and his renal function had been well preserved considering his age.\nThe patient's vital signs were within normal limits at our emergency department. On physical examination, the abdomen was distended, without tenderness or rebound tenderness. A complete blood cell count showed mild leukocytosis with mild anemia: leukocytes, 14.4 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L; hemoglobin, 10.8 g/dL; and platelets, 180 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L. The following additional laboratory values were found: serum sodium, 145 mEq/L; potassium, 5.4 mEq/L; chloride 110 mEg/L; bicarbonate 24.0 mEq/L; total protein, 7.1 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL calcium, 8.7 mg/dL; inorganic phosphorus, 5.8 mg/dL. In addition, serum urea nitrogen level was 100.5 mg/dL, creatinine level was 3.00 mg/dL, eGFR was 21 mL/min/1.73 m2. AST was 310 U/L, ALT was 171 U/L, total bilirubin was 5.24 mg/dl, prothrombin time was 12.5 sec, \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) was 647.4 ng/mL. His Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 9. Chest radiography revealed only an old tuberculosis lesion in the right upper lung zone. His electrocardiogram was normal. Because he had acute kidney damage, and adequate hydration could not correct it, hepatorenal syndrome was suspected. He was treated by intravenous hydration at first, and was also administered terlipressin and albumin.\nThough serum uric acid was 8.0 mg/dL about 6 months ago, the following day, serum uric acid increased to 18.3 mg/dL. Serum sodium was 146 mEq/L, potassium was 5.4 mEq/L, inorganic phosphorus was 6.2 mg/dL, calcium was 8.7 mg/dL, serum urea nitrogen level was 104.6 mg/dL, creatinine level was 2.90 mg/dL, and eGFR was 22 mL/min/1.73 m2. Though oliguria was not present, his urine output was lower than a day earlier. Hydration and treatment for hepatorenal syndrome were maintained.\nIn next day, he had severe metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury. Multiple organ failure progressed steadily, and he expired three days after admission. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of multiple lung nodules. The patient had been living in an urban area of Korea. She denied any previous overseas travel history. The patient was seronegative for hepatitis B surface antigen, and for antibodies to hepatitis C, and HIV. She was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia 2 years before the admission, and had been receiving corticosteroid monotherapy of 20 mg/day prednisolone. The patient was admitted because a chest X-ray showed new nodular opacities in both lungs, compared with a chest X-ray taken 6 months ago (). She did not report cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, or pleuritic chest pain. She denied fever, night sweats, anorexia, or weight loss. Body temperature was 36.8\u2103, respiratory rate was 18/min, and blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg. The chest was clear to auscultation. The laboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin, 11.7 g/dL; white blood cell count, 6230/uL (88.4% neutrophils, 5.9% lymphocytes); platelet count, 152000/\u00b5L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 12 mm/hr; C-reactive protein, 11.94 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 23 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.87 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 15 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 19 IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.61 mg/dL; and reticulocyte count, 4.39%. Blood and sputum cultures were negative for any pyogenic bacteria. Sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli by smear. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed multiple ill-defined consolidations and cavitations in all lobes of both lungs with the absence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy (). The patient underwent a CT-guided lung biopsy. A histopathology study revealed many oval shaped, budding yeast-form fungal micro-organisms in the cytoplasm of CD68(+) alveolar macrophages (), which was clearly identified by Periodic acid-Schiff and Gomori Methenamine Silver stains. The patient was diagnosed with chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis. Therapy was initiated with 200 mg itraconazole orally three times per day for 3 days and maintained with 200 mg orally twice per day for 12 months. She was well following treatment, and the follow-up chest X-ray taken 1 year later revealed complete resolution (). What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 16-year-old female patient presented with a history of fever, joint pains, amenorrhea and generalized body swelling since 6 months. Fever was of high grade, intermittent in nature, associated with erythematous rashes which were localized to the upper trunk and back. Joint pains mainly involved the elbow and knee joints, and were associated with redness and swelling restricting movement. There was a history of recurrent oral ulcers, decreased appetite and significant weight loss. There was no history of urinary disturbances, bleeding tendencies, abdominal distension, altered bowel habits, altered mentation, photosensitivity or bluish discoloration of skin/mucous membranes. There was no past history of delayed developmental milestones, blood transfusions, diabetes, or thy. There was no family thyroid disease or any other chronic illness. No family member suffered from a similar disease.\nOn general examination, the patient was febrile with an oral temperature of 39.6\u00b0C. Vitals were within normal limits. Pallor, pedal edema and facial puffiness were evident. There were enlarged, non-tender, mobile lymph nodes present in the cervical region. Erythematous, non-tender, non-blanchable rashes were present over the chest and upper back (). Per abdomen examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system examination was essentially normal. On musculoskeletal examination, the patient had tenderness over bilateral hip joints, knee joints and small joints of hands (proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints) associated with swelling and redness.\nOn the day of patient admission the laboratory investigations revealed some abnormalities including anemia with hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dl, leukopenia with a leukocyte count of 3000/mm3, and platelet count of 150 \u00d7 103/\u00b5l. Renal function parameters were normal with blood urea of 18 mg/dl (10\u201350), serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dl (0.7\u20131.3), serum uric acid 5.1 mg/dl (4\u20137), serum calcium 7.9 mg/dl (8.5\u201310.5) and serum phosphate 3.4 mg/dl (2.5\u20134.5). Random blood sugar of the patient was 93 mg/dl. Liver function tests were slightly deranged, with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 60 U/l (up to 40), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 79 U/l (up to 40), serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) 243 U/l (30\u2013117), total serum bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl (0.2\u20130.8) and serum total protein 6 g/dl. The lipid profile was within the normal range. Anemia work-up showed MCV (mean corpuscular volume) of 125.4 fl/cell, MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin) 37.3 pg/cell, and MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) 30.1 g/dl, revealing a macrocytic picture. The corrected reticulocyte count was 0.16% and the serum ferritin level was 1144.6 \u00b5g/l.\nDirect and indirect Coombs\u2019 tests were negative, and hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was raised with a value of 140 mm/1st hour. The serum fibrinogen level was 280 mg/dl. Additional investigations included raised C-reactive protein (CRP; 100 mg/dl), negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA), negative rheumatoid factor (RF) and negative anti-dsDNA. Anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies, anti-SS-B/La antibodies and HLA-B27 were negative. To rule out infectious causes of fever a series of tests was performed: the malaria card test, Widal test, serology for Leptospira, Leishmania and scrub typhus, blood and urine cultures, Mantoux test, HIV antibodies, Hbs-antigen and anti-HCV antibodies. We also performed a heterophile test for Epstein-Barr virus infection and excluded presence of antibodies in IgM/IgG class to parvovirus B19 and autoantibodies for cytomegalovirus. None of the performed tests confirmed viral or bacterial infection.\nEye examination was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and presence of free fluid. Echocardiography was normal. Lymph node biopsy showed diffuse follicular hyperplasia which suggested a chronic inflammatory state. Bone marrow aspiration revealed megaloblastic erythropoiesis. Minor salivary gland biopsy was undertaken to exclude Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but there were no typical inflammatory infiltrates. Radiological investigations included X-ray of chest, hands and knees and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac spine, which were normal (, ).\nIn view of the patient being a 16-year-old female with a history of fever, polyarthritis and rash, examination revealing hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, and investigations showing high ESR and ferritin values, with absence of ANA and RF, a possible diagnosis of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis was established.\nAs the patient had moderate to high grade fever, generalized edema, swollen and tender joints, and poor general condition, a possible association of JIA with MAS was suspected. The presence of ferritin > 684 ng/ml, platelet count of \u2264 181 \u00d7 109/l, AST level 79 U/l and serum fibrinogen level of 280 mg/dl satisfied the 2016 criteria for classification of MAS in sJIA, and hence the diagnosis was made.\nDuring the course of hospital stay, the patient received anti-inflammatory therapy, blood transfusions, glucocorticoids and methotrexate. The patient recovered dramatically within a span of two weeks. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 64-year-old white male retired military intelligence officer had a 6-year history of cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection when he was admitted to a referral hospital for liver transplant evaluation. His HBV infection was thought most likely contracted in 13 years of military service in the Orient in the era of the cold war between capitalist and communist countries. The patient had no history of alcohol use, smoking or transfusions. The patient had a son, age 40, who had chronic hepatitis with negative serology for viral etiologies; the son had hyperpigmented skin and may have had elevated serum iron (according to family), but not diabetes mellitus. The patient had diabetes mellitus diagnosed 18 months ago and treated with oral hypoglycemic agents until 6 months ago when insulin therapy became necessary. He had an esophageal variceal hemorrhage 6 years ago treated with sclerotherapy and a splenocaval shunt. He had been experiencing increasing lethargy, confusion and easy bruising, starting 6 months ago. The patient developed jaundice, fatigue, poor oral intake, weakness, lethargy and mildly slurred speech, despite treatment with lactulose, spironolactone and omeprazole.\nOn admission, the patient was lethargic, with mildly slurred speech. His skin was markedly jaundiced. His temperature was 36.4o C, pulse 82/minute, blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg and respirations 16/minute. His chest was clear with no cardiac abnormalities noted. He had 2+ leg edema. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm and nonspecific T-wave changes. Chest radiograph showed moderate cardiomegaly and no pulmonary abnormalities. The patient\u2019s bilirubin was 15 mg/dL (reference range [RR]: 0.3-1.5 mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 119 U/L (RR: <40 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 222 U/L (RR: <40 U/L), gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) 53 U/L (RR: <30 U/L), albumin 1.8 g/dL (RR: 3.5-5 g/dL), ammonia 74 umol/L (RR: 10-47 umol/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dL (RR: 9-20 mg/dL), creatinine 1.0 mg/dL (RR: 0.8-1.5 mg/dL), glucose 361 mg/dL (RR: 70-110 mg/dL), hemoglobin (Hgb) 11.1 g/dL (RR: 12.9-16.9 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 102.4 fL (RR: 80-100 fL), white blood cell (WBC) count 15,500/mm3 (RR: 4,000-10,000/mm3) (80% segmented neutrophils, 3% bands, 9% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes, 1% atypical lymphocytes), platelet count 102,000/mm3 (RR: 140,000-440,000/mm3), prothrombin time (PT) 21 seconds (RR: 10.5-13 seconds) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 48.4 seconds (RR: 25-33 seconds).\nThe results of blood testing more specifically for liver transplant evaluation returned later, showing: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, anti-HBsAg antibodies negative, anti-hepatitis B core antibodies positive, HBV e antigen negative, anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies positive (IgM negative), anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies negative, anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies >120 U/L (IgM negative), antinuclear antibodies positive at a titer of 1:40 (speckled pattern), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 14.8 ng/mL (RR: <5 ng/mL), zinc 0.16 mcg/mL (RR: 0.55-1.5 mcg/mL), iron 106 mcg/dL (RR: 65-165 mcg/dL), iron binding capacity 107 mcg/dL (RR: 250-420 mcg/dL) and ferritin 4392 ng/mL (RR: 10-282 ng/mL).\nThe patient was treated with lactulose, neomycin, spironolactone, omeprazole and insulin. On hospital day 2, his WBC count was 19,800/mm3, glucose 338 mg/dL and ammonia 78 umol/L. Pulmonary function testing showed a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 2.34 L (88% of predicted), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.69 L (71% of predicted) and diffusing capacity of 19.9 mL/min/mm Hg (92% of predicted). Urine culture yielded Enterococcus faecalis, 50,000 colonies/mL. The patient remained afebrile, but that evening, he had increased lethargy and encephalopathy. His ammonia level rose acutely to 197 umol/L. His lactulose and neomycin were increased.\nOn day 3, the patient\u2019s ammonia was 45 umol/L; he had brief episodes of atrial tachycardia. ECG showed sinus rhythm and nonspecific T-wave changes. Chest x-ray showed mild bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema and a left pleural effusion. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, but mild mitral regurgitation. Over the next 3 days, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but had increasing jaundice. On day 6, he complained of dyspnea on exertion as well as feeling tired, weak and sleepy. He was afebrile. His WBC count rose to 31,900/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils, 5% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes).\nOn day 8, the patient was lethargic and slightly confused. His ammonia was 60 umol/L, bilirubin 25.5 mg/dL, albumin 2.2 g/dL, ALT 109 U/L, BUN 26 mg/dL and creatinine 2.5 mg/dL. He was given prednisone and zinc. Over the next 3 days, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but had increasing bilirubin, BUN and creatinine. He developed fine bibasilar pulmonary crackles with moderate pulmonary edema, along with left pleural effusion and cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, which was treated with furosemide. On day 12, the patient\u2019s mental status had slowly deteriorated. His ammonia was 31 umol/L, bilirubin 37.5 mg/dL, ALT 71 U/L, GGT 55 U/L, BUN 60 mg/dL, creatinine 4.9 mg/dL and chest x-ray unchanged. Adenosine thallium cardiac scan showed fixed defects in anterior and lateral left ventricle. He was given bumetanide and metolazone. At 15:00, his blood pressure fell to 82/48 mm Hg, with heart rate 60/minute and respirations 16/minute. At 16:15, he developed sinus bradycardia (rate 50/minute). At 16:20, arterial blood showed pH 7.37, PCO2 29 mm Hg and PO2 32 mm Hg (on room air). With 100% oxygen via facemask, his PO2 improved to 63 mm Hg, with PCO2 35 mm Hg and pH 7.35. His blood pressure increased to 113/48 mm Hg at 20:00.\nOn day 13 at 00:05, chest radiograph showed decreased pulmonary edema. At 01:15, he was afebrile, but his blood pressure decreased to 89/43 mm Hg and an infusion of dopamine was initiated. At 03:00, emergency hemodialysis was started. At 03:20, the patient\u2019s WBC count was 57,500/mm3, Hgb 10.1 g/dL, platelets 94,000/mm3, PT 20 seconds, sodium 132 mEq/L (RR: 136-145 mEq/L), potassium 3.6 mEq/L (RR: 3.5-5.1 mEq/L), chloride 97 mEq/L (RR: 95-110 mEq/L), bicarbonate 26 mEq/L (RR: 21-31 mEq/L), calcium 10.6 mg/dL (RR: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL), phosphorus 4.1 mg/dL (RR: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL), glucose 115 mg/dL, BUN 40 mg/dL, creatinine 3.7 mg/dL, ammonia 45 umol/L, ALT 121 U/L, AST 469 U/L, GGT 62 U/L and bilirubin 42 mg/dL. At 05:15, he developed labored breathing, with arterial pH 7.36, PCO2 36 mm Hg and PO2 38 mm Hg on 100% oxygen via facemask. Manual ventilation was started. He developed bradycardia with blood pressure 70/30 mm Hg. The patient then suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and could not be resuscitated.

    "question": "A 73-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic alcohol use presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever, melena, and intermittent episodes of confusion. The patient was admitted to the hospital seven weeks prior to this admission for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His course was complicated by a right hepatic artery injury treated with ligation and clipping, with subsequent development of multiple hepatic abscesses, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecium bacteremia, and a bile leak. The bile leak required treatment with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and a common bile duct (CBD) stent placement. The patient was discharged to rehab with a Jackson Pratt (JP) drain (Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ohio) in place. He was continued on daptomycin and ertapenem for four weeks for hepatic abscesses per the infectious disease specialist. The patient returned to the hospital for recurrent fevers and melena. History was limited due to acute delirium but right upper quadrant abdominal pain was noted. He denied bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. His JP drain had a recorded output of approximately 30-40 cc/day.\nThe patient was febrile with a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit within a few hours of admission. Other vital signs were significant for sinus tachycardia, with 110 beats per minute, and tachypnea, with 22 breaths per minute. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation were at 154/65 and 100% on room air, respectively. The physical exam was notable for confusion, abdominal tenderness to palpation that was worse in the right upper quadrant, and the JP drain in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory findings on admission were significant for leukocytosis, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of up to 13,200/mm3. His hemoglobin and hematocrit were noted to be at 6.2 gm/dL and 19%, respectively, which was decreased from the hemoglobin of 10.3 gm/dL on the day of his last discharge. Platelets on admission were within normal limits at 213,000/mm3. His comprehensive metabolic panel from admission revealed transaminitis, with an elevated aspartate aminotransferase of 149 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 134 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase at 51 0U/L. There was no significant elevation of total bilirubin. The patient's prothrombin time was elevated to 16.1 seconds, and the international normalized ratio INR was 1.41 on admission.\nOn day one, the patient became hemodynamically unstable, with worsening mentation, tachycardia, and tachypnea, requiring a transfer to the intensive care unit. Surgery and gastrointestinal medicine were consulted for evaluation. The patient underwent imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed persistent postsurgical changes of cholecystectomy and an unchanged common bile duct stent. A right-sided abdominal drain was noted to be in the right upper quadrant. Multilobulated, predominantly hypoattenuating masses were noted throughout the liver, with persistent hyperdensity, more centrally suggestive of combined multifocal hepatic abscess and central hemorrhage, also reported. He was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and resuscitated with intravenous (IV) lactated ringer fluids. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nHe was taken for an esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD) to assess for causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). This did not show any evidence of active bleeding or hemobilia at the previous sphincterotomy site; however, the patient had significant melena noted at the end of the exam and was emergently taken for further evaluation with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). CTA revealed transient hyperdensity within the right lobe of the liver, adjacent to the right portal vein, suspicious for a hepatic artery injury/pseudoaneurysm as seen in Figure .\nFigure shows CTA findings of the clipped right hepatic artery from the patient's initial surgery.\nHe was then taken for visceral angiography by interventional radiography (IR), which confirmed a previous iatrogenic hepatic artery ligation and showed an arterial enhancing structure within the central aspect of the liver consistent with a hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm, as seen in Figure and Figure .\nThe patient\u2019s pseudoaneurysm was not amenable to catheter-directed embolization, as there was no direct feeding arterial structure identified. He was subsequently taken to the operating room for a right hepatectomy. Post right hepatectomy, the patient remained tenuous and began to decline quickly after developing acute oliguric renal failure, which required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and resistant hypoglycemia. Additionally, worsening shock required pressure and, ultimately, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Due to the patient\u2019s acute decompensation and prolonged hospital course, his wife elected to move toward comfort care and withdrawal of aggressive measures.

    "question": "A 30-year-old female with acute hepatitis was referred to our hospital in 1995. She had been asymptomatic until the disease onset. She had no history of significant medical condition, blood transfusion, or daily intake of medicine and did not consume alcohol. Her serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level had fluctuated from 300 to 1116 IU/L for 3 months before admission. On admission, laboratory examinations revealed total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase (AST) 842 IU/L, ALT 956 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 153 IU/L, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase 68 IU/L, \u03b3-globulin 2.3 g/dL, and immunoglobulin G 2,710 mg/dL. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative, antinuclear antibody was weakly positive (1:40, homogeneous), anti-smooth muscle antibody was positive (1:320), and anti-mitochondrial antibody was negative. Human leukocyte antigen was positive for DR-4. Histological analysis of the liver revealed marked interface hepatitis with rosette formation in the parenchyma. On the basis of these findings, she was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and started on prednisolone (30 mg/day). Her serum ALT level gradually declined. Her prednisolone dose was tapered to 10\u201315 mg/day, which was administered with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA; 600 mg/day) to maintain her ALT level <40 IU/L. Since 2002, she had been treated by a doctor at home, and the aforementioned regimen was continued. In 2008, she developed steroid-induced cataract and was referred to our hospital to consult about treatment options for autoimmune hepatitis. At the time of referral, she was 150 cm in height and weighed 43.5 kg (body mass index 19.3 kg/m2), and she was being administered 12.5 mg/day of prednisolone and 600 mg/day of UDCA, and her serum AST and ALT levels were 23 and 34 IU/L, respectively. We added azathioprine (100 mg/day) to this regimen and gradually tapered the prednisolone dose to 10 mg/day; her ALT level was maintained between 22 and 40 IU/L with occasional mild flare-ups. In May 2012, she complained shortness of breath and easy fatigability and significant pallor was noted on physical examination. A hemogram revealed hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL, mean red cell volume 117.3 fL, reticulocyte count 0.6 %, white blood cell count 2,600 cells/\u03bcL, and platelet count 207,000 cells/\u03bcL. Laboratory serum analyses revealed total protein 6.0 g/dL, albumin 3.7 g/dL, AST 32 IU/L, ALT 42 IU/L, lactic acid dehydrogenase 221 IU/L, and normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Her serum iron level was 214 \u03bcg/dL, erythropoietin level was 3,750 mIU (normal 9.1\u201332.8 mIU), and vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were 307 pg/mL (normal 233\u2013914 pg/mL) and 3.3 ng/mL (normal 3.6\u201312.9 ng/mL), respectively. She showed no symptoms of recent infection, such as fever or myalgia, and gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no evidence of hemorrhagic lesions. She was initially suspected of having azathioprine-induced anemia; therefore, azathioprine was discontinued. A red cell transfusion was performed, which increased her hemoglobin level to 8.3 g/dL; however, after 4 weeks, her hemoglobin levels decreased to 6.1 g/dL (Fig. ). Another transfusion was performed; however, severe anemia kept recurring and repeat transfusions were required. Her reticulocyte count was consistently low (0.2\u20130.6 %) except just after transfusion. In July 2012, bone marrow aspiration was performed, which revealed hypocellular bone marrow with an absence of erythroblasts. Giant proerythroblast was not observed and her serum was negative for immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody to parvovirus B19, although viral DNA was not examined. Therefore, she was diagnosed with acquired PRCA on the basis of these findings, and CsA was administered on September 2012 at an initial dose of 6 mg/kg/day (250 mg/day). After 7 weeks, her hemoglobin level and reticulocyte count both showed considerable improvement (12.4 g/dL and 2.4 %, respectively). The CsA dose was gradually reduced and maintained at 1.6 mg/kg/day (70 mg/day) since April 2013, without relapse of anemia. Her cyclosporine trough blood level has ranged from 69 to 88 ng/mL. In October 2012, UDCA was discontinued and the prednisolone dose was tapered to 9 mg/day; prednisolone has been maintained at 8 mg/day since January 2013. The mild fluctuations in serum AST and ALT levels noted after azathioprine discontinuation ceased after initiating CsA therapy. Her AST and ALT levels have remained <20 IU/L for 8 months since the initiation of therapy. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman was referred to the emergency department with complaints of icterus, nocturnal fever, arthralgia, and abdominal pain. The patient had been well until two weeks earlier, when symptoms developed. She was a farmer in a village and owned a lot of sheep. There were no allergies and no history of recent use of drugs but she was consuming a large amount of nonpasteurized traditional cheese.\nOn physical examination, the patient was nonedematous. Her temperature was 38.5\u00b0C, with a blood pressure of 70/45 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 70 beats per minute, and respirations of 18 per minute. The oxygen saturation was 96 percent while she was breathing room air.\nThe liver edge was palpable 5 cm below the costovertebral margin. Her right upper quadrant of abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation. Additionally, there was marginal splenomegaly. The heart sounds and the results of the remainder of the examination were normal.\nLaboratory studies performed at admission revealed a WBC count of 5400 cells/mm\u00b3, a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, a platelet count of 216.000 platelets/mm\u00b3, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 224 U/L, an alanine aminostransferase of 159 U/L, an alkaline phosphatase level of 2340 U/L, a gamma glutamyl transferase level of 597 U/L, a direct bilirubin level of 3.1 mg/dL, an albumin level of 3.3 g/dL, a globulin level of 4.3 g/dL and a uric acid level of 1.4 g/dL. Serum pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal function tests were in normal ranges.\nHer other laboratory parameters included erythrocyte sedimentation rate 47 mm/hr, C-Reactive Protein level 26 U/L, serum sodium level 124 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, chloride 95 mmol/L, and plasma osmolality 262 mmol/kg/H2O. Urine biochemistry showed osmolality 274 mmol/kg/H2O and urinary sodium 64 mmol/L. Serologic tests for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis viruses were negative. Electrocardiographic examination showed minimal ST-T elevations.\nUltrasonography and Computed Tomography scan (CT scan) of the abdomen showed a small pericardial effusion with mild splenomegaly and hepatomegaly (Figures and ). However, there was no evidence of biliary dilatation or cholecystitis. CT scan of thorax and brain revealed no abnormality. Echocardiography detected mild pericardial effusion without cardiac dysfunction.\nAt the next day, serum agglutination test for Brucella was positive and its titer was 1/1240. The diagnosis of SIADH in association with cholestatic hepatitis and pericardial effusion due to Brucellosis was made. After intramuscular streptomycin (1000 mg/day for 20 days) with oral Doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 6 weeks), the patient's symptoms, cholestasis, pericardial effusion, and hyponatremia resolved dramatically.

    "question": "A 68-year-old man was referred for evaluation of a hepatic mass. He had history of hepatitis B virus carrier for 20 years and liver cirrhosis for 3 years. He has been taking an angiotensin receptor blocker and digoxin due to hypertension and heart failure. He has suffered from repeated episodes of epistaxis from his teens and gastrointestinal bleeding from his mid-thirties. All of his five children also had the history of recurrent epistaxis. Also his sister was suffering from the sequelae of cerebrovascular accident. On physical examination, several telangiectatic macular lesions were found on his arms and trunk (). The laboratory work-up at first visit revealed the following: WBC, 4.6\u00d7103/mm3; platelet, 172\u00d7103/mm3; hemoglobin, 12.6 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 42 IU/L; alanine aminotranferase (ALT), 20 IU/L; hepatitis B virus surface antigen, positive; hepatitis B surface antibody, negative; anti-hepatitis C virus antibody, negative; and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), 345 ng/mL (normal, 0-20). Other laboratory results including bleeding time, coagulation time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were normal. Gastroduodenal endoscopy disclosed a telangiectasia at the lesser curvature in mid-body of the stomach (). Liver dynamic CT (LDCT) revealed multiple HCCs in the right lobe of liver and there was no evidence of distant metastasis or vascular invasion. The HCC lesions showed heterogenous wash-out compared to well enhancing round homogenous AVMs in delayed phase of LDCT ().\nLiver transplantation was recommended, however, the patient refused it due to economic problem. TACE was performed in three consecutive sessions, but lipiodol uptake in the tumor mass was very poor at every session. HCC progressed after each TACE session. Fever developed up to 38\u2103, and AST and/or ALT increased more than two times of baseline following the first two TACE sessions.\nBecause of unusual TACE effect, we reviewed all the radiologic images of the patient and found an enlarged tortuous hepatic artery, multiple arteriovenous malformations, and early visualization of hepatic veins in LDCT () and hepatic angiography (). Based on these findings and positive family history, he was diagnosed as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease and genetic tests for the ENG and ACVRL1 were performed. Patient's genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using the QuickGene DNA blood kit (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and BigDye Terminatore V3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA). Fourteen and ten exons and their intronic flanking sequences of the ENG and ACVRL1, respectively, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with appropriate primers ( and ). The molecular genetic analysis for the whole exons with their flanking sequences of the ENG was negative. However, the patient harbors a deletion mutation, c.145del (p.Ala49ProfsX5), in the ACVRL, the diagnosis of HHT type 2 with hepatic involvement was confirmed by the results of genetic study. He is waiting for deceased donor liver transplantation for the treatment of HCC. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 60-year-old woman was hospitalized for a week-long history of progressive dyspnea and general weakness. She had a medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She had ingested approximate 14 g/day of alcohol for 20 years. She was acutely ill-looking and had an alert mental status. Upon admission, her vital signs included a blood pressure of 132/80 mmHg, pulse of 76/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and body temperature of 36.8\u00b0C. Decreased breathing sounds and dullness to percussion were evident over the lower one-third of the right hemithorax. No friction rub was auscultated. Heart sounds were regular and there was no murmur. The liver and spleen were not palpated. Palmar erythema, vascular spider, and peripheral edema were absent.\nInitial laboratory data revealed albumin 3.2 g/dL, total protein 6.4 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 229 IU/L, aspartate transaminase/alanine aminotransferase of 33/24 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase of 801 IU/L, total bilirubin of 0.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine of 12.5/0.89 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 3430/mm3, hematocrit of 38.4%, platelet count of 150,000/mm3, prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) of 1.08, C-reactive protein of 0.07 mg/dL, and blood analysis of N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 257 ng/mL. Urinalysis revealed no proteinuria. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody were not detected.\nChest X-ray showed a significant right-sided pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was performed and 1500 mL of the pleural effusion was drained. The pleural fluid was yellowish, and an analysis revealed a pH of 7.3, glucose of 212 mg/dL, LDH of 105 IU/L, protein of 3.0 g/dL, red blood cell count of 330/mm3, WBC count of 1/mm3, adenosine deaminase of 11.9 IU/L, and carcinoembryonic antigen of 2.5 mg/mL. Pleural fluid was transudate. Culture for bacteria as well as an acid-fast bacillus smear and culture were negative. No malignant cells were observed.\nA chest computed tomography scan revealed no parenchymal lung disease or pleural thickening. On abdominal ultrasonography, the liver size and contour were within the normal range without evidence of ascites, but the liver parenchymal echogenicity was slightly increased, which was suggestive of fatty liver. We also performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed gastric erosion but no esophageal varices. Echocardiography revealed no evidence of cardiac disease.\nWe repeated the thoracentesis every 3 days for 2 weeks and empirically prescribed diuretics. The collected fluids were also transudate, but the right-sided pleural effusion was not improved.\nAlthough laboratory findings and abdominal ultrasonography did not show the evidence of liver cirrhosis, due to her alcoholic history, we performed an examination using a transient elastography, which can measure liver stiffness. The transient elastography result was 35.3 Kpa, which was suggestive of liver cirrhosis. Accordingly, we suspected a hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites. A radioisotope 99mTc-sulfur colloid injected in peritoneal cavity resulted in a positive uptake of radioactivity within the right pleural cavity (Fig. \n). This finding suggested that the pleural effusion originated in the peritoneal cavity and that there was a diaphragmatic defect.\nWe diagnosed the patient as having hepatic hydrothorax without ascites, which was the first sign of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Once the patient was started on a strict low salt diet and a water restriction with diuretics, the pleural effusion slowly regressed. After 2 months of treatment, the hydrothorax was resolved.

She presented to her next appointment eight days later with complaints of fevers with chills, night sweats, lethargy, headaches, myalgias, nausea, anorexia, left-sided pleuritic chest pain and multiple episodes of watery, non-bloody diarrhea. She was directed to the emergency department for further evaluation.\nShe denied sick contacts, recent travel, medication changes or medication non-compliance. At the time of admission, she was on prednisone 5 mg PO (oral) QD, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 360 mg PO QID, tacrolimus 0.5 mg PO BID.\nHer vitals on admission were significant for temperature 101.7 F, heart rate 100/minute, blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, respirations 18/minute and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Physical exam revealed no acute abnormalities.\nAdmission labs were significant for white blood cell (WBC) 2,070/mm3 [normal range (N): 3,800-10,500/mm3], absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1,865/mm3 [N: 1,800-7,400/mm3], lymphocyte count 500/mm3 [N: 1,000-3,300/mm3], platelets 108,000/mm3 [N: 150,000-400,00/mm3], aspartate transaminase (AST) 81 U/l [N: 10-40 U/l], alanine transaminase (ALT) 87 U/l [N: 10-45 U/l], alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 137 U/l [N: 40-120 U/l] and normal renal function. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with no acute changes. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) ruled out the presence of pneumonia. Abdominal ultrasound showed polycystic liver and kidneys, contracted gallbladder with negative sonographic Murphy\u2019s sign. CT of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed polycystic liver and kidneys, as well as mural thickening of ascending colon with mild surrounding inflammatory changes (suggestive of colitis) (Figures , ).\nUrinalysis was not suggestive of infection. Respiratory viral panel multiplex test was negative. Clostridium difficile toxin test was negative. Stool cultures were negative. Stool microscopy was negative for ova and parasites. Urine cultures revealed Escherichia coli (10,000-49,000 CFU/ml) combined with normal urogenital flora. Blood cultures revealed no growth. Testing for acute hepatitis A, B and C viruses was negative. Epstein-Barr virus serology revealed prior infection. BK virus DNA, Parvovirus B19 DNA and adenovirus DNA were not detected by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.\nInfectious diseases service was consulted. Given the presence of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis and multi-systemic symptoms, there was concern for an ongoing viral process. She was started on valganciclovir 900 mg PO BID for presumed CMV disease, with intravenous fluid support. The E. coli in the urine was thought to be a colonization and she was successfully monitored off antibiotics.\nShe continued to have persistent fevers and diarrhea, with worsening leukopenia (lowest WBC count 1700/mm3 with lowest ANC 800/mm3), thrombocytopenia (nadir 86,000/mm3) and liver function abnormalities (AST 139 U/l, ALT 135 U/l, ALP 167 U/l). Given the persistent symptoms and worsening laboratory parameters, MMF was discontinued. Serum CMV PCR testing revealed 154,697 IU/ml (5.19 log10 IU/ml) [lower limit of assay detection 60 IU/ml (1.78 log10 IU/ml)]. Gastroenterology service was consulted for worsening liver function abnormalities and they attributed the clinical picture to systemic CMV infection.\nShe had clinical improvement, with improving CMV PCR tests [504 IU/ml (2.70 log10 IU/ml)] after 12 days of antiviral therapy. She was discharged on the twelfth day of hospital stay, with recovery of WBC count to 5,600/mm3 and platelets 147,000/mm3.\nShe was followed up by in the outpatient transplant nephrology and infectious diseases clinics. CMV PCR was negative 60 days after initiation of antiviral therapy and she was restarted on a lower dose of MMF.

    "question": "We report the case of a 58-year-old female with a personal history of diabetes mellitus diagnosed 8 years prior, treated with metformin and glibenclamide, a surgical history of two cesarean sections, without complications, and a family history of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and cholangiocarcinoma. She was referred to our hospital in November 2015 presenting nausea, vomiting, black stools, and diffuse and sporadic epigastric pain; she also lost 4 kg in 4 months, from 65 to 61 kg, which means a total of 7% weight loss, and showed signs of digestive tract bleeding and anemic syndrome. Serological studies, prior to hospital arrival, showed hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL.\nInitial laboratory results included leukocytes 8,260 \u03bc/L, hemoglobin 10.56 g/dL, platelets 222,000 \u03bc/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase 22 \u03bc/L, lactate dehydrogenase 207 \u03bc/L, alkaline phosphatase 71 \u03bc/L, AST 15 \u03bc/L, ALT 13 \u03bc/L, prothrombin time 6.7 s, serum albumin 3.5 g/dL, glucose 185 mg/dL, urea 26.9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated to 114.56 UI.\nThe approach protocol started with panendoscopy, showing body and fundus gastropathy and presence of Helicobacter pylori. Four months later, a colonoscopy was performed which revealed a right colonic tumor.\nAn abdominal CT scan followed, which revealed the following: liver with hypodense tumor, with regular edges, in segment V, 24 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 16 mm, and longitudinal thickening of 82 mm with a reduction of 100% of the intestinal lumen (Fig. ). PET CT showed a nodular lesion of 25 \u00d7 21 mm in segment V with maximum SUV of 17.1, a poorly defined lesion in segment VI of 11 mm in diameter, and maximum SUV of 6; ascending colon of 45 cm3 with maximum SUV of 51.4 (Fig. ).\nAn open surgical procedure was performed in May 2016 with right hemicolectomy with ileorectal mechanical anastomosis and hepatic bisegmentectomy V and VI (Fig. ). The duration of the surgical procedure was 4 h, with a 6 h anesthetic time, and total estimated bleeding was 900 mL. The oral feeding started 24 h after the procedure, presenting intestinal gas release at 24 h and evacuations at 48 h. Total intrahospital stay was 5 days, presenting right axillary vein thrombosis due to placement of central venous catheter guided by interventional radiology.\nThe histological diagnosis was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, intestinal type, with cecum, ascending colon, and appendicular involvement; free surgical margins (R0), nodules 2/11; hepatic lesions with neoplastic cells (Fig. ).\nThe postoperative stay was uneventful while the patient received chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin. The patient showed carcinoembryonic antigen 3.93 UI without tumor activity by CT. ECOG was 0 and IK was 1000 during the follow-up time of 9 months. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 20-year-old nonalcoholic, nonsmoker Nepalese man with no significant past medical history presented to the outpatient department with melena for 10 days. This was associated with fatigue and generalized weakness of the body. He denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or recent weight loss. He also gave a history of low-grade fever with an evening rise of temperature for the same duration. It was not associated with chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, runny nose, watery eyes, or sore throat. He had no history of similar illness in the past or any recent sick contacts. His family history was unremarkable.\nVitals on presentation revealed blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 120/min, respiratory rate 24/min, and temperature 100.5\u00b0F. On physical examination, he was pale and icteric. There were no edema, ecchymosis, or any palpable lymph nodes. Chest auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds over the right infrascapular region. The rest of the systemic examination was normal.\nBlood investigations showed hemoglobin (Hb) 5.3 g/dL and white blood cells (WBC) 5400/mm3 with neutrophils 79% and lymphocytes 18%, and platelets 319 000/mm3. His renal function tests showed urea 4.5 mmol/L and creatinine 95 \u03bcmol/L. Liver function test (LFT) showed total bilirubin 66 \u03bcmol/L, direct bilirubin 7 \u03bcmol/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 23 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 38 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 161 U/L. His lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated to 1450 U/L. Direct Coombs test was positive for antibodies against red blood cells.\nSerologies were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Serological evaluation for antinuclear antibody (ANA), antidouble-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody (ds-DNA), and anti\u2013smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) were negative. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. A presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia was made, and the patient was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily.\nDue to the presenting complaint of melena, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done, which revealed a peptic ulcer in the first part of the duodenum. A tissue sample was taken during endoscopy, which did not reveal Helicobacter pylori. He was treated with proton pump inhibitors for his peptic ulcer disease.\nMeanwhile, a chest X-ray showed right-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). The pleural fluid analysis showed an exudative pleural effusion with lymphocyte predominance, lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio of 4, and high adenosine deaminase activity (89 units/L). Computed tomography scan (CT) of the chest with and without contrast showed multiple centriacinar nodules giving tree in bud appearance, fibrotic changes in the right upper lobe, and moderate right-sided pleural effusion suggestive of tubercular pathology. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was not visualized in the microscopic analysis of the sputum. However, due to high clinical suspicion, corroborative pleural fluid analysis and chest imaging findings, he was started on antitubercular treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\nFollow-up laboratories showed Hb stable at 5-7 g/dL. Platelet count decreased to 127 000/mm3 at the time of discharge (Figure ). Following discharge on antitubercular medications and prednisone, he was lost to follow up.\nThe patient presented to our clinic after 3 months following an exacerbation of his symptoms after the inadvertent stopping of his prednisone. He presented with increased fatigue, generalized weakness, and jaundice. He had no preceding upper respiratory tract symptoms. Blood investigation this time showed Hb: 4 g/dL, WBC: 6500/mm3, and platelets: 10 000/mm3. LFT showed total bilirubin: 48.05 \u03bcmol/L and direct bilirubin: 13.51 \u03bcmol/L. LDH was elevated to 851 U/L.\nThe development of thrombocytopenia in a patient with pre-existing autoimmune hemolytic anemia led us to consider the possibility of Evans syndrome as the cause of bicytopenia. He was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g once daily for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone 60 mg daily. However, there was no improvement in his Hb or platelet count. We considered other immunosuppressive therapies like intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, and cyclosporine as possible treatment options, but we faced two challenges with their use: fear of reactivation of TB and the prohibitive cost. Eventually, we decided to start him on cyclosporine, given its affordable cost despite the risk of reactivation of TB. He was discharged on oral cyclosporine 10 mg daily for a month. Unfortunately, he was again lost to follow up. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 32-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of bilateral feet numbness. The patient stated that he had consumed alcohol the evening prior to the presentation, and upon awakening the next morning, he had been unable to bear weight on lower extremities. He admitted to decreased sensation bilaterally, which extended from the foot to the ankle, more pronounced on the right side. Furthermore, the patient had a 7/10 dull pain sensation radiating from the lower back to bilateral lower extremities as well as generalized body aches. It was the progressive worsening of his symptoms that had prompted his hospital visit. He denied any other aggravating factors.\nIn the ED, the patient's vital signs were found to be remarkable for a temperature of 97.1 \u00b0F, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, heart rate of 124 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 146/27 mmHg. The patient denied any history of diabetes, kidney disease, or back pain. He had smoked half pack of cigarettes a day for \"a few years\", drank a pint of vodka three to four times a week, and used cocaine as well as marijuana daily for \"numerous\" years. He reported that he had used cocaine and marijuana a \"few\" days prior to the presentation. The patient's physical examination was significant for a decreased dull and sharp sensation of bilateral feet with intact sensation above the ankle as well as 1/5 muscle strength of bilateral legs and feet. The muscle strength was 4/5 in bilateral thighs as well as upper extremities.\nAn alcohol level screening was done in the ED, which revealed a level of less than 10 mg/dl. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, cannabinoids, and opiates. Lactic acid was elevated at 4.2. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity greater than 1.030 with large bilirubin, proteinuria, and hematuria. Urine microscopy revealed red blood cells of 4-6 high power field (HPF).\nInitial complete blood count revealed a WBC of 20.9 K/UL with 83.2% absolute neutrophils, and hemoglobin and hematocrit level of 21.7 gm/dl and 64.1%, respectively, with a platelet count of 344 K. The patient\u2019s complete metabolic panel was significant for elevated liver enzymes - aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 3,334 U/L (normal range: 15-41 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 850 U/L (normal range: 17-63 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 151 U/L (normal range: 38-126 U/L); there was renal insufficiency with a creatinine level of 4.16 mg/dl (normal range: 0.7-1.2 mg/dl), urine nitrogen of 32 mg/dl (normal range: 8-20 mg/dl), and potassium of 7.4 mmol/l (normal range: 3.6-5.1 mmol/L) with high anion gap of 21. An arterial blood gas revealed PH of 7.23, PCO2 of 32 mmHg, HCO3 of 14.9 mmol/L, signifying metabolic acidosis with adequate respiratory compensation. CPK levels were markedly elevated at 100,809 U/L. Initial ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with peaked T wave as seen in Figure .\nThe patient received 2 grams of calcium gluconate infusion for cardiac membrane stabilization. He also received insulin and Kayexalate, which corrected his hyperkalemia. The patient was started on IV fluid (IVF) hydration with strict urine output monitoring. Initial MRI without contrast of spine was performed and was only remarkable for mild spondylosis without spondylolisthesis in the L4-L5 region. Neurology was consulted for a more thorough neurological examination, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.\nIn the ICU, the patient\u2019s symptoms started to worsen and he reported progression of the numbness up to the knee in both lower limbs. He also complained of worsening pain and weakness in the right lower extremity. During the ICU stay, the right thigh became more swollen compared to the left. Urgent CT scan of the right lower extremity revealed right leg edema without focal tissue or osseous abnormality, as seen in Video .\nDoppler ultrasound showed normal arterial flow and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient started experiencing new-onset right lower extremity weakness. Dorsal pedis and tibial pedis pulses were present bilaterally. At this juncture, there were concerns for acute compartment syndrome. The patient was placed on neurovascular checks every hour. Intracompartmental pressures were measured frequently, which remained low. Also, surgery was consulted for possible fasciotomy.\nDespite aggressive IVF hydration, the patient\u2019s CPK levels continued to rise. CPK levels peaked at 237,025U/L, even though his hemoconcentration had resolved. Creatinine levels continued to increase, and the patient became anuric and IVF hydration was discontinued. Vascular surgery and nephrology were consulted for emergent Uldall catheter placement and urgent hemodialysis, respectively.\nFollowing repeat sessions of hemodialysis, the patient's renal function improved and CPK levels declined. His lower extremity weakness also started to improve. There was a significant improvement in his left lower extremity numbness. The right leg swelling resolved; however, there was only a mild improvement of motor and sensory loss. The patient continued to undergo physical therapy during his hospitalization. He was subsequently discharged to subacute rehabilitation. The patient was advised to continue with outpatient hemodialysis till full recovery of his renal function was achieved. He was also recommended to follow up with neurology as an outpatient. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "Ultrasonographic examination of an asymptomatic 62-year-old woman with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection revealed a hypoechogenic lesion in liver segment III. Active chronic liver disease was diagnosed 12 years previously based on liver biopsy that revealed a grade of 8 and stage 3 according to the Ishak staging system. Results of laboratory investigations were as follows: HCV RNA, 2530000 IU/ml; normal lactate dehydrogenase level (270 U/l [normal, 240\u2013450 U/l]); haemoglobin, 12.9 g/dl; platelet count, 175.000/mm3; white blood cell count, 4900/mm2; aspartate aminotransferase, 40 U/l; alanine aminotransferase, 65 U/l; albumin, 4.1 g/dl and total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dl. Total body computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast revealed several nodular liver lesions with early arterial phase enhancement and slow washout with uncertain diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated hyperintensity on post-contrast T1-weighted images of the lesions and isointensity in the T2 phase (). Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose demonstrated only intense fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in different areas of the liver as a unique localization of the neoplasm. A liver biopsy was prompted by the uncertain behavior of the liver lesions. Microscopic examination of the liver biopsy revealed infiltration of typical centrocyte-like lymphoid cells and lymphoepithelial lesions in these small- to medium-size lymphocytes (). Immunohistochemistry findings were positive for CD20, CD79a and BCL-2, and negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD43 and cyclin D1 (). A diagnosis of stage IV liver MZL was made. Bone marrow biopsy did not reveal infiltration of lymphocytes. After haematology consultation, it was decided to administer antiviral therapy with sofosbuvir (NS5B inhibitor) associated with simeprevir (a protease inhibitor) for a duration of 12 weeks. Three months after the conclusion of antiviral treatment, HCV RNA was negative, thus confirming the eradication of HCV infection. MRI performed 6 and 12 months after antiviral therapy demonstrated complete resolution of the liver lesions (). Currently, no liver lesions are apparent on MRI after 3 years of follow-up.

    "question": "A 42-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment after intentionally ingesting fertilizer containing 100% sodium silicate. He had ingested about 50 mL of fertilizer 2 days prior to admission. On presentation, he complained of a sore throat and epigastric pain. The patient had a medical history of unmedicated chronic hepatitis B and had worked in a car-manufacturing factory for 10 years. He had a 20 pack-year smoking history. On admission, his blood pressure was 130/78 mmHg, pulse rate was 98 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and body temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. He had mild painful oral erosion and his lungs sounded clear to auscultation. Laboratory results from another hospital immediately after the ingestion had revealed the following findings: serum creatinine (Cr), 1.1 mg/dL; white blood cell (WBC) count, 113,600 cells/\u03bcL; the arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) results were as follows: pH, 7.340; PCO2, 40.3 mmHg; PO2, 96.8 mmHg; HCO3, 21.2 mm/L; and O2 saturation, 96.8% on room air. On admission to our hospital, laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin, 16.3 g/dL; WBC count, 23,290 cells/\u03bcL; platelet count, 167,000 cells/\u03bcL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 48 mg/dL; serum Cr, 5.06 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 1.7 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 68 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 43 U/L; and glucose, 140 mg/dL. ABGA results were as follows: pH, 7.415; PCO2, 36.6 mmHg; PO2, 73 mmHg; HCO3, 25.5 mm/L; and O2 saturation, 95% on room air. Urinary analysis revealed a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1.010, 2+ protein, 2+ glucose, trace occult blood, and no WBCs, with proteinuria at 550 mg/day. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers were below 1 : 40 (nuclear pattern) and results for other serologic markers were nonspecific. Abdominal sonography revealed increased kidney size with increased parenchymal echogenicity.\nDespite continuous fluid therapy, the patient's levels of BUN and Cr increased gradually, and thus renal biopsy was performed on day 3 of admission. The kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis without infiltration of inflammatory cells. Although the histologic findings were not diffuse, definite features of tubular damage were noted. Necrotic sloughing of tubular cells was found, with mitotic figures present in regenerating tubular cells. Necrotic cellular casts were also noted in the tubular lumina (). Ultrastructural examination revealed electron-dense deposits in subendothelium of glomerular capillaries. And focal effacement and fusion of foot processes of podocytes were noted (). Tubular cells contained electron-dense lysosomes in the cytoplasm and lumina ().\nThe development of acute respiratory distress syndrome was observed on day 4: arterial PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg. Corticosteroid therapy for acute lung injury was administered for 28 days, beginning on day 5 (1 mg/kg/day of intravenous methylprednisolone for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week taper). Hemodialysis was provided 5 times from day 5 to day 10 for the treatment of hyperkalemia and oliguria. After the termination of hemodialysis, the patient's renal function recovered completely. During the administration of corticosteroid therapy, pulmonary fibrosis was observed on chest computed tomography. On day 16, bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema occurred. Although bilateral closed tube thoracotomy and a lung protective ventilation strategy were applied, the pneumothorax and pulmonary fibrosis progressed gradually. The patient died of complicated lung fibrosis and persistent pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum on day 40 of hospitalization. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "An 81-year-old male presented to the clinic with yellowish discoloration of skin and urine for 2 weeks. He denied any fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, or acholic stools. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease stage IV. He reported recent loss of appetite but denied any significant weight changes. Ultrasound ordered by primary care physician showed intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilation with distension of gall bladder without cholelithiasis. He was sent to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation.\nOn examination, blood pressure was 133/60 mmHg, heart rate was 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 23 breaths per minute, temperature was 97.7\u00b0F, and oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. He had mild icteric sclera, and chronic venous stasis changes in bilateral lower extremities were noted. Bowel sounds were normal, and no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal tenderness was noted on exam.\nLaboratory investigations showed a hemoglobin count of 11 g/dl, white blood cell count of (WBC) 3800 cell/mm3, and platelet count of 214,000/mm3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were elevated at 326 and 321 IU/L, respectively. Total bilirubin was 3.1 mg/dl with direct bilirubin of 1.8 mg/dl. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 1,219 IU/L with lipase 250 IU/L. Renal function tests were at baseline at 1.72 mg/dl (baseline 1.7\u20131.9 mg/dl). Recent upper and lower endoscopy (1 month earlier) did not show significant abnormalities, except for mild antral gastropathy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed stable pelvic adenopathy with largest lymph node measuring 4.4 \u00d7 1.7 cm (which was noted on the earlier CT scan as well). The pancreatic tissue and abdominal vessels appeared normal. With concern for underlying malignancy, a lymph node biopsy was performed. Endoscopic retrograde of cholangiopancreatography revealed distal common bile duct stricture of 3 cm without obstruction, for which a biliary stent was placed. No pancreatic lesions were observed, and biliary brushings were negative for malignancy.\nThe patient returned to the ED two months later; this time with a fever (102\u00b0F), nausea, and right upper quadrant pain for 2 days. Complete blood counts revealed elevated white cell count of 18,700/mm3. AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels were within normal limits, and ALP was elevated at 127 IU/L. The CT scan of abdomen revealed intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and gall bladder wall thickening with pericholecystic inflammatory stranding with normal pancreas (). He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with piperacillin-tazobactam. Urgent surgical decompression with percutaneous drain placement was performed for stent blockage (with re-stent placement) and bile duct stricture from unknown etiology.\nMeanwhile, histopathology from the earlier right iliac lymph node biopsy revealed sinus histiocytic aggregates interlaced with lymphocytes and plasma cells (), majority of cellular constituents being plasma cells, characterized by oval cellular contours and eccentrically located nuclei (); this was confirmed by diffuse immunoreactivity for CD138 (). Chromogenic in situ hybridization for kappa light chain () and lambda light chain () showed a mixture of kappa and lambda-bearing cells (approximate kappa to lambda ratio of 3 : 1); this finding suggested that the plasma cells were reactive in nature, arguing against the possibility of a plasma cell neoplasm. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) was interpreted as negative.\nAs there was no evidence to suggest a lymphoma or a plasma cell neoplasm, a diagnosis of IgG-related disease was considered. Additional immunohistochemistry showed that the plasma cells present expressed predominantly IgG (); of these, the majority (over 60%) were reactive for IgG4 (). Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation showed polyclonal increase in IgG with no monoclonal proteins. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels were high (3390 mg/dl) with normal IgA and IgM. IgG subclasses were also high with IgG1 of 1800, IgG2 975, IgG3 324, and IgG4 729 mg/dl.\nA diagnosis of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis was made, and he was started on prednisone 40 mg daily for 6 weeks. A follow-up CT scan of abdomen after a month revealed significant reduction in the size of his pelvic lymph nodes with largest lymph node measuring 1.8 \u00d7 0.7 cm (). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) performed revealed resolution of stricture (). The biliary stent was removed following resolution of the stricture. He remains on prednisone 20 mg daily with close rheumatology follow-up. Rituximab therapy is being considered as a steroid-sparing agent. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 64-year-old male patient was admitted to the Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Dankook University Hospital (Cheonan, Korea) for treatment of progressive dyspnea and cough. The patient had undergone right lobectomy of the liver due to HCC at Severance Hospital (Seoul, Korea) on October 23, 2006. At that time, the surgical specimen was confirmed to be HCC, Edmondson grade II. After 14 months, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lung metastases and left adrenal gland metastasis. The level of serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA II) was elevated abnormally (207 mAU/ml). Diagnosed with recurrent HCC with multiple lung metastases and adrenal metastasis, the patient received palliative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and carboplatin. Following two cycles of first-line chemotherapy, the disease progressed. The patient was administered two more cycles of second-line chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and carboplatin, and three cycles of third-line chemotherapy with oral capecitabine. However, the disease demonstrated no objective response and further progressed. The patient and physician agreed to discontinue cytotoxic chemotherapy, and the patient was transferred to Dankook University Hospital for paliative care on February 19, 2009.\nThe patient was a chronic hepatitis B virus carrier and an older brother had hepatitis B viral liver cirrhosis. Initial laboratory data from our hospital was as follows: White blood cell count, 4,970 cells/\u03bcl; hemoglobin level, 17.2 g/dl; platelet count, 16.4\u00d7104 platelets/\u03bcl; aspartate aminotransferase : alanine aminotransferase level, 32:41 IU/l; total bilirubin level, 0.97 mg/dl; gamma guanosine triphosphate level, 17 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase level, 89 IU/l; protein : albumin level, 8.4:4.3 g/dl; prothrombin time (international normalized ratio), 13.2 sec (1.14); \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) level, 16.55 ng/ml (normal range, 0\u201315 ng/ml); and PIVKA II level, 12,900 mAU/ml (normal range, 0\u201340 mAU/ml). Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase chain reaction test results were positive. At the time of admission, a chest radiograph of the patient revealed miliary nodules in the entirety of the lungs. CT scan of the chest and abdominopelvis indicated miliary metastases throughout the lungs, bilateral adrenal metastases and metastatic abdominal lymph nodes (). The patient was observed at regular three-monthly follow-ups. After the first three months, the patient continued to exhibit cough and dyspnea, and there was no definitive interval change of the multiple lung metastases on the chest radiograph. At the second visit on September 14, 2009, the general condition of the patient had improved, and the cough and dyspnea had stopped. A chest radiograph revealed that all metastatic nodules had disappeared (). Serum AFP level had decreased to 1.5 ng/ml. Spontaneous tumor regression of HCC was observed, and whole-body positron emission tomography-CT scan in December, 2009 revealed that all metastatic nodules in the lung, as well as the metastatic lesions of the two adrenal glands and lymph nodes, had disappeared. The patient had taken an alternative herbal medicine for approximately one week, on the recommendation of his family. The herbal medicine was Dendropanax morbifera Leveille, which is a subtropical, broad-leaved evergreen tree belonging to the family Araliaceae ().\nFollow-up CT scans revealed no recurrent lesions, and follow-up chest radiograph also indicated no metastatic lesions. Serum AFP and PIVKA II levels were within the normal range (). The patient is alive without any symptoms or signs as of May 2013. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 65-year-old female with history of chronic alcohol use was hospitalized for sudden onset of hematemesis. She also reported few days of nausea and vomiting associated with worsening ascites. She denied any significant past medical history except for a ruptured ovarian cyst at age of 30 years that required emergent surgery. Patient had a long history of alcohol use (two glasses of vodka daily) for over 10 years. Physical exam showed scleral icterus, there was mild abdominal distention with epigastric tenderness, no hepatosplenomegaly was noted. No signs of encephalopathy or asterixis were seen. Blood test showed hemoglobin 10.4 \u00d7 10 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7.7 \u00d7 103 cells/\u00b5L and platelet count of 190 \u00d7 103 cells/\u00b5L. Her prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR) were elevated at 1.4 and 14.3 s, respectively. Liver function test showed aspartate transaminase 140 U/L, alanine transaminase 29 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 332 U/L, total bilirubin 9.6 mg/dL (direct 7.4 mg/dL, indirect 2.2 mg/dL). Few hours after admission, she developed an episode of hematemesis with drop in hemoglobin to 7.7 g/dL. Emergent endoscopy showed a non-bleeding 2 cm prepyloric gastric antral ulcer (). Biopsy of the ulcer base was negative for malignancy or H. pylori.\nFollow-up endoscopy at an interval of 6 weeks showed a healing prepyloric antral ulcer with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy (). Patient had a repeat endoscopy at 4 months for persistent nausea and vomiting which again showed a healing antral ulcer. She continued to drink alcohol and was intermittently followed by her the primary care physician. She also reported daily NSAID use for abdominal pain and nausea. She had multiple emergency department (ED) visits for the same complaints and underwent repeat endoscopy which showed a duodenal ulcer (). She was managed with pantoprazole twice daily and was advised to avoid NSAIDs and alcohol. She also underwent extensive workup for recurrent nausea and vomiting which were all unremarkable. Systemic disorders including but not limited to neurological cause, adrenal, parathyroid and diabetes were also ruled out.\nShe again presented to the ED for worsening nausea and vomiting associated with upper abdominal pain. Endoscopy, now 7 years from the discovery of the initial lesion, showed a GDF. The prepyloric antral ulcer had fistulized into the duodenal bulb creating the appearance of a double pylorus (). Biopsy of the ulcer base was again negative for malignancy or H. pylori. H. pylori stool antigen and serum H. pylori antibody test were also negative. She was discharged on oral proton pump inhibitor and has been followed up with gastroenterology for management of Laennec\u2019s cirrhosis. With more frequent outpatient follow up, alcohol abstinence and use of acid-suppression medication, she had gradual improvement in her symptoms in about 1 - 2 months.

    "question": "A 61-year-old male was admitted to general hospital in Tangerang, due to progression of fatigue since a week before. The patient had history of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and hemolytic anemia since 12 and 7 years ago consecutively. The ET was diagnosed based on bone marrow biopsy done that showed proliferation of megakaryocytes, not meeting other myelodysplastic syndrome. He was treated with hydroxyurea for 5 years and then substituted with azathioprine due to possible of hydroxyurea-induced hemolytic anemia. The patient was diagnosed of hemolytic anemia as the immunoglobulin G (IgG) on Coombs test was positive. Approximately 3 years ago, the patient experienced abdominal enlargement with tenderness on the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. Noncontrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan examination was done and the results showed hepatic cirrhosis, splenomegaly, portal hypertension and ascites. He had history of packed red cell transfusion due to anemia 7 years ago. A year before admission, he experienced mutiple episodes of hematemesis and melena that caused anemia and series of packed red cell transfusion. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which showed rupture of esophageal varives, which was then ligated ( and 2).\nAt admission, the patient was compos mentis with vital signs blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 96 beats perminute, respiratory rate of 17 times perminute, and temperature 36\u00b0C. His body weight was 58 kg, height 173 cm, BMI of 19.3. His skin was icteric, with icteric sclera and pale conjunctiva.

    "question": "A 60-year-old Japanese man was admitted to Honjo Daiichi Hospital due to proteinuria and edema. He had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. On admission, his blood pressure was 136/83 mmHg. A physical examination showed bilateral pretibial edema. No abnormal signs were observed in the lungs, heart, or abdomen.\nUrinalysis showed heavy proteinuria (5.1 g/g creatinine) without hematuria. His leukocyte count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were 5,900/\u00b5L, 14.7 g/dL, and 191,000/\u00b5L, respectively. Serum total protein was 5.2 g/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 8.4 mg/dL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 16 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 11 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 206 U/L, total cholesterol 261 mg/dL, IgG 572 mg/dL, IgA 345 mg/dL, IgM 93 mg/dL, C3 80 mg/dL (normal range: 65 \u2013 135 mg/dL), and C4 12 mg/dL (normal range: 13 \u2013 35 mg/dL). Tests for anti-nuclear antibodies, cryoglobulin, hepatitis B virus antigen, and anti-hepatitis C antibodies were all negative. Monoclonal proteins were not detected in the serum or urine. Circulating IgA-class anti-PLA2R antibodies were not determined by our in-house ELISA [] using peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgA as a secondary antibody.\nDue to the presence of NS, a renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed global scleroses in 2 of 20 glomeruli. The functioning glomeruli showed no mesangial proliferation and no bubbling/spike appearance along the glomerular capillary walls (). In the tubulointerstitium, mild lymphocyte infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were observed. There was moderate arteriolar hyalinosis. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed 2+ granular staining for IgA- and IgA1-heavy chains (b, c), 2+ granular staining for \u03ba- and \u03bb-light chains (f, g), and trace granular staining for C3 (h) along the glomerular capillary walls, but no significant staining for IgG-, IgA2-, IgM-heavy chains, or C1q (a, d, e, i). An immunofluorescence study using anti-PLA2R antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) showed negative glomerular staining. Electron microscopy revealed extensive foot process effacement of the podocytes, which contained large amounts of dense materials mainly in the area covering the surface of the glomerular basement membrane, but not in the mesangial area (a). Small amounts of electron-dense deposits were observed beneath the cytoplasm of the podocytes containing the dense materials (b). From the above-mentioned pathological findings, the diagnosis of early stage MN with solitary polyclonal IgA deposition was made.\nHe was treated with low-dose prednisolone (PSL) (10 mg/day for 8 weeks) in consideration of his history of type 2 diabetes. Thereafter, partial effects on proteinuria were observed, and PSL doses were gradually tapered. At the 3-year follow-up he was well. His urinary protein was 2.1 g/g creatinine, serum total protein 5.8 g/dL, albumin 3.5 g/dL, and creatinine 0.87 mg/dL. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 69-year-old man presented with general malaise, anorexia, and a history of daily alcohol consumption;he was admitted to Hanawa Kousei Hospital. There was no pertinent history pertaining to medical treatment, family, medication, blood transfusion, or allergy. He had been drinking approximately 900 mL of sake daily for the past 49 years, and had a 29 pack-year smoking history. He had bowel movements once or twice daily with no history of habitual laxative use or enemas. On physical examination, he was lucid, had a heart rate of 84/min, blood pressure of 138/66 mm Hg, and a temperature of 36.9\u00b0C;there was jaundice and hepatomegaly. Laboratory findings included white blood cells 9,100/\u03bcL, red blood cells 366\u00d710\n4/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL, platelets 15.1\u00d710\n4/\u03bcL, total protein 5.4 g/dL, albumin 2.3 g/dL, total bilirubin 5.85 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 4.02 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 185 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 182 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 526 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 1,312 U/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase 1.782 U/L, amylase 42 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 29.4 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.54 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 6.31 mg/dL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 9.7 ng/mL, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) 54 U/mL, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor 510 U/mL. Hepatitis virus markers and autoantibodies were negative. Urine was positive for ketone bodies. A non-contrast CT confirmed hepatomegaly, with no evidence of bile duct obstruction or malignant tumor (). In addition, CT showed localized colonic wall-thickening at the splenic flexure (). We diagnosed the patient as having acute alcoholic hepatitis in light of his drinking history. He had avoided medical checkups previously; on the other hand, he had no other conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or hyperuricemia, after admission. His clinical symptoms, jaundice, and liver dysfunction rapidly improved with fluid replacement and rest. Non-contrast CT on admission showed colonic wall-thickening at the splenic flexure, and a blood test showed a slight increase in CEA. Since the patient had not previously undergone CS, it was performed to rule out colon cancer on the seventh hospital day. The colonic splenic flexure showed redness over two-thirds of its circumference and an ulcerative, slightly constricted lesion approximately 5 cm in length (). Differential diagnosis included IC, colon cancer, malignant lymphoma, infectious enteritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, but the histopathological findings on biopsy showed only nonspecific inflammatory changes. On the 12th hospital day, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed a thickened colonic splenic flexure wall. There was no enhancement of the intestinal wall (). Although calcification of the aorta was observed, there was no evidence of calcification or occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery, inferior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein, inferior mesenteric vein, branches, or portal vein. The patient had constipation after initiation of conservative treatment, and malignancy could not be ruled out from the findings of contrast-enhanced CT. On day 30 after starting treatment, a second CS revealed complete circumferential stenosis of the colonic splenic flexure with difficulty in passing the scope through the proximal side (). With gastrografin contrast radiography through CS, full-circumference stenosis to approximately 3 cm was recognized (). Stricture-type IC was suspected based on the first endoscopy and rapid course of circumferential stenosis. Histopathological findings on biopsy showed erosion of the mucosa, edema of the stroma, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, confirming the diagnosis of IC (). Surgery was also considered, but the patient had only mild symptoms of constipation, which were judged not to be indicative of complete intestinal obstruction. Therefore, conservative treatment with oral laxatives and intestinal motion regulators was performed. CEA decreased to 6.0 ng/mL on the 56th hospital day. CS showed scarring and healing of the lesion on the 105th hospital day (), and histopathological findings on biopsy showed no evidence of malignancy. What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?",

    "question": "A 38-year-old Taiwanese man having a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, without regular medical follow-up, was admitted to the hospital. Right flank pain had occurred 10 days before this admission, and treatment was then prescribed for a muscle strain at a rural hospital. The pain, which radiated to the right upper abdomen, was accompanied with a fever, which developed for 3 days. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further analysis and management. Upon arrival to our hospital, his vital signs included a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, a heart rate of 122 beats/min, blood pressure of 120/72 mm Hg, and a body temperature of 39.5\u00b0C. A physical examination revealed mild pale conjunctiva, rapid regular heart beats, tenderness, and rebounding pain over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and also a knocking tenderness over the right flank region. Laboratory tests uncovered a white blood cell count (WBC) of 31,700/mm3, with segmented neutrophils at 96.6%, hemoglobin at 10.8 g/dL, platelet counts of 407 \u00d7 103/mm3, blood urea nitrogen at 50 mg/dL, creatinine at 2.7 mg/dL, lactate at 16.3 mg/dL, albumin at 2.3 g/dL, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase at 122 U/L, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase at 49 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase at 486 U/L, alkaline phosphatase at 432 U/L, C-reactive protein at 40.4 mg/dL, blood glucose at 106 mg/dL, along with other test result levels which were unremarkable. A CT scan demonstrated fluid accumulation at the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal spaces, multiple cystic lesions within the right kidney, along with an irregular surface of the kidney adjacent to retroperitoneal fluid (Fig. ). Purulent fluid was aspirated from the right subphrenic space for analysis, with the results indicating there was a WBC of 78,750/mm3, with an 85% level of segmented neutrophils. Percutaneous catheters were implanted for drainage of the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal abscesses using ceftriaxone at 2000 mg once daily. Six days later, an uncontrolled sepsis persisted due to the patient's failure to respond to medical treatment. Subsequently, a nephrectomy for the renal abscess was carried out involving debridement of the retroperitoneal abscess. Anaerobic cultures of the right subphrenic and retroperitoneal abscess grew both A israelii and Bacteroides fragilis. Aerobic cultures of the ascites and abscess uncovered no traces of bacteria. An anaerobic culture of the nephrectomy specimen yielded A israelii. Anaerobic, aerobic bacterial, and fungal cultures of the patient's blood and urine proved to be negative. Acid fast stain and cultures for tuberculosis were not found in either the urine or nephrectomy specimen. The pathologic results revealed multiple renal abscesses involving actinomycosis with the characteristics of sulfur granules (Fig. ). A full course of antibiotics with intravenous penicillin G (3 million units every 4 hours) was prescribed for 2 weeks, followed by oral penicillin V given at a dose of 2 grams per day for 6 months at our out-patient facility.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and all accompanying images.

    "question": "A 67-year-old man was referred for biopsy of a known retroperitoneal mass in April 2006 after suddenly developing gross hematuria two months earlier. The patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis at a hospital three years previous on the basis of profound hypothyroidism, markedly increased levels of autoimmune antibody (thyroglobulin antibody 1,587.2 U/mL, normal values: 0 - 60 U/mL; microsomal antibody > 3,000 U/mL, normal values: 0 - 60 U/mL), and a diffuse hypoechogenic ultrasonographic pattern. Upon referral in April of 2006, he had been taking levothyroxine to control his Hashimoto's. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis at a previous hospital revealed a retroperitoneal soft tissue mass extending from the lower pole of the kidney to the iliac chains, inducing bilateral ureteral obstruction. The CT did not demonstrate soft tissue between the aorta and vertebra or lymphadenopathy, excluding malignancy. A right percutaneous nephrostomy was also performed at the previous hospital in order to decompress hydronephrosis due to the retroperitoneal mass.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 140/100 mmHg and body temperature was 36.5\u2103. The lungs were clear to auscultation, heart sounds were within normal limits, and the abdomen was soft with no masses or tenderness. There was no lower extremity edema observed and the thyroid gland was not enlarged. Results of the complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, urea nitrogen, protein, albumin, bilirubin, \u03b22-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were within normal ranges. Upon immunological testing, immunoglobulin G, C3 and C4 levels remained within normal ranges. No cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody or cryoglobulin was detected, and antinuclear antibodies and anti-DNA antibodies were negative. The patient showed signs of hypothyroidism with an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (69.56 \u00b5IU/mL, normal values: 0.4 - 3.1 \u00b5IU/mL) and reduced free T4 (0.83 ng/dL, normal values: 0.73 - 1.95 ng/dL). Upon autoantibody screening, the thyroglobulin (1,368.7 U/mL, normal values: 0 - 60 U/mL) and microsomal antibodies were elevated (> 3,000 U/mL, normal values: 0 - 60 U/mL) despite good medication compliance. After initiating an increased dose of levothyroxine (0.2 mg), laparoscopic biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass was performed.\nMicroscopically, the mass was ill-defined and composed predominantly of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The inflammatory cells were mainly lymphocytes and plasma cells with the occasional formation of lymphoid follicles (). Based on pathologic diagnosis, the patient was started on deflazacort 72 mg daily. The patient was discharged after 13 days of hospitalization and continued to receive steroid therapy at the outpatient clinic. Normal thyroid function was achieved after two months of steroid treatment; therefore levothyroxine therapy was withdrawn. Steroids were tapered to 6 mg after two months, which is the patient's current dose. The patient experienced no side effects during steroid treatment. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated marked reduction of the retroperitoneal mass and no sign of hydronephrotic change in either kidney. Moreover, an abdominal-pelvic CT scan performed nine months after steroid treatment showed reduced mass lesion in the retroperitoneal space with resolved right side hydronephrosis ().

He was diagnosed of having schizophrenia 4 years ago and was attending a psychiatric clinic. He was started on clozapine, 4 weeks ago (200 mg daily), because of inadequate control of symptoms with conventional antipsychotics. On examination he was febrile (102 \u00b0F), not pale or icteric. He did not have lymphadenopathy. Blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and pulse rate was 110 bpm with good volume. His respiratory rate was 32 cycles per minute. Examination of the abdomen, cardiovascular and respiratory systems were unremarkable.\nHis full blood count (FBC), which was done a day prior to hospital admission showed white blood cell count (WBC) 2.9 \u00d7 103/\u00b5l, absolute neutrophil count 667/\u00b5l (23 %), lymphocytes 2117/\u00b5l (73 %), Hemoglobin (Hb) 11.3 g/dl, platelet 188 \u00d7 103/\u00b5l. The first FBC during the hospital stay showed reduced blood counts, of which WBC 0.2 \u00d7 103/\u00b5l with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 110/\u00b5l, lymphocyte count 80/\u00b5l, Hb 12.2 g/dl and platelet 972 \u00d7 103/\u00b5l. The C reactive protein was (CRP) 270 mg/L (<6 mg/L). His chest X ray, ultrasound scan (USS) of abdomen and pelvis, urine full report was normal. Serology for dengue virus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvo B19 virus were negative. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia.\nClinical diagnosis of neutropenic sepsis was made. He was treated with intravenous imipenum, vancomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole and fluconazole. His serial blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum cultures were negative. His FBC was monitored twice daily throughout hospital stay, showed severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia which later complicated by anemia from the 3rd day of hospital stay (Table ; Fig. ). The reticulocyte count was 1.1 % (normal 0.5\u20132.5). The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) on the 3rd day and treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) 300 \u00b5g daily for 10 days. On the 5th day he developed swelling of his left inguinal region with mild skin induration. The initial USS of left groin showed only subcutaneous tissue oedema. This subsequently progressed to an abscess which was drained. His white cell count and platelet count improved with 10 days of treatment with G-CSF. Hemoglobin normalized in 4 weeks of treatment. At this stage his WBC count was 12 \u00d7 103/\u00b5l with absolute neutrophil count 7200/\u00b5l (60 %), hemoglobin 12.6 g/dl and platelets 212 \u00d7 103/\u00b5l.

    "question": "A 65-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath which was progressively worsening two days prior to presentation. She also reported having a fever with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius ( \u0366C), chills, and nonproductive cough in the last two days. The patient denied exposure to sick contacts, recent travel outside the state, or recent immobilization. Her temperature on admission was 39 \u0366C, blood pressure 132/80 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 per minute. Physical examination was significant for lethargy, bilateral rales on auscultation of lung fields. Her oxygen saturation was 88% while on 5 liters per minute delivered through nasal cannula so she was placed on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with viral pneumonia. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory results at the time of admission are presented in Table .\nShe was started on remdesevir and dexamethasone as per institutional guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 viral pneumonia. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 120 per minute, so anticoagulation was started with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 1mg/kg dosing twice daily and rate-controlling medications were administered. 12 hours after admission to the hospital, right arm motor drift, facial droop, and dysarthria were noted. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 3. Emergent CT of the head revealed age indeterminate lacunar infarct in the left basal ganglia, with no intracranial hemorrhage. CT perfusion study of head and neck showed occlusion of the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) with occlusive thrombus extending into the proximal left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) (Figure ).\nLeft ACA opacified via an anterior communicating artery. Corresponding large 126 ccs of ischemic penumbra involving the left frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, basal ganglia were also seen. Anticoagulation was switched from LMWH to unfractionated heparin (UFH) in anticipation of the revascularization procedure. The case was discussed with an Interventional neurologist and the decision was made not to proceed with revascularization due to low NIHSS. While the patient was being monitored in the stroke unit, on day 3 of admission, she developed new right-sided hemiplegia, aphasia with altered mentation. The emergent CT of the head showed an increasing size of the infarct within the left basal ganglia and corona radiata. CT perfusion showed stable left ICA/MCA occlusion, however, due to progressive symptoms she underwent emergent left ICA/MCA thrombectomy. The weakness improved after revascularization with an increase in muscle strength from 1/5 to 3/5 in both right upper and lower extremities. UFH was discontinued due to an elevated risk of bleeding post revascularization.\nOn day 7 after the procedure, anticoagulation was restarted with LMWH due to coexisting atrial fibrillation and COVID-19 infection. At this point, the patient completed a 10-day course of remdesevir and dexamethasone and was saturating well with 3 liters per minute supplemental oxygen through the nasal cannula. two days after restarting anticoagulation, a stroke code was called due to sudden onset, left lower extremity weakness. CT perfusion of head and neck demonstrated new distal left M2 branch occlusion within the Sylvian fissure. Mural thrombi were noted in the distal aortic arch and descending aorta. A complete angiogram of the chest and abdomen was done to determine the extent of clot burden. CT angiogram of the chest confirmed the presence of mural thrombus (Figure ).\nAlong with that, a large filling defect was noted within the right interlobar pulmonary artery with extension into the right middle and lower lobe pulmonary artery as well as segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe compatible with pulmonary embolism (Figure ). CT angiogram of the abdomen showed thrombus in left common femoral artery extending into proximal internal iliac as well as left external iliac arteries (Figures , ). There is a reconstitution of flow within both arteries distally. Platelets dropped from 174 to 63 within few days after restarting anticoagulation (Figure ). 4T score for screening of HIT was 6 (2 each for greater than 50% drop and nadir >30, timing within 5-10 days of exposure and new thrombosis). LMWH was switched to argatroban infusion. Platelet factor 4 antibody test and serotonin release assay test (SRA) were positive (Table ).\nThe patient underwent a left lower extremity angiogram by vascular surgery and treated with tissue plasminogen activator catheter-directed thrombolysis (tPA-CDT). Revascularization was successful with three-vessel runoff and dopplerable pulses in the left lower extremity. Anticoagulation was subsequently switched to apixaban. The patient recovered from COVID-19 and was discharged to the nursing home for rehabilitation for stroke. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "In March 2015, a 45-year-old Korean woman presented to our emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath and an episode of seizure. Five hours before arriving in the ED, she developed a tonic-clonic seizure for 30 seconds and a high temperature of 40\u2103. The patient had preceding upper respiratory infection 4 days before coming to the ED. She also complained of severe coughing productive of blood-tinged sputum, and generalized myalgias. Her past medical history was unremarkable except for recurrent (one or two per year) epileptic seizures with oral phenytoin maintenance for 25 years. She had no known allergies. She did not receive the seasonal influenza vaccine.\nOn physical examination, the patient's blood pressure was 91/59 mmHg, and she had tachycardia (114/min), tachypnea (32/min), and a temperature of 37.9\u2103. She looked acutely ill, but was mentally alert. Examination of her lungs revealed coarse crackles throughout bilaterally. Other findings were unremarkable. A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and bilateral patchy consolidations. An electrocardiogram revealed low QRS voltage in the precordial leads (the entire QRS-complex amplitude was <8 mm). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH of 7.38, carbon dioxide tension of 27.7 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen of 59.8 mmHg, bicarbonate level of 16.7 mmol/L, base excess of 6.4 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation level of 90.7%. The patient was given supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (2 L/min).\nInitial laboratory findings revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 18.8 \u00d7 103/mm3 (neutrophils, 85.6%), platelet count of 504 \u00d7 103/mm3, blood urea nitrogen level of 14.9 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein level of 4.92 mg/L (normal range, 0.0-5.0 mg/L). An influenza rapid antigen test on the patient's nasopharyngeal swab sample, which was promptly performed because of residual seasonal influenza activity in the community, was positive for influenza A virus. She was immediately given a single dose (300 mg) of IV peramivir, and levofloxacin, 500 mg/day.\nThe patient's dyspnea worsened, however, and she became hypotensive (blood pressure, 86/53 mmHg). She was managed with increased oxygen supply (4 L/min), furosemide, and norepinephrine (0.125 \u00b5g/kg/min). Additional blood tests revealed the following component levels: troponin I, 1.36 ng/mL (normal range, 0.0-0.16 ng/mL); creatine kinase-MB (CKMB), 49.27 ng/mL (normal range, 0.0-3.61 ng/mL); creatine phosphokinase (CPK), 1,585 IU/L (normal range, 38-185 IU/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 937 IU/L (normal range, 238-422 IU/L); N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, 162.8 pg/mL (normal range, 0-125 pg/mL), and myoglobin, 138.8 ng/mL (normal range, 25-58 ng/mL). Serology for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV were all negative.\nA chest computed tomography scan demonstrated multifocal patch consolidations in both lungs, with ground-glass opacities, suggestive of pulmonary edema or atypical pneumonia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 30%, LV enlargement, diffuse hypokinesia with sparing LV apex, and decreased right ventricular apical wall motion, which was compatible with acute myocarditis ().\nThe patient was clinically diagnosed with influenza A-associated fulminant myocarditis, resulting in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock, and admitted to the intensive care unit. On day 2 of hospitalization, her hemodynamic state had stabilized and she no longer required norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure within a normal range. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram taken on day 3 showed improved ventricular systolic function, with LV ejection fraction at 55% to 60%. Laboratory tests on day 4 revealed a troponin I level of 0.168 ng/mL, CK-MB level of 41.31 ng/mL, and CPK level of 1,459 IU/L. On day 5 of her hospitalization, the patient's dyspnea had improved and supplemental oxygen was stopped. On day 6, she was transferred to a general ward. A follow-up chest computed tomography scan demonstrated improved status of pulmonary edema, with residual, mild bilateral pleural effusion. The patient was discharged with recovery on day 9 after admission. Although her muscle enzyme levels still remained elevated 16 days after discharge (CK-MB, 42.63 ng/mL; CPK, 1,340 IU/L), she had been asymptomatic and carefully observed in the outpatient clinic ().\nMonitoring of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays (Real-Q Flu A, B Detection Kit; BioSewoom Inc., Seoul, Korea) using the patient's nasopharyngeal aspirates showed positivity for both influenza A (threshold cycle value, 27.23) and subtype hH3N2 (threshold cycle value, 27.39) on day 2 (), but became negative by day 4 of the patient's hospitalization.

    "question": "A 22-month-old African-American girl was transferred from an outside hospital to the intensive care unit for further evaluation and the management of uncontrolled severe hypertension. She had a three-day history of fever, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting. She was born at term with a weight of 2.8 kg and had an unremarkable perinatal course. She had no known genetic syndromes. Besides a history of difficulty gaining weight with a current weight of 10.7 kg (seventh percentile) and a height of the 25th centile, she had no other known medical problems in the past. There was no history of urinary tract infections or blood in urine. She did not have headaches, seizures or fainting episodes. Immunizations were up-to-date. Prior blood pressure (BP) measurements were unknown because they were never obtained. There were no other past hospitalizations. She had not been taking any medications. Family history was unremarkable for kidney disease, hypertension, dialysis or transplantation.\nUpon physical examination, her vital signs were as follows: a temperature of 36.9 \u00b0C (98 \u00b0F), a respiratory rate of 16 per minute, a heart rate of 145 beats per minute, an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air, and an elevated BP of 200/120 mm Hg (manual, right upper extremity, proper size cuff; 95th percentile value for her age, gender and height 104/62 mm Hg). The examination showed a thin-appearing toddler who was not in obvious distress. The rest of the examination was negative except for tachycardia and a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the apex. A renal bruit was not heard upon auscultation. There was no skin rash or edema. The neurologic examination was normal.\nThe nasal swab for a respiratory viral panel test was positive for parainfluenza 3. Besides mild nasal congestion, she had no cough, difficulty breathing, or wheezing, and she remained stable in room air. She remained afebrile throughout the hospital admission. Her throat culture was negative for beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Her blood culture showed no growth. Her chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but no focal airspace disease, pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Her electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia. Her echocardiogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with severe concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, with an LV mass index of 187 gm/m2.7 and a mildly depressed LV systolic function with an ejection fraction of 50%. There was a thrombus in the apex of the LV. The serum brain natriuretic peptide and troponin I levels were 1565 pg/mL (normal: <100 pg/mL) and 242 pg/mL (normal: <15 pg/mL), respectively. For possible viral-induced cardiomyopathy, she was started on intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. For hypertension, she was started on nicardipine infusion, along with nitroprusside with a goal BP reduction of 30% over 24 hours. Milrinone was added for depressed LV systolic function. She remained on the maximum nicardipine infusion rate for several days due to persistent hypertension, with systolic BPs of 140\u2013150 mm Hg. Heparin was transitioned to enoxaparin and aspirin, with the resolution of the cardiac thrombus by day three. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of head showed no mass, acute intracranial hemorrhage, cytotoxic edema, midline shift, or signs of herniation. Her urine output was normal.\nA renal function test showed an initial serum sodium level of 131 meq/L with a nadir of 121 meq/L at day three of admission, a serum chloride level of 97 meq/L (nadir 84 meq/L at day three), a serum potassium level of 3.2 meq/L, a blood urea nitrogen level of 25 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. Her fasting blood glucose level was 90 mg/dL. Her urine sodium level was 89 mmol/L with a fractional excretion of sodium of 1.5%. Her serum albumin level was between 2.1 and 2.5 gm/dL, and her random urine protein to creatinine ratio was 4.6 (normal: <0.2). There was no microscopic hematuria. Her urine culture showed no growth. Her blood counts and serum complements were both normal. Her sickle cell screen was negative. A renal sonogram showed a small right kidney of 6 cm in length (36th centile) and a left kidney of 7.7 cm in length (96th centile), with good blood flow in both kidneys. Her serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity at the time of admission were both elevated at 106 ng/dL (normal: <16 ng/dL, supine, quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay) and >150 ng/mL/h, respectively (normal: 1.7\u201311.2 ng/mL/h, supine, quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; both ARUP laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA).\nA work-up for possible catecholamine-secreting tumors due to severe hypertension included the evaluation of urine and serum catecholamines. Her 24-hour urine normetanephrine, metanephrine, vanillylmandelic acid, and homovanillic acid levels were 1525 \u00b5g/g of creatinine (normal: 0\u20131300 \u00b5g/g of creatinine), 433 \u00b5g/g of creatinine (normal: 0\u2013530 \u00b5g/g of creatinine), 10 mg/g of creatinine (normal: <16 mg/g of creatinine), and 12 mg/g of creatinine (normal: <25 mg/g of creatinine), respectively. Her serum fractionated catecholamines showed the following: an epinephrine level of 152 pg/mL (normal: 36\u2013640 pg/mL) and a norepinephrine level of 1964 pg/mL (normal: 68\u20131810 pg/ml), respectively. Given a less than two-fold increase from normal range of serum norepinephrine, the suspicion of the presence of a neuroendocrine tumor was low.\nA diuretic nuclear renogram showed asymmetrical renal function with decreased blood flow and function in the small right kidney relative to the left. Her differential function was 70% in the left and 30% in the right. There was a normal uptake of the technetium-99 m MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) with prompt excretion from the left kidney. Her right kidney had little delayed uptake with prompt excretion ( and , ). A duplex sonogram of her RA showed focal elevation in velocity in the proximal right main RA (peak systolic velocity (PSV): 405 cm/second) with a decreased velocity in the mid and distal RAs (PSV: 117 and 110 cm/sec, respectively). The renal aortic ratio (RAR, the ratio of renal to aortic PSV) was elevated at 3.2. Additionally, distinct \u201ctardus-parvus\u201d (tardus-slow and late, parvus-small and little) waveforms were seen at the right hilar and interlobar arteries. This combination of an elevated PSV at the proximal right main RA along with an elevated RAR (usual cut-off 3) and abnormal waveforms was highly suggestive of proximal right main RAS. Velocities in the left main RA were normal with no differences at various segments of the main artery. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the RAs showed a small right kidney of 6 cm in length with a decreased enhancement of the superior pole of the right kidney. The origin of the right main RA was diminutive compared to the left. There was a homogenous enhancement of the left kidney with a normal appearing left RA. Hypertension at that time was well controlled with amlodipine, clonidine, furosemide, spironolactone and labetalol. Nicardipine infusion was discontinued at day seven of admission.\nA few days later, she underwent a digital subtraction angiogram (DSA), which showed a beaded appearance of the right proximal main RA, which caused a focal stenosis with post-stenotic dilatation ( and ). The pressure gradient across the stenotic lesion was 40 mm Hg. There was normal renal parenchymal perfusion. The left RA demonstrated a normal appearance of the main and branch arteries with normal renal parenchymal perfusion and no evidence of stenosis and irregularity. A diagnosis of right RA stenosis, most likely due to focal FMD, was made. In conjunction with vascular surgery and intervention radiology, it was collectively decided not to pursue the intervention of the stenotic lesion due to the risk of complication, specifically the injury or dissection of the right RA, especially because her BPs were relatively controlled on five antihypertensive agents. Subsequent to the angiogram, enalapril was added once bilateral RA stenosis was excluded for optimal BP control. A CTA of the head and neck vessels to look for evidence of FMD in the head and neck showed a normal vasculature of the vessels. Baby aspirin was started to prevent thromboembolic events.\nThough fever, parainfluenza virus infection, and LV thrombus could have partly contributed to the elevated BPs initially, these signs and symptoms had resolved at the time of or soon after admission. Additionally, the finding of a discrete anatomic lesion in the right RA that is known to cause hypertension suggests that the right RA FMD indeed was the most probable cause of the severe, long-standing hypertension, as suggested by the severe concentric LV hypertrophy. At the time of discharge two weeks later, her BPs were relatively optimal (105\u2013110 mm Hg SBPs) on enalapril, amlodipine and labetalol. Subsequent monthly clinic follow-up visits seven months later have shown stable SBPs with no clinical symptoms of hypertension. Her renal function has remained stable with normal serum electrolytes without hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Her proteinuria has resolved. A follow-up echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function and stable but persistent LV hypertrophy with no reappearance of the thrombus that was seen in the first echocardiogram. For now, we plan to closely follow-her BPs, along with a follow-up diuretic renogram and a DSA in a few months, with a tentative plan for either continued medical treatment or surgical intervention (angioplasty with or without stent and surgical revascularization or right nephrectomy) based on the clinical course.

    "question": "A 41-year-old female presenting with complaints of fever, chills, and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection including sore throat and difficulty swallowing for three days arrived at our emergency department in December 2014. The patient did not have vomiting, diarrhea, chest distress, abdominal pain, rash, jaundice, cough, or expectoration. The patient had no history of smoking or alcohol intake, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease or other chronic diseases, tuberculosis, hepatitis, typhoid fever, or other infectious diseases. In addition, there was no history of trauma, surgery or history of medicine, or food allergies. One month previously, the patient had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and prescribed methimazole (10 mg BID) and propranolol (20 mg BID) at a local hospital. The patient discontinued the medicine after taking this treatment for ten days and three weeks prior to admission, since she thought that she may be pregnant because of a delayed menstrual cycle.\nThe patient's initial assessment in the emergency department revealed a temperature of 39.9\u00b0C, heart rate of 129 beats/min, and blood pressure of 174/76 mmHg. The patient had pharyngeal congestion, bilateral tonsil enlargement, and visible purulent secretions on bilateral tonsils. The patient had a mild hand tremor; however, there was no rash or jaundice. There were normal S1 and S2 sounds in cardiac examination. The patient's abdomen was normal, and no peripheral edema or lymphadenopathy was observed. There was bilateral grade 2 thyroid enlargement. There was no evidence of ophthalmopathy. The results of a neurologic and rheumatic examination were unremarkable.\nThe laboratory findings before antithyroid treatment were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count were normal at 5200/\u03bcL (reference range, 3500 to 10500/\u03bcL) and 2300x/\u03bcL (reference range, 1500 to 8000/\u03bcL), respectively, with free T3, 16.8 pg/mL (reference range, 1.71\u20133.71 pg/mL), free T4 3.9 ng/dL (reference range, 0.7\u20131.48 ng/dL), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.0001 \u03bcIU/mL (reference range, 0.35\u20134.94 \u03bcIU/mL) in thyroid function tests.\nThe results from peripheral-blood count tests showed an absolute neutrophil count of zero and a WBC count of 400/\u03bcL at admission. Hemoglobin concentration and platelet count were normal at 13.6 g/dL (reference range, 11.5\u201316.5 g/dL) and 165 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL (reference range, 100\u2013400 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL), respectively. C-reactive protein level was markedly elevated at 155 mg/L (reference range, 0\u20135 mg/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 18 mm/h (reference range, 0\u201310 mm/h). Thyroid function tests were as follows: free T3, 3.63 pg/mL (reference range, 1.71\u20133.71 pg/mL), free T4 2.2 ng/dL (reference range, 0.7\u20131.48 ng/dL), and TSH, 0.0001 \u03bcIU/mL (reference range, 0.35\u20134.94 \u03bcIU/mL). The pregnancy test was negative. Results from the electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiography divulged no infiltration. An abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable. A peripheral-blood smear was normal except for agranulocytosis. There were no pathological findings except for borderline anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positivity in rheumatic, viral, and bacterial serological tests (). Based on these results, the patient was diagnosed with ATD-induced agranulocytosis, acute tonsillitis, and hyperthyroidism.\nOn admission to our hospital, the patient was given intravenous antibiotics (amikacin and imipenem) to control infection and propranolol to hinder T4 transformation into T3 and to prevent excitatory effects on the heart. Methimazole was not restarted because of the neutropenia. After three days the neutrophil count increased to 600/\u03bcL, after six days the neutrophil count increased to 700/\u03bcL, and after seven days the neutrophil count increased to 2600/\u03bcL. After 10 days of treatment, a blood culture yielded no microbes, the neutrophil count was increased to 2900/\u03bcL, and the patient's symptoms were generally improved; the patient no longer had fever or throat symptoms. With clinical improvement of her symptoms and recovered neutropenia, antibiotherapy was discontinued.\nResults from the thyroid ultrasonography showed bilateral parenchymal heterogeneity, increment blood supply, and a 16 mm solitary nodule in the right thyroid lobe. On thyroid scintigraphy, there was diffusely increased radioiodine uptake in the thyroid gland and a hypoactive nodule in the right lobe. Fine needle aspiration biopsy performed at two different times on the nodule was insufficient. The option of surgical treatment was agreed upon because possible thyroid malignancy could not be ruled out due to inadequate biopsy results. In January 2015, she received a bilateral total thyroidectomy for surgical treatment after obtaining euthyroidism with combination therapy including lugol solution, corticosteroid, cholestyramine, and propranolol. The results of surgical histopathology were consistent with a benign nodular hyperplasia. The patient was followed with levothyroxine replacement treatment and the absolute neutrophil count remained within the reference range at 1600 to 3600/\u03bcL. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "Our patient is a 2-year-old male who presented with a 1-day fever (Temperature: 103.6\u00b0F), cough, congestion, and inadequate oral intake. The patient's history was obtained from the patient's mother. She denied any signs of vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, respiratory distress, ear pain, or a sore throat. Additionally, the patient showed signs of dehydration. Upon an initial examination, he was agitated but consolable. An examination of his ears revealed no external deformities; his canals were patent and without inflammation, and his tympanic membranes were intact, gray, translucent, and mobile. His nose showed no external deformities, and the nares were patent. His nasal turbinates were erythematous, but no inflammation was exhibited. His oral structures were normal for a child of his age, and the mucous membranes were moist and pink, without any lesions or exudates. His teeth did not have any dental caries. His neck was supple, and no cervical lymphadenopathy was present. The rest of his physical examination also revealed negative findings. The patient's fever and irritability warranted initial laboratory tests, including a rapid influenza test, a complete blood cell count (CBC), a C-reactive protein (CRP) test, and a blood culture. Abnormal values included leukocytosis that exhibited a left shift (26 500 cells/\u00b5L) and an elevated CRP (24.7 mg/L).\nDue to his elevated CBC and CRP, the patient was called back into the office for a re-evaluation the next day. His physical examination revealed new findings of erythematous tonsils with a midline uvula, as well as left and right posterior cervical nodes. The tenderness of the nodes was difficult to decipher because the patient was irritable throughout the examination. The hydration status of the patient had improved from the previous night. The rest of his physical examination revealed similar findings as the previous day. A urinalysis was obtained via catheterization and revealed negative results. Since his elevated WBC count raised concerns of the possibility of a bacterial infection, an intramuscular ceftriaxone injection was given. The patient was sent home with instructions to the parents to report any changes in his symptoms or any reactions to the antibiotics. Subsequent tests for CBC and CRP, which were obtained on the 4th day of the patient's symptoms, were still elevated, although the levels had improved (20 000 cells/\u00b5L and 14.6 mg/L, respectively). The patient initially responded well to the antibiotics; however, his fever returned, with a temperature of 103.8\u00b0F. He was seen again in the office on the 6th day of his symptoms. At this point, he presented with a new finding of left neck swelling. He had cervical asymmetry, and his left tonsil was deviated toward the midline, due to soft tissue swelling.

    "question": "The patient is a 35-year-old lady presented to the primary care physician with the chief complaint of cough. Her past medical history is significant for a possible tuberculosis infection 15 years ago. She was in direct contact with another patient who was positive for tuberculosis at a gathering event and later completed a six-month course of anti-tuberculosis regimen prescribed by her primary care physician. She otherwise remained to be asymptomatic and healthy. Her nonproductive cough began three weeks ago. She denied fever, chest pain, dyspnea, night sweats, and weight loss but did complain of sore throat and occasional chills. She lived at home with her family and reported to have sick contact with her kids as they were suffering from an upper respiratory infection. She decided to present to the office for further evaluation due to concerns about possible tuberculosis reactivation.\nHer initial vital signs on presentation were as follows: blood pressure 116/59 mmHg, heart rate 81 beats per minute, temperature 97.8\u00b0F, body mass index 20.97. Physical examination was completely benign. There was a low clinical suspicion of active tuberculosis given her overall clinical impression. She was recommended to follow up in the clinic in a few weeks after obtaining a two-view chest x-ray (CXR), sputum acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear, and culture. The patient was followed up via telemedicine over the next few weeks. She continued to have a mild cough with a low clinical suspicion for tuberculosis. The AFB smear and culture could not have been completed due to a lack of sputum samples. CXR revealed small rim calcified lesions in the right mid and upper lung zones suggestive of a benign etiology without findings of active or latent tuberculosis infection (Figure ). The patient was recommended to schedule a follow-up appointment in six months while maintaining a close observation of her symptoms.\nSix months later, her cough reoccurred after an initial improvement over the past few months. The cough was accompanied by occasional sputum. She denied fever, chills, night sweat, sore throat, chest pain, dyspnea, or weight loss. She had been in close contact with people who were diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection. She was recommended to undergo a pulmonary function test (PFT) as well as a chest CT for further evaluation. She was prescribed dextromethorphan for symptomatic relief, educated on the symptoms of active tuberculosis, and instructed to give frequent updates of her symptoms. CT with intravenous contrast revealed a high right paratracheal and medial right apical heterogeneous soft tissue with central areas of calcification (Figure ). She agreed to opt for a routine endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) to rule out malignancy.\nBronchoscopy inspection revealed unremarkable trachea, left upper lobe, left lingula, left lower lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe; but interestingly, no right upper lobe was observed. Furthermore, EBUS-TBNA showed a right paratracheal mass without surrounding lymphadenopathies that was biopsied and sent to pathology for analysis. The presumptive diagnosis for the right paratracheal mass was likely due to a nondeveloped right upper lung with associated scarring and atelectasis. The pathology report later confirmed the finding as there was no indication of malignancy or fungal infection. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

Two weeks prior, she was found to have bilateral tonsillitis, successfully treated with a 10-day course of amoxicillin before arrival to the ED.\nOn clinical examination, her vitals were slightly abnormal, with a fever of 100.7\u00b0F, a corresponding pulse of 104 beats per minute, and an elevated blood pressure at 135/70 mmHg. Neck examination revealed lymphadenopathy. Ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pharyngeal erythema, bilateral tonsillar erythema, bilateral tonsillar exudate, bilateral tonsillar swelling, and a left peritonsillar abscess (Figure ).\nThe patient had an elevated white blood cell count in response to the tonsillar infection (Table ). Head and neck computed tomography scans revealed moderate heterogeneous prominence of the bilateral palatine tonsils with a small tonsillar abscess (15 mm hypodensity on the left) (Figure ).\nAlso noted is an esophageal diverticulum (3.5 cm) and moderate somewhat symmetric bilateral neck lymphadenopathy particular to the submandibular regions with tonsillar abscess (Figure ).\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, seen by otorhinolaryngology, and treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Her symptoms subsided over a few days and the patient was discharged home. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "A 75-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of polymyositis on a maintenance dose of prednisone of 10 mg daily, diabetes mellitus, status post right nephrectomy presented to the ED with complaints of generalized weakness and drowsiness. At baseline, the patient was minimally mobile due to active polymyositis. The patient was less responsive and confused with episodes of falling from her bedside commode. She denied having a cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In the last week, she had close contact with her grandchildren, who experienced a flu-like illness without rash treated with an antibiotic.\nOn physical examination, her vitals were significant for elevated blood pressure of 174/82 mmHg, the temperature of 37.1 \u00b0C (98.7 \u00b0F), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Bilateral lower extremity swelling was present. On neurological exam, she was alert but not oriented on the place and time. Her Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 13. The patient showed decreased consciousness level, slowly followed commands, and slurred speech. Her reflexes were diminished: 2/4 in the bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellae, and Achilles. The rest of the exams were unremarkable without any focal neurological signs. Laboratory tests as noted in Table . The hepatitis panel was negative, and blood cultures showed no growth at 120 hours.\nComputed tomography (CT) brain without contrast showed scattered white matter hypodensities, which were nonspecific but compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.\nFurther ischemic workup was deferred due to acute kidney injury in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4. The patient had minimal responsiveness with a loop diuretic, and therefore she was started on hemodialysis for better volume management. MRI brain without contrast showed 14 mm high T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal intensity focus in the left temporal lobe, suspicious for primary versus metastatic neoplasm (Figure ). The neurologist was consulted and recommended a follow-up assessment with a gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain.\nCT chest/abdomen/pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast did not find any malignancy or metastatic disease. Given the cortical location of intracranial lesions, she was started prophylactically on levetiracetam 250 mg daily. Electroencephalograms (EEG) showed generalized slowing and triphasic waves. MRI with contrast was deferred due to worsening kidney. With her history of chronic steroid therapy, a lumbar puncture (LP) was considered and showed protein 75 mg/dL (15-60 mg/dL), glucose 55 mg/dL (50-80 mg/dL), WBC 22/mm3 (0-8/mm3), 7RBC/mm3 (<1RBC/mm3), with a pleocytosis of lymphocytic predominance. Meningitis/encephalitis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel detected HHV-6. The patient was started on acyclovir 530 mg IV, and the infectious disease was consulted. Afterward, the patient was started on ganciclovir 75 mg IV as an induction dose for 14 days as ganciclovir has been shown in studies to be active against HHV6. Serologic testing also revealed a positive IgG 1:40 (reference <1:10) but negative IgM. Serum HHV-6 viral load was undetectable.\nRepeat MRI brain without contrast after 14 days of treatment with ganciclovir showed chronic microvascular-type ischemic disease and some T2 shine through in the left frontal area (Figure ). The location of abnormality seen in the left temporal region in the subcortical white matter was less prominent. By this time, there was a significant improvement in her mental status. She was not placed on prophylaxis because there was no clear indication due to her marked symptomatic improvement and resolution of the area of abnormality in the left temporal region on the MRI. The patient has been discharged with her home regimen of prednisone 10 mg for polymyositis. Post-discharge at three-week outpatient follow-up, she was doing well without evidence of any further neurologic deterioration. What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "A previously healthy 23-year-old Japanese woman presented to the Internal Medicine Department in our hospital after 5 days of fever, sore throat, aphthous stomatitis, and enlargement of the bilateral cervical lymph nodes with tenderness. She experienced similar symptoms 1, 2, and 9 months ago, and in each case, these symptoms lasted for approximately 5 days regardless of therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics. There was no remarkable family history except for her mother's neuromyelitis optica. Her menstrual period was regular. She had taken no drugs except for multi-ingredient cold medication prescribed by a local clinic. She had never traveled abroad.\nOn admission, her body temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, and her other vital signs were within the normal ranges. On physical examination, aphthous stomatitis, enlargement of the bilateral submandibular lymph nodes with tenderness, pharyngeal erythema, and enlarged palatine tonsils with white exudates were observed (Figure ).\nLaboratory investigations revealed slightly elevated serum transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase level, 112 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase level, 92 IU/L) and immunoglobulin D (29.1 mg/dL) levels. Bacterial cultures from a throat swab and blood sample showed no growth. Anti-Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen immunoglobulin G and M titer were order of 160 and under the order of 10. Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen was not investigated. Computed tomography revealed enlargement of the bilateral submandibular lymph nodes with no evidence of other abnormal findings. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. The patient refused to undergo genetic examination.\nThe patient was diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome based on two clinical diagnostic criteria. She satisfied five of six items in Padeh's diagnosis criteria: monthly cyclic fever in any age group, possible aphthous stomatitis, cervical lymphadenitis, exudative tonsillitis with negative throat culture, completely asymptomatic during intervals, and rapid response to glucocorticoid. She also fulfilled four of five items in Thomas\u2019 criteria: regularly recurring fever under 5 years old; presence of at least one of these symptoms, aphthous stomatitis, cervical adenitis, or pharyngitis, without upper respiratory infection; exclusion of cyclic neutropenia; completely asymptomatic during intervals; normal growth and development. Her diagnosis was confirmed with no evidence of other possible febrile diseases.\nAfter admission, her symptoms recovered within a few days without any treatment. We prescribed cimetidine 800 mg per day to prevent recurrence. Although the aphthous stomatitis and enlarged cervical lymph node appeared a few days per month, none of the other symptoms were observed again. Moreover, the aphthous stomatitis has also stopped occurring 5 months after starting cimetidine therapy (Figure ). What is the patient's Centor Score?",

    "question": "On January 31, 2018, a usually healthy, 9-year old, non-Hispanic white female was screened for ORCHARDS eligibility (Figure ). She was a vaccinated (quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine on October 9, 2017) 4th-grade student who lived with both parents and two younger siblings. All family members had received the 2017/2018 influenza vaccine. A home visit was conducted 25 hours after symptom onset. Her moderate ILI was characterized by fever (measured temperature = 37.2\u00b0C after antipyretic), chills, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, headache, malaise, myalgia, anorexia, and sneezing. There was no recent travel, exposure to farm animals, or identified sick contact preceding onset. Nasal and oropharyngeal specimens were collected. Although the RIDT result was negative, rRT-PCR was positive for influenza A (H3N2) (cycle threshold value [Ct] = 31.48) and RPP was positive for coronavirus HKU1. At follow-up, she reported 2 days of absenteeism and continued cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia, and headache. There had been no medical follow-up or antiviral treatment. The rRT-PCR result from the subject's day 7 swab was negative for influenza. No other family members reported illness on day 0, but one sibling developed mild respiratory illness on day 6. All family members tested negative for influenza by rRT-PCR on day 0 and day 7.\nOn March 9, 2018, 37 days after the initial encounter, the subject was again screened due to a new ILI episode. A home visit was conducted 49 hours after symptom onset. Now 10 years old, the subject complained of significant symptoms including fever (measured temperature = 37.6\u00b0C after antipyretic), chills, cough, wheezing, nasal congestion, headache, malaise, myalgia, anorexia, burning eyes, and dizziness. Again, there was no recent travel, exposure to farm animals, or identified sick contact preceding onset. The subject's RIDT result was positive for influenza A, and rRT-PCR results confirmed the presence of influenza A (H3N2) (Ct = 26.48). At follow-up, she reported 2 days of absenteeism and continued fever, chills, cough, rhinorrhea, malaise, myalgia, headache, and anorexia. There had been no medical follow-up or antiviral treatment. The rRT-PCR results from the subject's day 7 swab continued to show influenza A (H3N2) (Ct = 33.30). No other family members reported illness on day 0 or day 7. All family members tested negative for influenza by rRT-PCR on day 0 and day 7.\nThe subject's initial specimen from each episode, collected on January 31 and March 9, 2018, was prepared for full genomic sequencing at the WSLH. Both A (H3N2) strains were of the hemagglutinin gene clade 3C2.a2. After WSLH performed a consensus sequence comparison between the two viruses collected from the subject, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified within the coding region of the HA protein. Only one SNP was non-synonymous and resulted in an isoleucine to leucine change at position 67 (in HA1). This particular polymorphism was near 100% frequency in the sequence reads and was four amino acids away from an established antibody epitope site (Site E). Both sequences (first isolate ORCH00001 and second isolate ORCH00002) were submitted to the GenBank\u00ae genetic sequence database and given accession numbers (MK262897 and MK262898, respectively).

    "question": "Subject 1 (S1), a 54-year old Chinese man, was well until 19 August 2006 when he developed sudden onset of high fever with chills and rigor. This was associated with cough, sore-throat and headache. There was no associated dyspnoea, tachypnoea, haemoptysis or chest pain on coughing. Besides the severe frontal throbbing headache, he had generalized body aches, myalgia and severe malaise. On the following day, he developed nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The vomitus consisted of food taken and was not bile-stained. The stool was described as watery without excessive mucous and it was non-malenic. The gastrointestinal symptom was associated with abdominal pain and loss of appetite. His illness was not relieved with self-medication of antipyretics. On review, there was no associated giddiness, blurring of vision, photophobia, skin bleeding or arthritis.\nHe sought medical treatment at the government health clinic in Kampar on 21 August 2006. At the outpatient clinic, he was noted to be febrile (an axillary temperature of 40.1 degree Celsius), ill-looking with a generalized body erythema that blanched on pressure and was more prominent over the face and upper trunk. He had mild conjunctivitis but there was no jaundice. His tonsils were enlarged and injected but there was no white exudate noted over the tonsils. He was not in any respiratory distress and his lungs were clear with good air entry on auscultation. Other systemic examination was essentially normal and there was no significant lymphadenopathy noted. A provisional diagnosis of influenza-like illness was made at which he was given a higher dose of anti-pyretic. His illness was noted to resolve on 23 August 2006 although he still appeared weak and lethargic.\nVenous blood samples were taken from the patient for full blood count analysis, and the results are shown in . These results indicated that his white blood cell and platelet counts were within normal limits although there was a relative lymphopenia in the blood sample taken at first examination.\nHis throat swab was taken on August 21 for virus isolation as described below.

No obvious causes of the vomiting were identified. Approximately 2 years prior to admission, the patient exhibited hyperpigmentation of the lips, in addition to fatigue, with a slow/stagnating increase in weight and height.\nOne month prior to admission, the patient had a seizure and was diagnosed with secondary epilepsy, based on an abnormal EEG. The patient was successfully treated with Topamax but continued to vomit >10 times/day. The patient was G2P2 with full-term normal delivery and a birth weight of 3.35 kg. The intellectual and physical development of the patient was similar to that of healthy children of the same age. There was no family history of genetic diseases, and the parents were in a non-consanguineous marriage.\nThe findings of the physical examination were as follows: BP, 85/55 mmHg; height, 92.7 cm; weight, 12 kg. The patient was mentally alert, and no significant anomalies were observed in the heart, lungs, abdomen, nervous system or external genitalia. A generalized hyperpigmentation was observed. Esophagography showed achalasia of the lower esophagus at the cardia. In the hospital, the patient was observed not to produce tears when crying. The results of a bilateral Schirmer test were 0 mm, which led to the diagnosis of alacrima. Further medical history confirmed that the alacrima had manifested at birth. Following the diagnosis of AS, the patient was treated with hydrocortisone replacement therapy (25 mg/m2), and the vomiting was alleviated.

There was no history of jaundice, fever, steatorrhea, or bleeding per rectum. There was no other significant medical or surgical history.\nThe patient had been treated with proton pump inhibitors, prokinetic agents by general practitioners, without any relief. His ultrasound examination and standing X-ray of abdomen had not shown any abnormality.\nPhysical examination was normal except minimal abdominal tenderness in epigastric, right hypochondriac region along with mild dehydration. His liver function tests, renal function tests, amylase, hemogram, and urinalysis were normal. Upper GI endoscopy was normal. A chest radiograph did not reveal air under the diaphragm.\nCT abdomen with contrast was done. In the study stomach and duodenum appeared connected to small intestine seen on right side giving a whirlpool appearance due to rotation of gut around the superior mesenteric artery. Superior mesenteric vein was seen on left of superior mesenteric artery [Figures and ]. Further distal bowel loops appeared collapsed. Thus the diagnosis of midgut malrotation with partial obstruction was confirmed.\nSurgical referral was made; he was treated with four-port laparoscopic Ladd's procedure. The ceacum was situated high with peritoneal bands passing across the duodenum. The peritoneum to the right of the ascending colon and caecum was incised and the anteriorly situated bands were stripped to free the duodenum.

    "question": "A 66-year-old man (body height, 168 cm; body weight, 88.5 kg) experienced dyspnea, a sensation of chest tightness, and back pain for a few days before he was brought to our hospital on an emergency basis. His symptoms became aggravated suddenly as he was about to get off a taxi on his way home from work. He presented with a history of close contact with a coworker with COVID-19 and was waiting for instructions from a public health center.\nIn the ambulance, the following conditions were documented: Glasgow Coma Scale score, E4V5M6; heart rate, 80/min and irregular; blood pressure, 100/60 mmHg; body temperature, 38.4\u00baC; oxygen saturation, 98% (O2 delivered with reservoir mask at a rate of 15 L/min). On admission, his white blood cell count was 22,300/\u00b5L; hemoglobin, 14.7 g/dL; platelet count, 35 \u00d7 104/\u00b5L; creatinine level, 2.23 mg/dL; creatine kinase level, 2582 IU/L; creatine kinase myocardial band level, 164 ng/mL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 97 mg/dL; high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol level, 19 mg/dL; triglyceride level, 173 mg/dL; hemoglobin A1c level, 7.9%; C-reactive protein level, 13.8 mg/dL; troponin T level, 9.640 ng/mL; N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, 11753 pg/mL; procalcitonin level, 0.62 ng/mL; d-dimer level, 16.34 \u00b5g/mL; and soluble fibrin level, 113.1 \u00b5g/mL. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation; ST-elevation in II, III, aVF, and V2\u2013V6 leads; and ST depression in aVR leads (Figure ). Echocardiography revealed severe hypokinesis extending from the anterior wall to the apex and the inferior wall in left ventricle, with an approximate ejection fraction of 20%. We diagnosed STEMI and decided to perform emergency coronary angiography (CAG). A chest radiograph showed infiltrative shadows in both lungs and tracheal intubation was performed in the emergency outpatient unit (Figure ). Continuous infusion of noradrenaline (0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min) was started because his systolic blood pressure dropped below 80 mmHg. After heparin (5,000 U) was administered intravenously, the patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization room.\nCAG was performed by cardiologists, emergency physicians, clinical engineers, nurses, and radiological technologists who donned appropriate personal protective equipment before entering the room. CAG revealed total occlusion of the middle of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD; Figure ). After a loading dose of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, 162 mg; clopidogrel, 300 mg), an intra-aortic balloon pump catheter was inserted, and a 7-Fr guiding catheter was inserted into the left coronary artery. We removed white material, which did not at a first glance appear to be a typical thrombus, with an aspiration catheter, but blood flow did not improve. The onset-to-device time and door-to-device time were 116 and 84 minutes, respectively. Subsequent intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) revealed several structures, which were thought to be thrombi; therefore, we performed plain old balloon angioplasty (Figure ). After the balloon was expanded, blood flow improved slightly in the LAD but not distally. Next, we placed an everolimus-eluting stent (4.0 \u00d7 38 mm) in the middle of the LAD, but peripheral blood flow was still not observed. Repeated IVUS revealed severe stenosis caused by plaque with thrombi. An additional balloon was inflated at the distal site, and a cutting balloon was also used. Another everolimus-eluting stent (2.25 \u00d7 38 mm) was placed at the distal site, but no blood flow improvements were seen angiographically.\nWe moved a double-lumen catheter to the distal LAD and performed CAG from the distal LAD, which revealed retrograde blood flow up to the middle of the LAD and collateral circulation from the septal branch to the RCA. Repeated IVUS examination revealed thrombi and plaque at the distal end of the stent and no intrastent blood flow (Figure ). Then, we tried to perform PCI for the total occlusion of RCA, but it was unsuccessful. At this point, 7 hours passed since the patient entered the cardiac catheterization room, and so we finished the procedure. The levels of activated clotting time during PCI were maintained at 280\u2013310 seconds. After PCI, pathological examination proved the aspirated white material was white thrombi. Chest computed tomography performed after PCI showed ground-glass opacities distributed unevenly in both the lungs, as well as left-sided pleural effusion (Figure ). After the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, he showed pulseless electrical activity, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved with 1 mg of epinephrine and one cycle of CPR. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was considered, but his family decided against it. The blood pressure was maintained through the continuous administration of noradrenaline, dobutamine, and adrenaline. His nasopharyngeal swab was tested with polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19-related pneumonia was diagnosed. Remdesivir treatment was initiated at a dose of 200 mg/day on the 5th day of hospitalization and continued at 100 mg/day. Because of the possibility of concomitant bacterial pneumonia, ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium (9 g/day) was also administered. However, the patient's oxygenation level worsened, and he died on the 7th day. It was difficult to confirm a main cause of death because we were not permitted to dissect patients due to COVID-19. We assumed that he had died from both cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction and septic shock due to covid-19 infection.

    "question": "A 20-years-old Caucasian male, presented to a district hospital with acute right lower quadrant pain from six hours before. Physical examination revealed abdominal pain, localized right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, body temperature slightly elevated (37.7\u00b0C), blood pressure 120/90 mmHg and heart rate 110/min. Blood tests showed leukocyte count at 12600/\u03bcL, the differential white account showing 75% neutrophils and hematocrit 35.9%. Abdominal and chest radiographs were normal. The primary diagnosis was acute appendicitis and appendectomy was decided. Entering the peritoneal cavity from a McBurney incision, the surgeon found large amount of blood and the surgery was transformed to exploratory laparotomy through a midline incision. The findings were enormous hepatomegaly and bleeding due to spontaneous rupture of the IV lobe of the liver. Active bleeding was managed with direct suture of identifiable vessels and absorbable gauze mesh. Postoperative course was uneventful, except of a continuous elevated body temperature (up to 38.5\u00b0C). The patient, five days after surgery, was referred to us in order to undergo further examinations for the nature of the liver abnormality. His medical history was unremarkable. He was previously in good health. His family and past history were not contributory. The patient weighted 65 Kg with 1.75 m height. He was in his right senses and well nourished. Yellow skin, icteric sclera, spider naevi and palmar erythema were not founded. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. Chest radiograph revealed no pulmonary pathology. The abdomen was swollen with the liver palpable. Laboratory tests showed liver function tests normal (before the initial surgery however, after the surgery SGOT, SGPT, LDH were altered three times the normal range) hepatitis markers of HAV, HBV, HCV, and HIV were negative and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 35 ng/ml. The patient underwent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen that showed hepatomegaly and a large hypodense lesion of the liver with multicystic appearance with septations and solid portions (Figure ). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in T2-weighted and Short Time Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences revealing hyperdense areas with intermixed hypodense septa (Figure ), and a thrombus in the inferior vena cava (Figure ). The differential diagnosis by the CT and MRI findings was giant hemangioma or cystic malignant lesion. Due to the size of the lesion and the previous history of spontaneous bleeding, it was decided that the patient must undergo surgery. In order to prevent pulmonary embolism, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted and fixated just below the renal veins. Two days later the patient underwent surgery. Primarily, thrombectomy and reconstruction of the inferior vena cava with removal of the filter was performed, followed by hepatectomy of I\u2013IV and VIII lobe of the liver. Intraoperative biopsy demonstrated malignancy or sarcoma of the liver. Frozen section on the remaining liver was performed and showed normal liver tissue. The patient after surgery presented with life threatening bleeding and protean coagulation abnormalities, symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation, due to massive blood transfusion. The patient died the second postoperative day due to uncontrolled bleeding caused of the developing of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Pathologic review of the specimen revealed a 1580 gm left and part of right hepatic lobe, with a 30 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 9 cm tumor mass and the histological examination showed malignant sarcomatous tissue with spares giant neoplastic cells (head arrow) and residual hepatocytes (arrow) suggestive of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (Figure ). Sarcomatous tissue with severe atypia of the neoplastic cells and focal presence of giant cells partially with myoblastic characteristics was also present (Figure ). Residual hepatocytes stained positive in immunohistochemical stain for cytoceratinin 8\u201318, and showed infiltration by the sarcomatous tissue (DAB technique).

    "question": "A 42-year-old Caucasian Finnish woman was scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to typical symptoms and radiological findings of gallstones. She was obese (89 kg, BMI = 33), even though she had managed to lose weight by 20 kg six months prior to presentation. She was using sibutramine and oral contraceptives as regular medication.\nSurgery was uneventful, but on the second postoperative day, the general state of our patient started to deteriorate, resulting in anuria and difficulty of breathing, admission into the intensive care unit (ICU), endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed upon ICU admission because of suspected biliary tract leakage. However, no signs of leakage were observed. Computed tomography (CT) examination revealed fluid around her liver, while her pancreas could not be visualized. Her plasma amylase concentration was elevated, thus confirming the diagnosis of pancreatitis.\nDue to decreased renal function, she was commenced on continuous hemodiafiltration therapy on the third day and continued until the 10th postoperative day. Propofol infusion for sedation, supplemented with intravenous oxycodone boluses, was started as part of our hospital's standard therapy in order to facilitate mechanical ventilation and other treatment procedures. Propofol sedation was continued until the 36th postoperative day. Upon the decision of weaning, her attending physician decided to add dexmedetomidine infusion into the sedation regimen 17 days after her surgery.\nWeaning was not successful, and tracheostomy was performed on the 18th postoperative day. On the 19th postoperative day, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and explorative laparotomy were performed because the general condition of our patient again started to deteriorate. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis with severe inflammation of her abdominal cavity was discovered. This deterioration prevented further weaning. Our aim was to stop propofol infusion after starting her on dexmedetomidine, but in order to achieve the desired level of sedation (light to moderate, Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) levels 3 to 4 []), propofol infusion had to be continued despite the already high dose of dexmedetomidine she was receiving.\nOur patient later required yet another laparotomy because of elevated abdominal pressure. This surgery did not reveal any additional findings, but this time her abdominal wall had to be left open, and sedation had to be continued. Vacuum-assisted closure therapy was established on the 22nd and continued until the 34th postoperative day. Weaning was started again on the 36th postoperative day. Clonidine infusion was started on the 40th postoperative day, while the dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued on the following day, on the 24th day of its administration.\nOur patient's abdominal wall was finally closed on the 47th day, and the clonidine infusion was stopped on the 51st postoperative day. The tracheostomy cannula was removed on the 54th day and she was admitted to a surgical ward on the 55th postoperative day for further recovery.\nDuring dexmedetomidine sedation, her plasma albumin level was low (8.4 g/L to 11.6 g/L) and her creatinine level was slightly elevated (23 \u03bcmol/L to 126 \u03bcmol/L). Meanwhile, her bilirubin level and international normalized ratio (INR) were both normal at 5 \u03bcmol/L to 16 \u03bcmol/L and 1.1 to 1.4, respectively.\nAt 14 months later, her recovery is still incomplete. Already in the ICU she complained that her vision is impaired. According to the consulting ophthalmologist, this symptom is likely due to ischemic optic neuropathy. At present she can only see movement and light with her right eye. The vision of her left eye is also severely impaired, but she is able to read using special equipment for the visually impaired. Additionally, her everyday life is harmed by numbness and weakness of her extremities, which is caused by critical illness polyneuropathy. Despite these impairments, her aim is to return to work.\nSamples for the measurement of dexmedetomidine concentrations in her plasma were drawn at 8-hour intervals as directed by the plan of the pharmacokinetic study she was recruited in. The concentrations were determined using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (PE Sciex API4000 instrument; PE Sciex, Foster City, California, US) as described previously [].\nThe rates of the dexmedetomidine and propofol infusions, as well her plasma concentration results of dexmedetomidine, are presented in Figure . In calculating the dexmedetomidine dose, we used her preoperative weight of 89 kg.\nBecause the dose rate of dexmedetomidine remained constant for relatively long periods of time during three separate intervals, we calculated the plasma clearance of dexmedetomidine during these intervals by dividing the infusion rate by the plasma concentration. The calculated clearance was 55 L/h, 92 L/h and 87 L/h during the 2nd to 6th, 14th to 20th and 21st to 23rd day of the dexmedetomidine infusion, respectively.

    "question": "A 36-year-old Caucasian male, with a past medical history of bilateral lung transplant for cystic fibrosis in 2017 complicated by a rejection episode, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, hypertension, pancreatic insufficiency, anxiety, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic rhinosinusitis, and peripheral neuropathy presented with an 18-month history of progressive muscle weakness. The patient had a double lung transplant three years prior to the start of the muscle weakness. He had excellent exercise performance from a few months post-transplant, riding a road bike regularly and even participating in the Transplant Olympics. He experienced an episode of rejection about three years and three months after his initial transplant and required treatment with anti-thymocyte globulin. Although lung function was reduced after his rejection episode, he was still biking regularly up to 15 miles at a time. A few months after this episode of rejection, he developed some peripheral neuropathy symptoms, and therapy with pregabalin at a dose of 100 mg twice daily was initiated. Weakness started within two months after pregabalin therapy was initiated and slowly progressed. He was no longer able to ride a bike and had difficulty rising from a squatted position, or standing up from a chair. He denied shortness of breath, chest pain, peripheral edema, orthopnea, or paroxysmal dyspnea. There were no symptoms of hypothyroidism and thyroid function was normal. His daily medications included mycophenolate, tacrolimus, prednisone, pregabalin azithromycin, pramipexole, ursodiol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, metoprolol, omeprazole, oxycodone, ativan, melatonin, simethicone, calcium, sertraline, Humalog insulin, pancrelipase, magnesium oxide, methylcobalamin, a multivitamin tablet, and tramadol on an as-needed basis.\nVital signs included a blood pressure of 120/82, a heart rate of 67, a respiratory rate of 18, and a temperature of 99 F. He weighed 76.6 kilograms with a BMI of 21.6, his oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. His general build and nourishment were normal, his fingernails showed mild clubbing. His neurological exam showed the presence of mild proximal muscle weakness; His heart had a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. Peripheral pulses were normal. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Laboratory testing revealed an elevated level of creatinine kinase and raised AST and ALT levels. The patient's pulmonary function tests showed a mild decrease in his FEV1 and FVC which subsequently improved while his muscle fatigue continued to worsen. A bronchoscopy performed to investigate his reduced exercise tolerance showed some purulent secretions and cultures grew methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus. Biopsy performed showed no evidence of rejection (ISHLT Grade A0, B0). Repeat labs drawn the next month showed a persistently elevated creatinine kinase level (Figure ).\nA muscle biopsy was subsequently performed for further assessment. It showed scattered degenerating and necrotic muscle fibers with an associated macrophage infiltrate and phagocytic response. A prominent acute neutrophilic or chronic lymphocytic inflammatory reaction was not seen and centrally vacuolated myofibers were not identified. Taken together with the clinical history, these histologic findings were consistent with a drug-induced acute necrotizing myopathy (Figure ).\nUpon reviewing the patient's medication for potential causes, mycophenolate and tacrolimus were viewed as the most likely causative agents, and the decision made to switch to cyclosporine and sirolimus. The patient did not report any improvement in his symptoms over a three-month time period. Creatinine kinase levels continued to rise despite the change in his medication regimen and the patient grew increasingly despondent. The decision was made to discontinue pregabalin. The patient noted a dramatic improvement in muscle weakness over the next few weeks and the creatinine kinase levels improved from 1023 U/L to 256 U/L (normal range: 49-320 U/L) within a month time period. Within 3 months, the patient was now able to walk on the treadmill for a half-hour and ride his bike again. Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",

    "question": "An 11-month old girl was admitted with severe kwashiorkor, acrodermatitis enteropathica, diarrhoea, and urinary tract infection. She had a three-week history of diarrhoea and four-day history of fever. She was born at term, following an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. She was almost exclusively breastfed during 11 months. Intake of solid foods was very poor. In the medical history, there was nothing eventful until three weeks before admission. Her parents were uneducated, appeared unaware of some basic elements of childcare, and their children did not receive regular medical care. They had not noticed when she began to show growth failure and insufficient weight gain. The parents were first cousins. They and their first child were healthy.\nOn examination, weight (6.470 kg), length (61 cm), and head circumference (42 cm) of the study girls were below the third centile for age. She had the typical features of kwashiorkor (generalized oedema, hypopigmented skin lesion on pretibial area, rotund sugar baby appearance, diaper dermatitis, abdominal distention, irritability, and thin, sparse hair) and rickets (obvious rachitic rosary, flaring of the wrists, craniotabes). Gross motor milestones were slightly retarded. There was no ataxia and nystagmus.\nLaboratory evaluation was remarkable for a serum albumin of 2.6 g/dL, urea nitrogen of <6 mg/dL, and normocytic anaemia (7.5 g/dL). The serum alkaline phosphatase was markedly elevated, phosphorus was low, calcium was low normal, 25(OH)-vitamin D level was low, and the parathyroid hormone level was markedly elevated. Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal. Evaluation for other causes of hypo-albuminaemia was negative.\nTherapy for kwashiorkor was instituted, including gradual refeeding, initially via a nasogastric tube with a milk-based paediatric nutritional supplement. Supplements of vitamin D and calcium were provided. The oedema began to resolve after nutritional support. Serum zinc level was evaluated because an acrodermatitis enteropathica-like desquamative skin eruption persevered in the perineal areas (). Zinc level was in the normal range, and so, further investigation for a metabolic disorder was considered. After urine and blood samples were sent to the laboratory, our patient died on the seventh day of admission due to pneumonia. Chromatography of urinary amino acids revealed massive generalized neutral aminoaciduria and indicanuria. These amino acids were detected at low levels in the serum. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of Hartnup disease was made after her death. Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",

    "question": "A male patient, born in 1990, first presented with a kidney stone when he was 10 years old, but the stone had passed spontaneously, and no further testing was done at that time. At the age of 20, he presented with a second episode of renal colic. Proteinuria and microscopic haematuria were also noticed, for which he was referred to a nephrologist.\nOn examination, he was a lean young man with normal height and stature. Height was 175 cm, and weight was 59 kg. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood pressure was 107/74 mmHg.\nLaboratory examination showed an elevated serum creatinine of 130 \u03bcmol/L (1.44 mg/dL) (eGFR 62 mL/min/1.73 m2). Serum alkaline phosphatase level was 122 U/L with elevated bone fraction of alkaline phosphatase. Other blood tests were normal. Twenty-four-hour urine collection showed proteinuria of 2.981 g/day consisting mainly of low-molecular-weight proteins. Calciuria was 8.3 mmol/day (334 mg/day) or 5.7 mg/kg/day (normal < 4). Urine sediment analysis was normal ().\nUltrasonography, CT scan and MRI revealed normal kidney size and contour but bilateral multiple cysts. The cysts were mainly localized in the cortex, and they had a benign simple appearance. Furthermore, bilateral nephrolithiasis and intraparenchymal calcification consistent with nephrocalcinosis were seen ( and ).\nRenal biopsy had been performed in another centre and had shown normal light microscopy, normal electron microscopy, and negative immunofluorescence.\nAfter the acute renal colic, transurethral stone extraction was performed. Stone analysis showed a stone consisting of calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate.\nFamily history was negative for renal disease or renal colic. The patient had no siblings. The parents underwent a renal ultrasound examination: both had normal morphology of their kidneys without cysts, but one asymptomatic nephrolithiasis was found in the father.

    "question": "A 20-year-old Caucasian male (1.75 m tall and 76 kg (BMI 24.8)), was admitted to the medical department for persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor. Persistent symptoms started at home 4 days before and he assumed clarithromycin as empiric antibiotic therapy. The physical examination showed jaundice, dry mucous membranes, pharyngeal hyperemia in the tonsillar region and soft palate, and left laterocervical lymphadenopathy. He was tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute) and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) in room air was 92%. The abdominal palpation revealed hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory tests showed a white blood count (WBC) of 8000 cells/mcL with 74% neutrophils, thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 31,000/mcL), total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, AST 150 UI/L, ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly ().\nThe neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein ().\nOn the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight) spectrometry -Vitek \u00aeMS Blood cultures performed at admission and on the second day and collected in standard anaerobic blood culture bottles were positive ().\nThe association of retropharyngeal abscess with thrombosis of the anterior jugular and involvement of other organs systemically and the microbiology led to the diagnosis of Lemierre\u2019s syndrome. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (18 g/day, continuous infusion), there was a rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of the respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations (mean arterial pressure (MAP) constantly <65 mmHg). This picture suggested a progression towards a septic shock status. Consequently, the patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\nA multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierre\u2019s septic syndrome. It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) ().\nThe source control was planned in a sterile environment. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. Unfortunately, although the procedure revealed purulent material, surgeons were unable to collect suitable samples for microbiological testing.\nAt ICU admission, the patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and the need for deep sedation (propofol, remifentanil, and clonidine), and mechanical ventilation through protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg and driving pressure < 15 cmH2O) and high FiO2 (80%). The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 12, predicting a high mortality rate (50%) [].\nAbout antibiotic therapy, metronidazole (500 mg q8hr, intravenously) was added to piperacillin/tazobactam (started empirically at hospital admission). This antibiotic therapy was based on anecdotal clinical evidence because, due to the lack of cards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes in the laboratory, the antibiogram was not performed.\nHemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin (also known as arginine-vasopressin or anti-diuretic hormone) (EMPRESSIN\u00ae AOP Orphan Pharmaceutical Group) starting with norepinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min and argipressin at 0.03 IU/min to maintain a MAP > 65 mmHg and lactic acid < 2 mmol/L. On day 2, the drug synergism allowed the rapid reduction of the norepinephrine and argipressin dosages (0.1 mcg/kg/min and 0.025 IU/min, respectively) ().\nOn the same day (day 2), there was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved ().\nDespite the adequate MAP (>65 mmHg), from the 3rd to the 6th day of ICU admission, there was a new worsening of the clinical status. It featured anemia (worse value 6.8 g/dL) without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring (Edwards EV1000\u2122 device) showed a hyperdynamic septic state (Cardiac Output 15 L/min, Systemic Vascular Resistance 300 dynes/seconds/cm). Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, on the 8th day, hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) was added to argipressin and norepinephrine. This approach led to a paramount hemodynamic improvement. From the 8th day of hospitalization, there was a progressive reduction of the dose of both vasoconstrictors until the suspension of norepinephrine, on day 9, and argipressin, on day 12 of ICU stay. Moreover, there was an important decrease in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (from 12 on ICU admission to 7 on day 9).\nThe worsening of the clinical status and the anemia were associated with bilirubin and cytokines rise. The inflammatory response was treated by 4 cycles of continuous hemofiltration (from 4th to 7th day). At the end of the procedure, there was an unexpected rise in D-dimers and in bilirubin values, up to 15.3 mg/dL (10th day), as well as hyperpyrexia. Nevertheless, these findings improved within 24 h.\nHeparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia (enoxaparin 6000 U/day at the beginning and 4000 U twice a day after normalization of the platelet count) monitoring D-dimer values and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy.\nOn the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion and a new CT was carried out. It showed a persistence of the known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as the normalization of hemodynamic parameters at monitoring. The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program. After the discharge to the rehabilitation care unit, the young man was in good health condition. At the first follow up, performed 15 days after ICU admission, the CT scan showed better lungs ventilation, absence of retropharyngeal abscess, laterocervical lymphadenopathy, and internal jugular thrombosis. Hepatosplenomegaly and some cavitary lungs lesions were found. Another thoracic CT scan was performed after 3 months. It demonstrated an improvement of both the lung lesions and hepatosplenomegaly.

    "question": "This is a case of a 70-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history of hypertension and osteoarthritis who presented with a two-week history of dizziness. He also reported a few episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. Four days prior to presentation, he was unable to carry on with his daily activities due to generalized weakness which prompted him to seek medical attention. Upon further review of systems, he was admitted with night sweats, subjective fevers, and loss of appetite resulting in a 40-pound weight loss over the past few months.\nOn physical exam, the patient had skin and conjunctival pallor. Vitals revealed orthostatic hypotension. Laboratory investigations indicated significant microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dL (14\u201318 g/dL), decreased from his baseline of 14.5 g/dL one year prior, and a MCV of 66 fL (79\u201393.9 fL). He had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.7 (4.5\u201311.0 K/UL) as well has thrombocytosis of 529 K/UL (130\u2013400 K/UL). On chemistry, he was found to have acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.42 mg/dL (0.7\u20131.3 mg/dL) and BUN of 34 mg/dL (9\u201323 mg/dL) from a baseline creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. He was also found to have hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.2 mmol/L (3.5\u20135.1 mmol/L) and metabolic alkalosis with an elevated CO2 level of 34 mg/dL (9\u201323 mg/dL). Analysis of laboratory values (AKI, mildly elevated leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis, and hypokalemia) hinted towards dehydration likely resulting volume depletion from vomiting. Laboratory values resolved with hydration. In addition, the patient had a positive stool guaiac suggestive of GI bleed. He was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. He denied recent history of hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia and had an unremarkable colonoscopy 5 years prior to presentation.\nDue to symptomatic anemia, weight loss, and obstructive symptoms in the setting of a GI bleed, he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy. EGD revealed severe diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis () with biopsies consistent with chronic gastritis and no malignant features. Colonoscopy showed localized, severe colitis at the cecum that was erythematous, friable, and ulcerative (). There was also extraluminal compression of the cecum with protrusion of the ileocecal valve and luminal narrowing ().\nDue to the extraluminal compression of the cecum, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast was obtained. This ultimately revealed a cecal mass measuring 12 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 4.7 cm with the bulk of the mass protruding into the terminal ileum causing high-grade narrowing of the lumen (). Lymphadenopathy was localized to the right lower quadrant, and no distant lymphadenopathy was observed elsewhere (). CT of the chest (with and without IV contrast) that was also done did not show pulmonary nodules, pleural or pericardial effusions, or lymphadenopathy to suggest distant disease.\nSubsequently, surgery was consulted, and due to his presentation with obstructive symptoms and symptomatic anemia secondary to the seen cecal mass, the patient underwent a right hemicolectomy. Pathology from both colonoscopy and right hemicolectomy showed MCL of cecum. The lymphoma cells expressed cyclin D, with characteristic cytogenetic abnormality of t (11; 14) (q13; q32). A high index of Ki-67 of 65% indicates adverse prognosis (Figures and ). MCL was also present in pericolonic lymph nodes.\nInitially, the patient declined further workup and treatment including chemotherapy and bone marrow biopsy. Nonetheless, two months after discharge, he presented to the Oncology Clinic willing to undergo further evaluation and treatment. At this time, PET/CT scan revealed advanced disease with hypermetabolic lymph nodes within the mediastinum and retroperitoneum, as well as diffuse omental caking and bilateral malignant pleural effusions; no uptake on the bony structures was identified. The patient was now diagnosed with advanced disease and stage IV MCL, contrary to initial presentation where lymphadenopathy was limited to the right lower quadrant. The patient was started on chemotherapy consisting of rituximab and bendamustine of which he received 2 rounds before being lost to follow-up again.

    "question": "A thin (41 kg) 85-year-old female presented with a 10-hour history of severe RUQ pain, nausea and vomiting. Her background included multiple lower abdominal laparotomies for gynaecological procedures, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. There were no clinical features of systemic upset. Her examination revealed a tender and guarded RUQ. Liver function tests were normal, white cell count was mildly elevated. Ultrasound demonstrated a distended gallbladder, without cholelithiasis and an asymmetrical gallbladder wall thickening to 8.5 mm. CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis, V-shaped superior portion of the gallbladder, low and horizontal lying gallbladder with hypoattenuation of the gallbladder wall compared with surrounding visceral structures (Figures -). After 24 hours of observation whilst on broad-spectrum antibiotics and simultaneous fluid resuscitation, the patient failed to clinically improve. The decision was made to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nIntra-operative findings revealed a large, necrotic, completely torted and floating gallbladder. Its only attachment appeared to be the cystic duct and cystic artery on which the gallbladder had twisted 360 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction (Figures -). Principles of the operation include derotation then cholecystectomy and intra-operative cholangiogram. To establish the required critical view, it was necessary to unravel the torted pedicle before proceeding with the dissection. The cholecystectomy was otherwise routine. Gallbladder was retrieved in an endoscopic specimen retrieval bag and decompressed in the bag to allow delivery of the specimen and prevent spillage of bile intra-abdominally.\nOur patient\u2019s discharge was delayed by an asymptomatic demand-related cardiac ischaemia, requiring 24-hour period of observation.

There were no neurologic complaints. He was immunocompromised with an absolute CD4 count of 6 cells/\u03bcL after being off antiretroviral therapy for the past 10 years. He had been working full time as a car mechanic and reported having multiple indoor pet cats throughout his life. The patient was cachectic and frail appearing but with an otherwise unremarkable physical exam. Laboratory showed a HIV viral load of >130,000 copies/mL with Toxoplasma IgG > 700 IU/mL. Laboratory was unremarkable otherwise with Toxoplasma IgM < 3 AU/mL, no fecal ova or parasites observed, negative cryptococcal antigen, negative enteric cultures, and a nonreactive rapid plasma reagin. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated diffuse circumferential colonic wall thickening with prominent mesenteric lymph nodes (). Bidirectional endoscopy was performed with esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing large ulcerations in the gastric cardia and fundus. Severe inflammation and ulcerations in the right colon and cecum were noted on colonoscopy (). Biopsies were taken from both the gastric and colonic ulcerations. Histologic examination revealed markedly active gastritis and colitis with ulceration and ischemic changes (). Many free tachyzoites and encysted forms were identified in the lamina propria as well as the cytoplasm of epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells (Figures , , and ). Immunohistochemistry (polyclonal rabbit anti-Toxoplasma, 1 : 200; Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, Calif) confirmed the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis ().

    "question": "A 68-year-old Japanese female was transferred to the ED by ambulance because she had fainted after dizziness. Her past medical history was hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, and she was on multiple medications. She had been anorexic for ~1 month. She was an ex-smoker and a social drinker.\nOn admission, her mental status was recovered and her conscious levels were E4V5M6 (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)). Her physical findings and vital signs were as follows: height 139.0 cm, body weight 52.3 kg, body mass index 27.1 kg/m2, blood pressure 128/75 mmHg, heart rate 152 beats/min with irregularity, body temperature 36.8\u00b0C, oxygen saturation on room air 98% and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. Her physical examinations, which included her conjunctiva, cervical lymph nodes, chest, heart and abdomen, revealed normal findings.\nBaseline laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) 10 300/\u03bcL\u2191, hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 34 mg/dL\u2191, creatinine 4.09 mg/dL\u2191, sodium 128 mEq/L\u2193, potassium 2.6 mEq/L\u2193, chlorides 87 mEq/L\u2193, total protein 7.1 g/dL, albumin 4.2 g/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.07 mg/dL, glucose 262 mg/dL\u2191 and \u03b2-glycated hemoglobin 5.9%. Urinalysis revealed protein (1+), sugar (4+) and ketones (+) with no blood cells or casts. Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, but there were no abnormal findings on chest radiograph or on brain or thoracicoabdominal computed tomography (CT).\nThese findings suggested that her AMS might be caused by one or more conditions, namely, hyponatremia, ketonuria, hyperglycemia and acute kidney injury (uremia), which were presumably due to dehydration, diabetic ketosis and chronic kidney disease. She was hospitalized and treated with electrolytes, including sodium chloride and potassium chloride, and insulin.\nAlthough her blood electrolytes, serum glucose and renal function gradually improved, general conditions, including her consciousness, deteriorated. On the third day after hospitalization, her cognitive function became impaired with reduced conscious levels to E4V3M4 (GCS). Abnormal breaths with apnea and tachypnea accompanied by a fever (37.8\u00b0C) appeared, and glossoptosis was found (Fig. ). Both an oropharyngeal airway and bite block were placed in order to maintain her airway, which is we realized that she suffered from multiple, painful dental caries, but no findings of within the oropharynx.\nLaboratory results on the hospital Day 3 were as follows: WBC 14 800/\u03bcL with 94.1% neutrophils\u2191 and CRP 0.08 mg/dL. There were no abnormal findings on chest radiograph, brain or thoracicoabdominal CT, brain magnetic resonance imaging, or spinal fluid examination.\nBecause no abnormalities were detected in the central nervous system, empiric treatment was initiated with 2.25 g q6hr of piperacillin/tazobactam for fever of unknown origin presumably caused by bacterial infection(s).\nOn hospital Day 6, a dentist examined her teeth and found 15 dental caries, then dental extractions were performed on four teeth. In particular, pus was discharged from the left upper canine with gingival swelling, which was diagnosed with acute apical abscess.\nOn hospital Day 7, her mental status was completely normal (Fig. ), indicating that apical abscess was acute, severe inflammation of the dental pulp with minimal chance of spontaneous recovery [\u2013] and may have caused her AMS and abnormal breathing. Although two sets of blood cultures sampled on hospital Day 3 were negative, bacterial culture from the dental pus sampled on hospital Day 6 yielded methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic treatment was de-escalated to 1 g q8hr of cefazolin on hospital Day 13 and was completed on hospital Day 20. The patient fully recovered and was discharged on hospital Day 23.

    "question": "The patient is a 13-years old female referred to our center for evaluation of dysmorphic features and congenital heart disease. She was born at term with uneventful prenatal and peripartum period. She was noticed after birth to have hypoplastic right thumb. Her parents, who are not related, have 4 other normal children. When she was initially evaluated in our center at the age of 6 and \u00bd years, her examination showed a head circumference of 45 cm (4.7 SD below the mean), a weight of 14.6 kg (4 SD below the mean) and a height of 100.5 cm (3 SD below the mean). She had upslanting palpebral fissures, bulbous nose, malformed right ear, retrognathia, low posterior hairline, webbed neck, and widely spaced nipples. The chest and abdominal examination was unremarkable. The cardiovascular examination revealed normal first heart sound, fixed split of second heart sound, and a systolic murmur grade 3/6 over the left upper sternal border. She had normal tone, power and deep tendon reflexes. The musculoskeletal examination revealed right thumb hypoplasia with absent thenar muscles, absent extensor pollicis longus, and thumb extensors. There was significant instability of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the right thumb. Skeletal survey revealed ankylosis between C3, C4 and C5 spine. The thoraacolumbar spine and the long tubular bones of both upper limbs were osteopenic. The right fifth metacarpal bone was short with hypoplasia of the first right metacarpal bone. The epiphysis of the first metacarpal bone was absent bilaterally. There was mild bilateral subluxation of the hip joints. The tibia and fibula were normal bilaterally. Hallux valgus at the interphalangeal joint was seen bilaterally. There was coning of the epiphysis of the second to fourth toes bilaterally. Echocardiogram revealed large secundum atrial septal defect measuring 12 mm with left to right shunt. Ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis indicated that the left kidney was rotated and ectopic lying down into the pelvis.\nAs part of routine diagnostic procedures a high-resolution GTW-banding study was carried on the patient\u2019s sample. No gross abnormality was detected. Then, an aCGH experiment was performed as a further clinical screening and indicated an interstitial duplication pointed by 33 oligonucleotide probes on 5q35.2-q35.3. An interphase FISH using a probe (CTD-2301A4) within the duplicated interval re-confirmed the findings. To better characterize the duplication a high-resolution array (Cytogenetics Whole-Genome 2.7 M) from Affymetrix Inc. (Affymetrix Inc., San Paolo, CA, US) was utilized to further delineate the gain missed during the initial standard microscope based-karyotyping. This particular chip array utilizes 2.7 million markers including 400,000 SNP probes that provide whole-genome coverage with the one of the highest density coverage among the present platforms. Based on Affymetrix\u2019s cytogenetic assay results, the duplication extends from 175,349,728 to 177,347,753 bp (hg19) and comprises 58 genes targeted by more than 600 SNP and copy number (CN) probes covering approximately 2.0 Mb (Fig. ). In comparison to the previously published duplications this duplication seems novel and does not share breakpoints with the compared cases.

    "question": "A 53-year-old, 56 kg weight and 154 cm height female was having pseudomyxoma peritonei, diffusely deposited in the abdomen and peritoneal surfaces as well as in the left lung and pleural space. She was a case of hypothyroidism since last 4 years on oral thyroxine 50 mcg once a day. Her laboratory investigations were within normal limits except that liver function test showed serum albumin of 2.1 g/L initially which improved to 3.4 g/L with high protein formula feed for 1-month period of evaluation and optimization. Preoperative electrocardiogram and 2D-echocardiogram were normal. Her effort tolerance was more than 4 METs. Preoperative pulmonary function test (PFT) showed FEV1 1.13 Litres (47.3% of predicted) with moderate restriction due to the lung metastases with small airway obstruction. Patient was started on bronchodilator therapy for the same. Diffusion capacity (DLCO) was 81% of predicted. A written informed consent was taken for surgery and anaesthesia. She was kept fasting for solid food for 8 hours. She received clear carbohydrate drink in previous evening and morning of surgery as per institutional protocol. In the operating room, ECG, non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry were attached and base line parameters noted. A 16G intravenous cannula was secured and epidural catheter was placed in T7-8 interspace in left lateral position. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (100 mcg), propofol (110 mg) and vecuronium (6mg) and was maintained on sevoflurane in a gaseous mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide. The monitoring was then advanced to include invasive arterial blood pressure with pulse pressure variation (PPV), central venous pressure and monitoring with the help of FloTrac including cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume (SV), stroke volume index and stroke volume variation (SVV), as well as oesophageal temperature monitoring. CRS phase was started and total peritonectomy with total abdominal hysterectomy plus omenectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy and liver portal metastasis clearance was done. Bilateral diaphragmatic stripping was done for metastatic deposits. Debulking surgery of left thorax (large deposits over left lung) through left phrenotomy was done for pleural and lung PMP. A small part of left lower lobe was also resected. During debulking of thorax, a very low tidal volume (4 ml/kg) ventilation was started. CRS phase lasted for 12 hours with a total volume loss (blood mixed) during CRS phase was 6.5 liter, mostly constituted by jelly-like mucinous material. During abdominal debulking, fluid therapy was guided by PPV and SVV but after opening of pleura fluid therapy was guided by delta SV with optimum SV and target SV (10% less than optimum SV) calculation. Six units of packed red cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 500 ml of 20% albumin was given along with 6 liters of crystalloids and low dose (<0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min) nor-adrenaline support was needed toward end of CRS phase. Urine output target during CRS was more than 0.5 ml/kg/h. Total peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was 39 with completion cytoreduction score of 1. HITAC in form of adriamycin 15 mg/m2 and mitomycin 15 mg/m2 was given in left side of thorax with open diaphragm and whole abdomen for 60 minutes with help of Belmont pump. A urine output of more than 2 ml/kg/h was targeted during HITAC phase by use of cold fluids. Temperature control was done with cold fluids at 6\u00b0C and ice packs on neck and axilla. The maximum temperature reached was 37.8\u00b0C after 40 minutes of starting HITAC. ScvO2 at end of CRS was 75.6% and at the end of HITAC phase it was 83.4%. Serum lactates increased from 1.10 mmol/L at the end of CRS phase to 8.02 mmol/L at the end of 60 minutes HITAC phase. Peak airway pressure increased from 23 to 30 cm of H2O during HITAC phase. At the end of procedure loop ileostomy was done and diaphragm was closed, drains were put in abdomen and bilateral chest tubes were placed and abdomen was closed. The patient maintained a moderate metabolic acidosis of pH 7.2-7.3 throughout the HITAC. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) mechanically ventilated and sedated. In the ICU, she was electively ventilated for 48 hours. The trachea was extubated on high flow nasal oxygenation by Optiflow\u2122. On postoperative day (POD) 1, parenteral nutrition was started. Adequate pain relief was achieved by epidural infusion of local anaesthetic for 4 days along with intravenous paracetamol 1 g 6 hourly. She was shifted out from ICU on POD 7. PFT repeated on POD 13 showed severe restriction with small airway obstruction, FEV1 0.91 Liter (38% of predicted), and fall in DLCO from preoperative 81% to 59% in postoperative period. She was discharged from hospital on POD 15. Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",

    "question": "A 5-month-old female presented with a 3-day history of coughing and recurrent vaginal discharge and poor weight over the last 3 months. The discharge was said to have been present since birth, on and off, and it had worsened in the 3 days prior to presentation. Of note was that the child had been treated for conjunctivitis when she was 4 days old and for an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) at 10 weeks of age. She was exclusively breastfed and, despite adequate milk supply, was small for her age. The mother was HIV negative and had not been screened for syphilis during pregnancy. There is a history of maternal febrile illness during pregnancy that was nonspecific.\nOn examination, she was alert, pale, and small for her age (Wt 5.4 kg, length 64 cm, Z score: \u22123 SD to \u22122 SD). Vital signs were normal and, on respiratory examination, the child had bilateral crepitations. Abdominal and cardiovascular examinations were normal. Examination of the skin revealed generalized hyperpigmented spots (healing dermatitis). Genitourinary examination was also normal. RPR was reactive and with titers (1:4).

    "question": "A 7-day-old girl was admitted to our hospital with a fever and poor feeding. Her family history was unremarkable. Group B Streptococcus was not detected in the vaginal and stool culture of her mother before delivery. She denied any exposure to toxins, drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. The neonate was delivered by vacuum assisted vaginal delivery, at the gestational age of 40 weeks and 3 days. Her birth weight was 3,436 g and Apgar score was 2/9. Before her birth, her heart rate was low, and suction delivery was performed because of shoulder dystocia. To alleviate her respiratory distress, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was performed, and her respiratory condition immediately improved. She did not receive any antibiotics or parenteral nutrition. Auditory brainstem response testing revealed no abnormal findings at 4 days of age. She was discharged without any complications from hospital. No other neonates presented P. aeruginosa infection in the hospital around the same time as this patient. She was fed expressed breast milk in a bottle. Cleaning of the milk bottle with an appropriate sanitizer such as a hypochlorite-based disinfectant, sufficient rinsing, and drying after each use were not being done at home. She developed fever and failure to thrive at 7 days of age and was admitted to our hospital. On examination, she was febrile with a temperature of 38.2\u00b0C, tachycardiac and tachypneic, lethargic, and showing a bulging fontanelle. Her umbilical cord had already fallen off and she had simple dimple. No external malformations could be observed. On admission, initial investigations revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 29.1 \u00d7 109 cells/L (normal range 3.8\u201310.0 \u00d7 109 cells/L) and C-reactive protein at 23.8 mg/L (normal range <2.0 mg/L). The coagulation screen, liver function tests, and renal function tests were normal. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a markedly increased WBC count (4.7 \u00d7 109 /L), elevated protein level (15.9 g/L), and low glucose (1.6 mmol/L) when compared with an elevated serum glucose level (4.3 mmol/L). A Gram stain of CSF showed no organism on admission. Transfontanellar ultrasound performed on the admission day revealed no abnormal findings. Empirical therapy for neonatal meningitis with intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime combined with acyclovir was initiated. On the next day, a CSF culture was positive for P. aeruginosa, and no pathogens were isolated by blood culture and urine culture. We stopped the empiric therapy regimen and started meropenem monotherapy. Once antimicrobial susceptibility test () was confirmed, meropenem de-escalated to cefepime according to the Practical Guideline for Bacterial Meningitis 2014 in Japan. She developed agitation and myoclonus over the 3 days of cefepim treatment. We changed the antibiotic therapy to ceftazidime and continued for 3 weeks. We performed head MRI and whole body enhanced CT scans 12 days after admission. These images showed no findings of ventriculitis, hydrocephalus, brain abscess, or infarction. Structural defects of the cribriform plate, inner ear, or sinuses were also not detected. Her immunological status was assessed, and we found that the total absolute lymphocyte count, immunoglobulin levels, total complement measurement, lymphocyte analysis by flow cytometry, isohemagglutinins, response against lipopolysaccharide, and ability to produce reactive oxygen were all normal, except for slightly low immunoglobulin A level and natural killer cell count. Her clinical course was good, and she was discharged without any complications apart from a slight hearing disability for both ears detected on audiology testing. A brief summary has been shown in the timeline (shown in ). At the time of writing, 8 months after diagnosis, the patient is receiving outpatient follow-up without any problems. We investigated mother's breast skin, feeding bottle, breast pump milk collection kits, and related items as the source of infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from a cleaning sponge brush and had the same band pattern as the isolate obtained from CSF culture as shown by agarose gel electrophoresis patterns of the PCR-based open reading frame typing (POT) (shown in ).\nThe study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Japanese Red Cross Wakayama Medical Center (no. 855).

    "question": "A 67-year-old woman, 55 kg was admitted to hospital with a 3-day history of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She was diagnosed to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 5 years ago and had four episodes of prior hospitalization secondary to acute exacerbation. She often required nebulisers and had an exercise tolerance of approximately 100 yards. In the week prior to admission she had received oral antibiotics and steroids for an infective exacerbation of COPD. On admission to the hospital she had signs of peritonitis and her abdomen was noted to be markedly distended. Ultrasonographic scan revealed a possible bowel (duodenal) perforation. She was tachypneic (RR 28/min) with evidence of accessory muscle use. Examination revealed reduced bi-basal air entry with crepitations all over the chest and chest X-ray showed consolidation of the right middle and lower lobe. Her arterial blood gas revealed type I respiratory failure (FiO2 0.60, pH 7.37, pO258 mmHg, pCO245 mmHg). Her heart rate was 112/min, and BP 90/60 mmHg. She was anemic with hemoglobin of 6 g%. S. urea - 102 and S. creatinine-2 g%. Intravenous acetaminophen was administered for pain relief, but despite this she could not cough or take deep inspiration due to ongoing pain. She was categorized as American society of anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status grade IV/E and was planned for emergency laparotomy. We planned to avoid general, epidural or spinal anesthesia, so we opted for TAP block under ultrasound guidance as a sole anesthetic technique. After proper explanation to the patient about the technique of TAP block, she was taken to operation theatre table and monitors attached. Pulse oximetry showed oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Hence oxygen supplementation was carried out with venturi mask with oxygen flow at 6 L/min. Saturation improved to 92%. After securing an IV access with 18G (Gauge) needle on the right dorsum of the hand, she was sedated with intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion at 4 mcg/kg/min to make her comfortable, cooperative, and pain free for performing the block. Then she was laid supine with the anterolateral abdominal wall exposed bilaterally from the iliac crest to the sub-costal margins and scrubbed aseptically. The block was performed using an aseptic ultrasound guided in-plane technique (s-nerve sonosite, HFL38 (Company brand name of the 6.0 to 13.0 MHz linear probe) probe, 100 mm sonoplex needle). When the needle tip position is within the TAP neuro-fascial plane a mixture of 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine, 20 ml of 1% Lidocaine and 0.2 mg adrenaline was injected slowly through the needle. The same steps were repeated on the contra-lateral side. A remarkably good clinical effect was achieved within 30 min with almost complete resolution of pain. After 30 min, the abdominal incision was carried out without pain. All the vital signs remained normal intraoperatively. Effective coughing and deep breathing became possible and her tachypnea gradually resolved. Laparotomy revealed an ileal perforation, which was sealed with omentum. She made a slow post-operative recovery to be discharged from hospital 14 days after admission. Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",

    "question": "A 7-days-old female newborn was requested to visit our hospital due to an abnormal Pompe disease screening result []. She was born at full-term to a G1P1 mother with a birth bodyweight of 4380 gm. The parents denied poor feeding, poor activity, nor weak crying in this baby. NBS included Pompe disease, and other conditions were performed on her third day of life. On Day 4, our NBS laboratory received her sample. On Day 6, a high risk of Pompe disease was reported (GAA activity 0.18 uM/h (critical cutoff < 0.5); ratio 42.87 (critical cutoff acid \u03b2-glucosidase (ABG)/GAA \u2265 20) so an urgent visit to our hospital was arranged on Day 7. When we saw her, she had normal muscle power, normal reflex, no macroglossia, but her facial folds decrease slightly. Laboratory examination revealed an elevation of pro-BNP (8738 pg/mL), CK (722 U/L), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (112 U/L). A chest X-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly (). Echocardiography revealed moderate left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) hypertrophy, with a LV mass index (LVMI, measured by 2-D method) of 115.7 g/m2 (normal range < 65 g/m2). A whole blood sampling at Day 7 revealed deficient lymphocyte GAA activity (1.33 nmol/g pro/h, normal mean 66.7) and thus confirmed the diagnosis of IOPD. However, she did not have the common CRIM-positive Taiwan Pompe disease p.D645E variant, tested using DNA extracted from the first DBS. Although her CRIM status was unknown, her parents refused prophylactic immune modulation therapy. Western Blot analysis using the white blood cells as the material soon revealed the 110 kDa precursor GAA band (), suggesting a CRIM-positive status. She received her first dose of rhGAA (20 mg/kg) at the age of 8 days. Mutation analysis showed heterozygous c.2024_2026del (p.N675del) and c.2040+1G>T variants in trans, compatible with IOPD. There were no CRIM status predictions about these two variants [].\nThe study was approved by the ethical committee of National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan (201906053RINB, 1st approved date 2019/08/05).

    "question": "The patient is a six-year-old male, the third child in the family with a positive history of a first-degree consanguinity. The other two siblings are completely healthy and there is no family history of genetic disease. The mother is healthy and became pregnant at age 23. There were no complications during the pregnancy. She was positive for group B streptococcus and was adequately treated with antibiotics. The child is a product of full-term pregnancy, delivered through emergent cesarean section due to meconium-stained amniotic fluid and fetal distress. His Apgar score was nine at one minute and nine at five minutes. 3.1 kg (25th percentile), 49 cm (25th percentile), and 34 cm (25th percentile) are the weight, length, and head circumference measurements at birth, respectively. On initial examination, it showed dysmorphic features like deep-seated eyes, small palpebral fissure, low set of ears, high arched palate, short neck, and right-hand polydactyly. The patient was hypertonic on all four limbs. At 12 hours of life, precordial examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border. On pulmonary auscultation, he was ventilated on Assist-Control mode with equal bilateral air entry and no pathological sounds. Abdominal examination revealed umbilical hernia which resolved at seven months of age without any intervention, and normal male genitalia with both testicles present in the scrotum. Chromosomal analysis performed on a cultured peripheral blood sample revealed a mosaic result. Five cells showed an additional chromosome 13 (47, XY, +13). Another five cells showed numerical and structural normal male chromosomes (46, XY).\nThe patient stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a month because of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, pericardial effusion, and respiratory distress. He was treated with polycose and diazoxide, and the goal was to maintain blood glucose level as 5-6 mmol/L. The pericardial effusion resolved on its own and did not need pericardiocentesis. Intubation was performed for respiratory distress because of worsening oxygen saturation. During his stay in the NICU, he was followed up by endocrinology and cardiology. Head and abdominal ultrasounds were normal and chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram showed patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus, both closed by themselves. Patent ductus arteriosus closed few days after birth and the patent foramen ovale closed at the age of nine months. MRI of the brain done on the 12th day of life showed no evidence of structural malformation and no masses or collections. At 15 months of age, he was referred to plastic surgery for removal of the postaxial polydactyly in the right hand.\nThe patient is currently being followed by a pediatrician for his asthma which is under control. At the age of 12 months, he presented to the emergency room (ER) for bronchopneumonia with hyperactive airway disease exacerbation. His hyperactive airway disease was controlled since. He is on salbutamol, taken as needed, and fluticasone 50 mcg twice daily with no day or night symptoms, no exercise-induced symptoms, and no ER visits. He used to follow with endocrinology for transient congenital hyperinsulinemia and he was on diazoxide. It resolved at the age of 18 months. Currently, he is being followed by otolaryngology because of snoring. Prescribed mometasone with the possibility of surgical removal of adenoid hypertrophy if not improved with medication.\nAt the age of two months, he was active, moving all four limbs, mildly holding his head. At age of seven months he was able to sit by himself. At 12 months he was able to cruise around furniture, holds a bottle, and say mama and dada. He was referred to physiotherapy because of balance issues when standing and walking, he showed poor knee control with partial flexion and bowing. According to the mother, his balance issues improved with physiotherapy sessions. At 15 months, he was able to get objects from the floor while standing without losing control and walk a long distance with no support. At 25 months, he was able to say multiple words but unable to form a sentence, he could run and climb up and down the stairs with on and off-balance issues. At four years and five months, he began care with developmental pediatric clinic. They have noticed that his motor activity improved with physical therapy, and he still used single words and no phrases, did not know body parts, was good with non-verbal expression, responds to name, and follows commands. He was noted to be a risk-taker with no sense of danger. The developmental pediatrician assessed his speech and motor skills to be at the level of a two-year-old child. At the age of six years, he continued to make slow progress and he gained new skills like using two to three words phrases and knows some colors and numbers. He is still not trained to use the toilet. The parents were advised to enrol their son in different special education centers to help with his developmental delay.

    "question": "A 23 year old male, first time donor, software engineer, weighing 56 kg with no abnormal medical history or physical examination findings came for voluntary blood donation at the blood donation drive near his office. He had adequate sleep, had taken meal 2 hour back and did not appear unduly anxious. A volume of 350 ml of whole blood was collected from him without any immediate adverse events. He was observed for 15 min postdonation. Following postdonation refreshment and proper postdonation instructions, the donor left the donation premises. Forty minutes later, he had an episode of the loss of consciousness (LOC) and fell on the road and injured himself. LOC lasted for nearly 2 min and was not associated with convulsion or incontinence. He was immediately attended to by blood collection team who were still present at the donation site.\nOn examination, the donor was conscious but confused. He was found to have a lacerated wound (3 cm \u00d7 1 cm) on the lower surface of the chin, fracture teeth, active bleeding from the mouth, tender swelling over the left tempero-mandibular joint area. His pulse rate was 82/min, regular with normal rhythm. The blood pressure was 110/66 mm Hg. Focal neurological deficits were ruled out. On auscultation, air entry into the lungs was bilaterally equal; the abdomen was soft and nontender.\nImmediate management was initiated by maintaining the airway and elevation of the foot end. The donor was reassured. Hemostasis was achieved by compression and wound dressing. The donor with a bystander was immediately shifted to our hospital for further management. The laceration was sutured (See ). Neurosurgery and oro-maxillo-facial surgery consultation were taken. Computed tomography of the head and brain showed fracture neck of the left mandible, fracture left lower incisor, and left lower molar tooth (See Figures -). Fracture mandible was managed conservatively. He was advised restricted jaw movement and liquid diet for 3 weeks. Suture removal was done after 7 days. The donor was regularly followed up by the blood center to ensure his health status. The donor recovered from the injury with full medical support from the Department of Transfusion Medicine. Reaction and outcome were reported to the Hemovigilance Programme of India. Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",

    "question": "A 34-year-old secundigravida, underwent fetal MRI at 30 weeks\u2019 gestation confirming bilateral hydronephrosis, right dysplastic kidney, megacystis, and oligohydramnios. A male neonate, weighing 2.650 g, was delivered by elective C-section at 36 weeks\u2019 gestation. Immediately after birth, he developed a mild pneumothorax with respiratory distress requiring nasal CPAP. Initial serum creatinine was 1.6 mg/dl. An initial attempt at transurethral catheterization using a 6 Fr Foley catheter was unsuccessful due to excessive resistance felt halfway through the urethra, and was followed by a self-limiting urethral bleeding. A 5 Fr umbilical catheter was therefore used to drain the bladder. Postnatal ultrasonography confirmed an enlarged and thick-walled bladder, associated with mild bilateral hydronephrosis, a dysplastic right kidney, and multiple small cysts with cortical subcapsular distribution in the contralateral left kidney. The umbilical catheter slipped out of the bladder after 72 h and was eventually replaced with a 6 Fr Foley catheter. On day-of-life 14, he was deemed fit enough to undergo VCUG. The test revealed a trabeculated bladder associated with a moderate posterior urethral dilatation and left-sided grade III vesicoureteral reflux. After catheter withdrawal, a good urinary stream and complete bladder emptying were documented during micturition (). The baby was ultimately discharge home on day-of-life 17, with a relatively stable renal function. Repeat VCUG at 9 months disclosed a less irregular bladder contour, gradual shrinking of the posterior urethral dilatation, and reflux disappearance. The bladder emptied rapidly, and postvoid residual urine volume was small. He is now 2 years old and, following a first episode of urinary tract infection, had undergone second look cystoscopy that ruled out obstructing residual valves. Follow-up ultrasonography showed progressive thinning of the bladder wall and minimal postvoid residual urine volume ().\nRenal function remains stable with a serum creatinine of 0.53 mg/dl. However, eGFR (59 mL/min/1.73m2) falls within the range of stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",

    "question": "A 6-month-old male infant, 3.5 kg in weight, presented with the history of refusal to feed, tender abdomen, swelling in the right groin and constipation since 3 days. Diagnosis of a right-sided obstructed, irreducible indirect inguinal hernia was made. The paediatric surgeons reduced the hernia and a semi-elective herniotomy was planned.\nThe child had a history of stridorous breathing since birth and was subsequently diagnosed as a case of congenital laryngomalacia. He was a full-term delivery by Caesarean section for meconium-stained liquor. The infant was kept in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 3 days post-delivery for breathing difficulties and neonatal jaundice. Anaesthesia pre-evaluation revealed microretrognathia []. The child underwent a High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging of the chest along with virtual bronchoscopy to rule out any obstruction in the airway and there was a chance finding of three ununited rib fractures of the left side (4th, 5thand 6th) []. Subsequent paediatric, orthopaedic and ophthalmologic evaluations revealed blue sclera, spontaneous rib fractures, failure to thrive and multiple hernias (umbilical and right inguinal) because of the lax abdominal wall. Cardiac evaluation was unremarkable. A clinical diagnosis of congenital osteogenesis imperfecta type 1 was made by the paediatricians.\nHigh-risk consent and consent for post-operative ventilation was obtained. The child was premedicated with inj. glycopyrolate 4 mcg/kg, inj. midazolam 0.03 mg/kg and inj. ketamine 0.5 mg/kg IV. Anaesthesia was induced with IV propofol 2 mg/kg. A paediatric fibreoptic bronchoscope was not available, so direct laryngoscopy was performed with a shoulder pad in place and intubation was achieved in the second attempt using size 1 Miller blade, and a 3.5-mm uncuffed enotracheal tube (ETT) was inserted. On direct laryngoscopy, the view was Cormack-Lehane Grade III. After confirmation of tube placement, inj. atracurium 0.5 mg/kg was administered and anaesthesia was maintained with oxygen, nitrous oxide, and sevoflurane. Monitoring devices included a pulse oximeter, cardioscope, non-invasive blood pressure monitor, temperature monitor and capnometer. Caudal block was administered with 2 cc of 0.25% bupivacaine. The patient was carefully repositioned supine and adequate padding was done. The surgery lasted 30 min and was uneventful. Post-surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed and the patient extubated. The patient was shifted to the ICU for observation. A quiet and pain-free post-operative period ensured that the patient did not have any breathing difficulties.

    "question": "A 30-year-old previously well Bangladeshi male was admitted to a local tertiary care hospital with a 20-day history of fever, chills, rigors, headache, myalgias, and anorexia. He had been suffering from nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, jaundice with scleral icterus and dark urine for five days. One day prior to admission, he was diagnosed with malaria on thick smear at a private hospital, however parasite density result was unavailable. There he was treated with intravenous quinine (750 mg 8-hourly x five doses) and azithromycin, due to limited availability of first line therapy of artesunate, before being referred for further management.\nPast medical history was significant for three prior malaria infections. His most recent episode of suspected vivax malaria was 30 days prior to admission, which was partially treated with an incomplete course of chloroquine. He had no history of jaundice, liver disease, transfusions, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. There was no family history of jaundice or iron treatments. He did not take any regular or traditional medicines. There was no history of betel nut consumption.\nOn admission, he had a temperature of 39.7 oC, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 15/15, blood pressure (BP) 127/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 127 beats per minute, a respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 93 % on room air, and body weight of 65 kg. He appeared unwell with pronounced scleral icterus, black urine, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly (4 cm and 5 cm below the costal margin, respectively). There was no conjunctival suffusion or lymphadenopathy.\nAdmission peripheral blood smear confirmed a diagnosis of falciparum malaria (360 parasites/\u03bcl). Severity criteria included hyperlactataemia (lactate 6.8 mmol/L), hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin 58 \u03bcmol/L), and 4+ haemoglobinuria (blackwater fever); hence the case was classified as severe malaria (Table ). He was promptly treated with intravenous artesunate 120 mg, 2.4 mg/kg body weight (Guilin Pharmaceuticals, China) at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h (four doses), in addition to empiric ceftriaxone 2,000 mg every 12 h, as per local hospital practice. After 30 h his peripheral parasites cleared with resolution of the fever and haemoglobinuria, and he was switched to oral artemether/lumefantrine (AL) combination 80/480 mg (Novartis, Switzerland).\nOn the third day of admission he developed fever, confusion, dyspnoea (RR 28, SaO2 90 %), tachycardia (HR 106), hypotension (BP 100/80 mmHg), recurrent 4+ haemoglobinuria with severe microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin of 32 g/L) accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin, consistent with acute haemolytic anaemia (Table , Fig. ). Pre-transfusion peripheral blood smear showed no schistocytes and reticulocytes of 2 % (reticulocyte production index 0.15 (compared to RPI of 0.3 on day 3 in blackwater fever patients []). Direct antiglobulin test (DAT; anti-IgG and anti-C3d) was negative and indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) was positive. Glucose was normal. Blood and urine bacterial cultures were negative. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing and haemoglobin typing were not available. Human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology were negative. Hepatitis B antigen was negative. He promptly received transfusion of three units matched whole blood. Intravenous artesunate was substituted for AL despite parasite clearance due to the notion that the recurrent fever must be due to malaria. In total, he received seven doses of artesunate (total dose of 840 mg) and three doses of AL (total dose of artemether 240 mg, and lumefantrine 1,440 mg). Empiric amikacin 500 mg, 7.5 mg/kg 8-hourly was added on day 6 to broaden antibacterial coverage for potential multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria given his ongoing fever despite negative blood and urine cultures. The haemolysis continued for nine days and he required a total of 10 transfusions (Fig. ).\nOn day 10, bone marrow biopsy revealed gross hypercellularity with erythroid hyperplasia and no evidence of lymphoma, leukaemia, or haemophagocytic syndrome. Meropenem (500 mg 8-hourly) was empirically substituted for amikacin and ceftriaxone given his renal dysfunction to cover potential extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producers, and dexamethasone 5 mg 6-hourly was initiated for suspected autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. The haemoglobinuria resolved two days after steroid treatment and ceftriaxone discontinuation. His haemoglobin slowly recovered, reaching 76 g/L by day 20.\nOn day 16, he had ongoing fever with right-sided facial pain and swelling. A large, 3 \u00d7 2 cm ulcer on the right upper hard palate covered with yellow slough and an area of necrosis was observed (Fig. ). The right maxillary sinus was tender on palpation. He had pain with right eye extra-ocular movements but no ocular discharge, proptosis, pupil asymmetry, diplopia, or decreased visual acuity. There was no nasal or ear involvement. A swab of the hard palate ulceration revealed long, broad, aseptate hyphal elements displaying 90\u00b0 branching consistent with Mucor, (Fig. ). Fungal cultures failed to grow. MRI showed extensive right-sided opacification and mucosal thickening of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses with no radiographic evidence of orbital or cerebral extension (Fig. ). He underwent prompt surgical debridement of the oral ulcer and right maxillary sinus. His steroids were discontinued and he was started on oral itraconazole 100 mg 12-hourly until first line treatment with amphotericin B became available nine days later. Intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate 50 mg daily, was continued for 14 days with improvement of his facial swelling and oral ulceration. The patient was pleased with his clinical improvement and hospital care, however due to a family emergency in his remote village he left hospital against medical advice and could not attend follow up.

    "question": "A 78-year-old man presented with 1-day history of nausea and vomiting. His symptoms started suddenly the night prior to presentation. The nausea was constant, to the point where he could no longer tolerate oral intake. Vomiting occurred 5 to 6 times throughout the evening, but there were no further episodes as of the morning of presentation. He endorsed very minimal epigastric burning, which he described as a \u201cgas pain,\u201d but he had no other abdominal symptoms. His bowel movements were normal. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days prior; during that hospitalization, he had symptomatic bradycardia felt to be secondary to his \u03b2-blocker. His dosage was reduced, his bradycardia improved, and he was discharged home. Since discharge, he noted persistent exertional dyspnea and bilateral lower extremity edema.\nThe past medical history was remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, nonischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction of approximately 40%) with stage III diastolic dysfunction, and chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 2.2). He smoked 4 cigarettes daily for 25 years, but not the last 20 years. His medications included aspirin, simvastatin, furosemide, metoprolol tartrate, and glipizide.\nOn examination, his blood pressure was 136/71 mmHg, heart rate 77 bpm, respiratory rate 16, temperature 36.1\u00b0C, oxygen saturation 100% (room air), weight 82 kg, and no orthostasis. In general, he was not in acute distress. There were no skin lesions. Mucous membranes were moist. Lung fields were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart was regular without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. He had jugular venous distention 4 cm above the sternal angle. His abdomen was benign. He had no tenderness over his liver and no hepatomegaly was present. He had minimal bilateral lower extremity edema.\nThe patient\u2019s white blood cell count was 15 200/mm3. The hemoglobin was 13 g/dL, and the platelet count was 97 000/mm3. The total bilirubin was 3.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 1.3 \u00b5g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 4725 IU/L (normal value = 12-38 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 3240 IU/L (normal value = 10-45 IU/L), alkaline phosphatase 110 IU/L (normal value = 25-100 IU/L), total protein 6.6 g/dL, and albumin 3.7 g/dL. The international normalized ratio (INR) was 2.6. His sodium was 134 mmol/L, potassium 5.6 mmol/L, bicarbonate 21 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 54 mg/dL, and creatinine 3.5 mg/dL. His brain-natriuretic peptide was 1040 pg/mL (normal = <100 pg/mL), and troponin was 0.50 ng/mL (normal = <0.09 mg/mL). His lipase was 49.0 IU/L (normal = 10-50 IU/L).\nAn abdominal ultrasound revealed increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma, patent hepatic vasculature, and no dilated intrahepatic or extrahepatic ducts. The acetaminophen level was zero and the urine drug screen negative. Hepatitis A to C serologies were negative, and antinuclear antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, F-actin antibody, and liver-kidney microsome-1 antibody titers were all normal. Further review of his past records indicated that his liver tests were AST 47 IU/L and ALT 53 IU/L during his hospitalization 10 days ago.\nThe patient\u2019s electrocardiogram (ECG; ) revealed multiple conduction defects including a right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and a first-degree atrioventricular block. He also had inferior Q waves and T wave inversions in leads I, aVL, and V3. These findings along with the conduction defects were all seen on previous ECGs. Review of prior records indicated that he had a left heart catheterization about 18 months prior to this admission. At that time was found to have nonobstructive coronary disease.\nHis most recent echocardiogram (), which was performed 2 weeks prior to this admission, showed a reduced ejection fraction (40%), biatrial enlargement (, RA and LA), and biventricular hypertrophy (, VS and PW; , arrows). There was also a granular or \u201cspeckled\u201d appearance of the myocardium (, asterisk). The estimated peak right ventricular systolic pressure was 34 mm Hg based on an estimated right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg, without primary valvular abnormalities. Mitral valve inflow Doppler and mitral annulus tissue Doppler () were consistent with severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The E/e ratio was >15, consistent with an elevated left ventricular filling pressure. There was hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior and septal walls.\nThe patient was monitored overnight and his symptoms resolved without intervention. His blood pressure remained within normal limits and he had normal urine output. The aminotransferases declined dramatically, to a level of 1070 IU/L within 48 hours. He was discharged home in baseline condition. One month later, he was seen in cardiology clinic during which time he had further evaluation with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; ). This revealed diffuse myocardial thickening of both left and right ventricles with delayed hyperenhancement in a pattern consistent with amyloidosis ( and , asterisks). Both atria were dilated in size, with evidence of patchy subendocardial scar ( and , arrows). The patient declined endomyocardial biopsy and further invasive investigation or therapy.

    "question": "A 4.5-month-old female presented to hospital with a 2-day history of watery diarrhea and fever developed in the 12 hours before admission. The infant was reported to have had 10 watery stools over the previous 24 hours, during which she became quite unsettled, crying a lot, whilst drinking half her usual amount of liquids. There was no history of vomiting.\nHer medical history revealed delivery at term via emergency cesarean section due to severe fetal distress, with a birth weight of 2910 g. Her Apgar score was 0-1 at one and five minutes, respectively, after delivery requiring tracheal intubation and transfer into neonatal intensive care unit. She was put into induced coma and active hypothermia for 72 hours. The infant was extubated on the fourth day of life, followed by reestablishment of enteral nutrition by day 5. She was fed exclusively on formula milk from birth. An MRI performed on day 5 showed signs of severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Followup after discharge was very irregular and the infant did not receive any vaccines up until the current hospitalization episode. Her weight curve was a reason for concern; indeed, her weight two weeks before the current admission to hospital was 4390 g.\nOn the day of presentation, physical examination revealed an alert but irritable and ill-appearing infant with a temperature of 39.9\u00b0C, heart rate between 170 and 190 beats/min, respiratory rate between 40 and 80 breaths/min, blood pressure of 102/55 mmHg, and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 100%. The child's weight at admission into hospital was 3990 g, meaning she lost 10% of the previous reported weight. The skin was pale grey, tenting skin turgor, dry lips and dry buccal mucosa, normal looking eyes but reduced tears, soft fontanele, and capillary refill time of 3 seconds. The urine output was also decreased. Heart and lung examination were normal except for tachycardia; the abdomen was swollen and slightly painful on palpation, no hepatosplenomegaly. Abdominal and thorax radiographs were normal. There were no signs of meningeal irritation. Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL, white blood cells 11 970/mm3 (PMN = 7590), platelets 1 085 000/mm3, and C-reactive protein was less than 0.05 mg/dL (). Routine stool specimen tested positive for rotavirus antigen (Vikia Rota-Adeno, Biomerieux), whilst results for blood and urine culture were negative. Serum electrolytes were significant for a sodium concentration of 146 mEq/L and a bicarbonate level of 8 mEq/L. Blood urea nitrogen was 61 mg/dL.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and intravenous fluid therapy was promptly initiated to correct the infant's tachycardia, polypnea, and low blood pH, by attempting volume repletion with 2 subsequent doses of 0.9% sodium chloride at 20 mL/kg over 60 minutes. A solution containing dextrose 5% plus electrolytes was administered soon after the second dose of normal saline to attain the slow correction of hypernatremia. Diuresis was reestablished within four hours of rehydration therapy. Digestive losses of water and electrolytes were offset by oral rehydration solution (ORS), at an initial dose of 10 mL/kg and thereafter replaced volume per volume depending on the amount of stool losses. Enterol (yeast of Saccharomyces boulardii) was initiated as an adjuvant treatment to ORS. Metabolic acidosis was difficult to correct during the first 48 hours because of large liquid losses due to diarrhea. Despite the difficulties experienced to restore the electrolytic balance, the baby showed an outstanding digestive tolerance throughout the entire hospital stay, which allowed continuation of enteral nutrition with lactose-free formula milk (Novalac Diarinova).\nAt 24 hours after admission, hyperleukocytosis with neutrophilia and increased C-reactive protein in blood () prompted antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg/day, which was suspended three days later due to negative bacterial culture results; stools were not tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile. Adjuvant treatment with gelatin tannate was initiated on the third day of hospitalization. Metabolic acidosis improved in the following 48 hours along with a substantial reduction in stool output. The baby was exclusively fed by oral route from the fifth day. The patient's history included also antiplatelet treatment (aspirin 5 mg/kg/day for one month) due to thrombocytosis.\nGelatin tannate was first administered in the afternoon of the third day of hospitalization, one sachet every 6 hours, five days after the start of diarrhea. The patient presented to hospital with a 2-day history of 10 watery stools a day, followed by a slight increase in the number of liquid stools during the first 4 days of hospitalization (). A considerable reduction of the total number of daily stools was registered in the first 24 hours after initiating antidiarrheal treatment with gelatin tannate, with four and three watery stools registered in the first 12 and 24 hours, respectively. The number and volume of stools continued to diminish substantially during the second day of treatment, with the diarrhea practically resolving by the third day of treatment with gelatin tannate (only three stools of almost normal consistency). Gelatin tannate was administered-dissolved in ORS, except for the first dose (dissolved in milk). The progress was favorable, however, the patient was discharged from hospital three days later in order to achieve optimum nutrition and to ensure vaccinations were up to date. Upon discharge from hospital the baby's weight was 4.640 kg. Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis received a renal allograft from his mother in 2005 using prednisolone, cyclosporine and azathioprine, without induction therapy. During the immediate post transplant period, he received three intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone 1 g each daily for acute cellular rejection. He did not develop major infections till the current episode. His weight was 58 kg. He had stable graft function, with serum creatinine at 1.6 mg/dl and was on prednisolone 10 mg/d, azathioprine 100 mg/d and cyclosporine 175 mg/d, with the trough (C0) and 2-hour (C2) cyclosporine levels being 368 and 1280 ng/ml, respectively, at 6 months after transplantation.\nThree years after transplantation, he presented to us with 4 months history of fever, weight loss of 16 kg in 4 months, episodic small volume diarrhea and diffuse abdominal pain with occasional hematochezia. He did not have pulmonary or other gastrointestinal symptoms. He discontinued cyclosporine 4 months prior to visiting our center. At presentation, he was on prednisolone (10 mg/d) and azathioprine (100 mg/d). On examination, his weight was 38 kg, and pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate were normal. He was pale but did not have icterus or peripheral lymphadenopathy or allograft tenderness. He had a diffuse, ill-defined, firm, tender mass (9 \u00d7 7 cm) in the right hypochondrium. There was no hepatosplenomegaly or ascites.\nLaboratory investigations revealed anemia (hemoglobin of 6.7 g/dl), a total leukocyte count of 4200/mm3, a normal platelet count and serum albumin of 2.2 g/dl. He had renal allograft dysfunction (serum creatinine of 3.1 mg/dl) with normal electrolyte profile and liver enzymes. His chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined minimal haziness in the right upper and midzones with minimal pleural effusion. Ultrasonogram of abdomen showed an intussusception mass measuring 7.1 \u00d7 5.0 \u00d7 10.1 cm in the right hypochondrium with a few enlarged mesenteric nodes and fat within and adjacent to it []. The renal allograft appeared normal. Computed tomogram (CT) scan of abdomen with rectal contrast revealed an ileocolic intussusception up to the hepatic flexure with multiple enlarged mesenteric nodes and mesenteric fat pulled into it []. The ascending colon was thick. The para-aortic, mesenteric and para-iliac nodes were enlarged and showed central necrosis.\nThe patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy with resection of the ileocolic intussusception, the adjacent ascending colon and terminal ileum []. Histopathological examination of the ileocolic intussusception revealed fragments of a lymph node with extensive caseation necrosis and many acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The proximal polypoidal lesion of the intussusceptum and the mucosal ulcerations of the intussuscepient colonic segment revealed dense inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells, along with microabscesses in the submucosa and lamina propria, transmural granulomas with epitheloid histiocytes, lymphocytes; Langhans type multinucleated giant cells and central foci of caseation [Figure and ]. Long, curved and beaded AFB, morphologically typical of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), were detected in all the above-mentioned lesions [].\nOn the first postoperative day, the patient received hydrocortisone 100 mg thrice daily, but azathioprine was discontinued due to leukopenia (WBC count 1900/mm3). He received granulocyte colony stimulating factor for leukopenia. On the second postoperative day, he was weaned off mechanical ventilation. On the fourth postoperative day, he received ATT with isoniazid 300 mg/d, rifampicin 450 mg/d, pyrazinamide 750 mg/d and ethambutol 400 mg/d. On the fifth postoperative day, 36 hours after starting ATT, he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, oliguria and worsening of pulmonary oxygenation [partial pressure to inspired fraction of oxygen ratio (P\u2013F ratio)]. The chest radiograph revealed worsening of the preexisting haziness. However, there was no bacteremia or evidence of invasive fungal infection.The total leukocyte count had remained about 4500 cells/mm3 during this period. His condition subsequently worsened, and he received broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin with tazobactam) while routine cultures remained sterile. A tracheal aspirate showed numerous AFB morphologically typical of MTB, though there was no growth in culture. In addition, tracheal aspirate grew mixture of non-fermenting gram negative bacilli and Candida glabrata, which were probably contaminants. He continued to develop worsening features of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, lung infiltrates, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Steroids were continued, antibiotics were changed empirically to meropenem with teicoplanin and liposomal amphotericin B. The patient died on the 11th postoperative day. The next of kin declined post-mortem examination. Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",

    "question": "A 68-year-old man (165 cm, 74 kg) was scheduled for transurethral resection of a bladder tumor using 5-ALA. He had been receiving amlodipine 5 mg and azilsartan 20 mg every morning orally for hypertension. His blood pressure was maintained around 130/70 mmHg. Since he had been diagnosed with pyogenic spondylodiscitis in the fourth/fifth lumber disk region in his forties, general anesthesia was preferred. During the pre-operative examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and laboratory test findings were normal.\nThe patient took only amlodipine besylate on the morning of the surgery. Three hours before anesthesia induction, 5-ALA 20 mg/kg (Alaglio, Chugai Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) was administrated orally. Just before anesthesia induction, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was 98/61 mmHg and his heart rate 82 beats/min. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 100 mg, rocuronium 50 mg, fentanyl 100 \u03bcg, and remifentanil 0.4 \u03bcg/kg/min. After 5 min, just before tracheal intubation, his blood pressure decreased to 47/32 mmHg. There were no observed changes in his electrocardiogram, such as ST-T changes or arrhythmia. Although we used phenylephrine at a total dose of 0.2 mg and ephedrine at a total dose of 10 mg over 10 min, hypotension persisted at 50/33 mmHg. Wheezing and erythema were not observed. Administration of 100 mL hydroxyethyl starch bolus for a few minutes was unsuccessful in increasing blood pressure. Transthoracic cardiac ultrasonography revealed normal systolic function, no asynergy, and normal size of the inferior vena cava. Bolus administration of noradrenaline at a total dose of 30 \u03bcg over 6 min slightly increased blood pressure to 65/39 mmHg. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed the following: pH, 7.350; HCO3\u2212 concentration, 23.2 mmol/L; base excess, 2.3 mmol/L; and lactate concentration, 1.7 mmol/L. Following this, bolus administration of adrenaline at a total dose of 30 \u03bcg over 9 min elevated the blood pressure from 53/26 to 127/49 mmHg. We decided to perform surgery under continuous administration of adrenaline. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The patient\u2019s blood pressure and heart rate ranged from 72/31 to 94/40 mmHg and from 70 to 85 beats/min, respectively, under the administration of adrenaline at 0.01\u20130.07 \u03bcg/kg/min. On completion of the surgery, he was transferred to the intensive care unit under intubation. Twelve minutes after admission to the intensive care unit, he was extubated as his blood pressure had stabilized at 142/56 mmHg under the administration of adrenaline at 0.03 \u03bcg/kg/min. Ten minutes after extubation, adrenaline infusion was discontinued. Although his lactate concentration was 5.3 mmol/L at this time, it decreased to 2.7 mmol/L after 3 h. His blood pressure and heart rate were stable during his intensive care unit stay. The patient was then transferred to the general ward on day 1 postoperatively. He was discharged without any complications 6 days postoperatively. Three months later, dermatologists performed a skin-prick test on him for propofol, rocuronium, and 5-ALA, the results of which were negative. Five months later, he received TUR-Bt under general anesthesia without 5-ALA for recurrence of tumor. Although we used propofol and rocuronium, severe hypotension did not occur.

    "question": "A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with progressive dyspnea, cough, and cold sweats. He mentioned night sweating for a year and 15 kilograms weight loss. His medical history stated a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection since 2003, with a double-sided pneumonia with Pneumocystis jirovecii (among other pathogens) at admittance, therefore diagnosed as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patient was treated with antiretroviral therapy with an undetectable viral load in 2012, but had stopped taking medication 1 year ago. He lived in a homeless shelter with his wife (who was also HIV positive); his children were accommodated elsewhere. There was no (intravenous) drug or alcohol use, and he had quit smoking 15 years ago. Physical examination on admission showed a non-acutely ill patient, tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. His blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate 132 per minute, and temperature 38.2\u00b0C. Percussion of the lungs did not reveal any dullness, and at auscultation normal breath sounds were heard except for the left lower side. Other physical examination was unremarkable.\nRelevant laboratory results on admission were hemoglobin 7.2 mmol/L, white blood cell count 6.6 \u00d7 109/L, platelets 214 \u00d7 109/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 64 mg/L. There was no renal or hepatic insufficiency. Immunology results were as follows: CD4: 0.039 \u00d7 109/L, CD8: 1.2 \u00d7 109/L, CD4/CD8 ratio: 0.033. A chest X-ray showed bilateral \u201ccloudy\u201d infiltrates.\nThe patient was treated according to the local sepsis protocol, with gentamicin 280 mg and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1200 mg intravenously in the emergency room. This was followed by cotrimoxazole (3 \u00d7 1920 mg) and prednisolone (2 \u00d7 40 mg) the next day for suspected PJP. Two days after admission, a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Directly after this procedure, the patient became dyspneic, had low oxygen saturations (82%), and developed subcutaneous emphysema. Due to progressive respiratory insufficiency, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were necessary. Bronchoscopy-guided intubation was performed in the operating theater, which was uneventful. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest immediately after intubation showed subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema without pneumothorax. Also, severe air bronchograms and bilateral infiltrations were seen. Patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) afterward.\nDuring the (ventilatory) treatment on the ICU, the subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema increased, resulting in swelling of the entire face, arms, and torso down to the scrotum (). Several bronchoscopies were performed to exclude tracheal injury that could have occurred during the BAL, but no injury was visualized. Despite efforts to treat patient with lung protective ventilation, using low tidal volumes and low airway pressures, the emphysema continued to increase. A new CT scan was performed 1 week after admission to the ICU, showing severe subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema (). Treatment of the emphysema by skin incisions alone (\u201cblow holes\u201d) was considered but discarded due to the high HIV viral load (700,000 copies/mL) of the patient and the fear of viral spreading by blood spatters. Because of the severity and increase of the symptoms and no obvious tracheal injury (on subsequent bronchoscopies and CT scans), a search for other treatment options was performed. After elaborate consideration, it was decided to make two infraclavicular skin incisions and place VAC therapy on these incisions (ActiV.A.C., KCI Medical, \u2013125 mm Hg; ). While the subcutaneous emphysema started to improve significantly, a gradual clinical improvement was seen in the first week. VAC therapy was ended 9 days after initiation. The subcutaneous emphysema continued to decrease after removal of the VAC therapy system.\nDuring his stay on the ICU, inflammatory markers decreased together with the pulmonary infiltrations on the chest X-ray, implying adequate treatment of the PJP. Patient was extubated after 17 days of mechanical ventilation, with a significant ICU-acquired weakness. Furthermore, dysphonia was reported, possibly caused by emphysema of the larynx. The patient was discharged to the general ward 25 days after admission to the ICU. Antiretroviral medicine was restarted, and patient was finally discharged to a medical rehabilitation center for further recovery.

    "question": "An 18-year-old Brazilian man developed dyspnea and fever of one week\u2019s duration and was then diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia. Before this incident, he had not experienced any medical complications, lived in full sanitary conditions, denied previous symptoms related to disease, did not have any pets, and denied eating raw meat. He then began hospital inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics, and third-generation cephalosporin (Ceftriaxone) and a macrolide (Clarithromycin) were prescribed for 8 days. Laboratory tests from the patient\u2019s admittance showed mild anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.7 g/dL, with normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). Other biochemical results were as follows: creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, urea 32 mg/dL, total bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, glucose 90 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 3.7 mEq/L, and C-reactive protein 138.2 mg/L. Leucocytes levels were a little low, with 2700 cells/\u03bcL. Blood and urine cultures were negative for infection and serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, and syphilis were all negative.\nOn the fourth day of this related treatment, our patient developed abdominal distension and pain in his lower right abdominal quadrant. Acute appendicitis was confirmed by ultrasound examination, and he underwent laparoscopic surgery the same day. Our patient was then taken to our intensive care unit for worsening of his clinical condition. On the fourth postoperative day, our patient developed fever associated with right pleural effusion, which was a lymphocytic exudate with an adenosine deaminase concentration of 17.99 U/L and negative culture (Fig. ). Thus, the attending physicians requested a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy. The transbronchial fluid had negative cultures for infection. At that time, the antibiotic spectrum was extended for treatment of the sepsis, including piperacillin/tazobactam for 10 days.\nAnatomopathological examination of the transbronchial biopsy specimen showed a small fragment of lung parenchyma with discrete septal thickening and a rounded structure suggestive of a pseudocyst containing Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoites (Fig. ).\nOur patient showed progressive improvement after antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, and was discharged on the 14th day after surgery. A chest radiograph showed significant improvement in lung opacification (Fig. ) and serological tests for toxoplasmosis were negative for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M.\nOur patient was followed up on an outpatient basis for 2 years without any signs of recurrence of lung infections or other comorbidities. Serology for toxoplasmosis were repeated and remained negative. What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 43 year-old male was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital after his workplace colleagues noted increasingly strange behavior for three days. The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient\u2019s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.\nThough initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.\nIn the ED, the patient\u2019s temperature was 103.9\u00b0F (39.9\u00b0C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.\nInitial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0\u201310.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0\u201318.0], platelet count of 135 \u00d7 103/mm3 [lab range 150\u2013350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137\u2013145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98\u2013107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0\u201330.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9\u201320], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7\u20131.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70\u201399], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0\u201310]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0\u20130.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38\u2013126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13\u201369), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15\u201346). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5\u201310 WBC, 0\u20135 red blood cells (RBC), 5\u201310 epithelial cells, 5\u201310 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40\u201370], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12\u201360], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient\u2019s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient\u2019s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64.

    "question": "A 38-year-old man presented to an emergency department with progressive weakness and decreased urine output after having vomited up to 20 times per day over a period of 7 days. The patient was referred to our intensive care unit. Before medical consultation, he was healthy, and no other symptoms were reported. Diarrhea, fever, chills, or abdominal pain was absent.\nClinical examination revealed a patient of normal weight (height: 180 cm, weight: 70 kg). Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated (150/80 mmHg, 105/min); the respiratory rate was normal (13/min), but oxygen saturation was low (89%). During blood pressure measurement, a positive Trousseau sign was noted. The mucous membranes were dry, and the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nArterial blood gas analysis revealed a metabolic alkalosis with partial respiratory compensation (pH: 7.71 [7.35\u20137.45], base excess: 40.5 mmol/l [-2-3 mmol/l], pCO2: 56.1 mmHg [32\u201345 mmHg], pO2: 43.5 mmHg [83\u2013108 mmHg], bicarbonate: 72.2 mmol/l [21\u201326 mmol/l], lactate: 2.8 mmol/l [0.5\u20131.6 mmol/l], chloride: 52 mmol/l [98\u2013106 mmol/l], sodium: 130 mmol/l [136\u2013146 mmol/l], potassium: 2.4 mmol/l [3.5\u20135.1 mmol/l], ionized calcium: 0.77 mmol/l [1.15\u20131.29 mmol/l] and glucose: 165 mg/dl [70\u2013105 mg/dl]).\nUltrasound revealed a distended and full stomach; the inferior vena cava was collapsing on inspiration. Otherwise, the ultrasound was unremarkable. The electrocardiography [] showed a prolonged QT interval (QTc 547 ms).\nLaboratory tests were consistent with acute kidney injury (creatinine: 5.2 mg/dl, urea: 176 mg/dl); liver function tests, coagulation tests, albumin, lipase, procalcitonin, total calcium, hemoglobin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Leukocytes were minimally elevated (11500/\u03bcl).\nWe suspected a prerenal acute kidney injury and a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to gastric losses of HCl and fluids. Initial management consisted of oxygen therapy to correct hypoxemia and intravenous fluid therapy with normal saline and potassium chloride. Initially, a balanced crystalloid solution was infused, and later normal saline with KCl (40 mmol/l) was used because of the higher chloride content. Metoclopramide was administered to promote gastric emptying. To prevent further gastric losses of HCl, a proton-pump inhibitor was given. The patient was put on nihil per os for 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, a total of 4.5 l of crystalloid fluid was infused. There was no further vomiting. A repeated bedside ultrasound revealed an empty stomach. The pH was corrected to 7.49, bicarbonate was reduced to 48.6 mmol/l, base excess was 23.4, chloride was 69 mmol/l, and potassium was still low at 2.8 mmol/l. There was hypoventilation with a pCO2 of 68.4 mmHg. We noted onset of diuresis. After 72 h of fluid therapy, the acid-base and electrolyte status was normal. Creatinine had decreased to 3.5 mg/dl. Small meals were tolerated.\nSince there was no evidence of an infectious etiology for the excessive vomiting and the ultrasound had shown a distended stomach, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed []. A significant stenosis of the duodenum was diagnosed. Although there was no ulcer visible, an occult ulcer was deemed to be possible. A portal hypertensive gastropathy was diagnosed while esophageal varices were absent. Helicobacter pylori testing was positive, so an eradication therapy was initiated. A repeated endoscopy confirmed the stenosis, but again, no ulcer was seen. Since a focused abdominal ultrasound did not reveal the reason for the stenosis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed to rule out malignancy such as pancreatic or gallbladder cancer or a thrombosis of the mesenteric vein. There was no evidence of malignancy or cirrhosis. An endosonography was done without evidence of malignancy or mesenteric vein thrombosis. At that point, the stenosis had partly resolved, and endoscopic passage was possible. We concluded that the temporary duodenal stenosis was caused most likely by portal hypertension of unknown etiology, and our differential diagnosis included idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension after exclusion of cirrhosis and portal vein obstruction.

    "question": "A 69-year-old Hispanic male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to our emergency department (ED) complaining of decreased urine output for two days along with intermittent nausea and vomiting for two weeks. His past medical history included hypertension and coronary artery disease. Three weeks prior to presenting to the ED, our patient had undergone routine lab studies, which had documented normal kidney function with a serum creatinine level (Cr) of 0.97 mg/dL and no microalbuminuria. He had been taking metformin 850 mg three times a day and lisinopril 10 mg per day for more than a year, which he continued to take during his presenting illness. He was not taking any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or other over-the-counter (OTC) medications. On initial evaluation, the patient was alert and oriented and in no distress. He was afebrile with a blood pressure of 152/69 mmHg, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Except for mild abdominal tenderness, his exam was unremarkable.\nInitial laboratory studies in the ED showed severe kidney injury with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 68 mg/dL and Cr of 12.2 mg/dL. Additionally, he was found to have a blood glucose level of 188 mg/dL, sodium level of 137 mmol/L, chloride level of 97 mmol/L, CO2 level of 8 mmol/L, potassium level of 6.2 mmol/L, and WBC count of 10,900 per uL with 83% neutrophils. Arterial blood gas revealed pH of 7.13 and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 21 mmHg. The anion gap (AG) was 32 mmol/L with a delta ratio of 1.3; lactate was 18.1 mmol/L. He had a pure high AG metabolic acidosis with high lactate levels. Renal ultrasound demonstrated kidneys of normal size and normal echogenicity without obstruction. Abdominal/pelvic CT was unremarkable. Supportive measures, including IV antibiotics, fluids, sodium bicarbonate as a drip infusion, and oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate were initiated. Bladder catheterization revealed less than 10 ml of urine. Urine microscopy was significant for brown muddy casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Electrocardiography results were normal.\nHe was transferred to our intensive care unit, where urgent conventional hemodialysis with a blood flow of 250 ml/min was initiated for MALA and oliguric renal failure. Sodium bicarbonate drip infusion was discontinued before the initiation of dialysis. During the initial dialysis, he became hypoxic with a decreased level of consciousness and hemodynamically instability. His mean arterial pressure decreased to 50 mm Hg with a pulse rate of 43 beats per minute. He was treated with epinephrine, followed by dopamine. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) oxygen delivery was instituted. Dialysis was discontinued after four hours, and management was guided by his wishes regarding resuscitation as conveyed by his family. Initially, the directive was that there should be no further escalation of care. Repeat laboratory studies obtained five hours after dialysis revealed a continued metabolic acidosis with an arterial pH of 7.14, lactic acid of 18.9 mmol/L, and AG of 42. Dopamine was continued; blood pressure stabilized, and the patient became considerably more responsive. After a discussion with the patient and family, a second, slow, and low-efficiency dialysis was performed with a blood flow of 200 ml/min, lasting for eight hours. During the first hospital day, a total of 12 hours of dialysis was delivered. Following the second dialysis, lactic acid decreased to 2.2 mmol/L and arterial pH was found to be 7.44. On the second hospital day, the patient\u2019s urine output increased; blood pressure was found to be 111/57 mmHg, and dopamine was discontinued. Oxygenation improved, and he was transferred out of intensive care on the fifth hospital day. He was discharged from the hospital on day 12 with a Cr of 2.1 mg/dl and CO2 of 21 mmol/L. Metformin and lisinopril had been discontinued. At the two-month follow-up, the patient had a Cr of 1.1 mg/dL. A summary of his course is shown in Figure .

    "question": "A 57-year-old man was admitted to the ED with complaints of syncope and weakness. We noticed that in his medical history, leeches were applied to treat the diabetic wounds on his feet two hours before he attended our clinic. After this, the leeches spontaneously detached but he observed bleeding from his bites and bleeding did not stop in spite of compression with tight bandages. A review of the patient\u2019s past medical history revealed hypertension, diabetes mellitus, diabetic foot, ischemic heart disease and coronary artery bypass surgery.\nVital signs were as follows; fever: 36.6\u00b0C, blood pressure: 85/50 mmHg, heart rate: 112/min and respiratory rate: 28/min. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the whole abdomen. Ampulla was empty with rectal examination. There was an ulcerative lesion with size 5x3 cm on the site of the amputated first toe. Additionally, there were multiple bites due to leech therapy on both feet (Figure ).\nLaboratory tests indicated the following: hemoglobin: 7.6 g/dL, white blood cells: 9370/mm3, platelets: 147000/mL, blood urea nitrogen: 29.1 mg/dL, creatinine: 1.98 mg/dL, glucose: 527 mg/dL, Na: 127 mmol/L, K: 6 mmol/L, CL: 94.5 mmol/L, C-reactive protein: 1.27 mg/dL and other routine blood tests and coagulation functions were all normal. Blood gas analysis revealed pH: 7.26, pO2: 86 mmHg, and bicarbonate: 20.2 mmol/L. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) showed gas in the intrahepatic biliary ducts. No obstructive pathology was found to mesenteric blood flow on Doppler USG. CT without intravenous contrast was performed because of abnormal renal function tests. CT revealed gas near the stomach, among colon segments (pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, PSI) and intrahepatic biliary ducts in central and left hepatic lobe (hepatic portal venous gas, HPVG) (Figure , Figure , respectively).\nThe patient was referred to another hospital that had an intensive care unit and started conservative treatment with antibiotics and intravenous fluid. Twelve hours after treatment, his general condition did not improve and signs of diffused peritonitis were observed on abdominal examination. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. Necrosis was found in the terminal ileum and the entire colon during laparotomy. Doppler USG detected low flow in the vessels supplying these necrotic segments. However, resection was decided due to necrosis of these segments. These necrotic intestinal segments were resected and an end-ileostomy was performed.

Her respiration was spontaneous and regular at the rate of 18 breaths/min. Her pupils were normal in size and reacting to light and neck rigidity and Kernig\u2019s sign were absent. Bilateral chest was clear on auscultation. Following admission, she had generalised tonic clonic convulsions which was unresponsive to 4 mg Intravenous (IV) Lorazepam. Immediately Inj. Thiopentone was given and her airway was secured with a tracheal tube. Her initial arterial blood gas (ABG) was as follows: pH - 6.86, PaCO2 - 72 mm Hg, PaO2 - 108 mm Hg, HCO3 - 12.7, Base deficit - 21.3, Na+ - 132 meq/l, K+ - 3 meq/l, Ca2+ - 9.3 mg/dl and glucose of 200 mg/dl. Immediately, she was provided with 100 meq of sodium bicarbonate (7.5%) and was put on controlled mandatory mode ventilation with FiO2 0.5, tidal volume 400 ml and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The ventilatory settings were periodically adjusted to achieve normocapnoea and normooxaemia. We corrected the hypokalemia with intravenous inj. potassium chloride at the rate of 20 meq/hr. Renal function test, coagulation profile and urine examination of the patient were within normal limits. Liver function test of the patient showed an ALT (Alanine transferase) and AST (Aspartate transferase) of 63 IU/L and 83 IU/L, respectively, with out any other abnormalities.\nDetailed history revealed that the patient was a diagnosed case of pulmonary tuberculosis and was on antitubercular therapy and had consumed nearly 10 tablets of some medication. We strongly suspected an acute intoxication of isoniazide (due to the clinical presentation) and immediately gastric lavage was done with 100 g charcoal mixed with 50 g of sorbitol through a nasogastric tube.

    "question": "A 14-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our institution for evaluation of recurrent hypoglycemic attacks which occurred especially in the mornings during the preceding two months. He had been diagnosed with T1DM at the age of five years and was treated with insulin in a dose of 0.7 to 1U/kg since that time. Recently, he started to develop recurrent attacks of hypoglycemia for which his insulin dose was decreased to 0.3U/kg. He had lost 2.5kg of weight and developed a craving for salt. He suffered from fatigue and dizziness. He was born and resided in a small village in Upper Egypt to unrelated Egyptian parents. He was the sixth child in his family with no history of diabetes or other auto immune diseases among family members. He had frequent hospital admissions for control of blood sugar. He was born at term with a birth weight of 3550 grams. Apart from post circumcision bleeding that was done at the age of two years by a barber, there was nothing significant in his past medical history. On physical examination, his body temperature was 36.1C, pulse rate was 92/min, blood pressure was 80/45mmHg, his height was in the 10th percentile while his weight was in the 25th percentile. He had no pallor, jaundice, or hyperpigmentation of either the skin or mucous membranes. His thyroid gland was not enlarged either on inspection or palpation. He was prepubertal: pubic and axillary hair Tanner stage 1 and testicular volume 3ml. He had slight abdominal distension, his liver and spleen were not enlarged and there was no evidence of ascities. Skin examination revealed vitiligo in the form of multiple hypopigmented areas located over the chest and abdomen. Serum biochemistry on admission showed an average blood glucose level of 77mg/dL (normal range: 82 to 110mg/dL), hemoglobin A1c 7.5% (normal range: 3.0 to 6.1), potassium: 5.9mmol/L (normal range 3.5 to 5), sodium 121mmol/L (normal range: 130 to 145) and calcium 9.7mg/dL (normal range: 8 to 10.5). Levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within the normal range. Liver function tests revealed bilirubin 11umol/L (normal <20umol/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 186IU/L (normal <50IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 123IUL (normal <50IU/L), alkaline phosphatase 108IU/L, (normal <350IU/L), and albumin 38g/L (normal range: 35 to 45g/L). Complete blood count, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels were normal. Viral hepatitis screens (HAV IgM, HBsAg, HBsIgM and IgG, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus) were negative. Anti-HCV and hepatitis C virus\u2013polymerase chain reaction (HCV\u2013PCR) were positive, with a viral load of 88,440IU/mL. Anti-endomysial antibodies were not detected. There were no serological features of autoimmune hepatitis (anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibody, and anti-parietal cell antibody were negative), anti-adrenal antibodies were positive and serum immunoglobulins were normal. Hormonal assays revealed cortisol <1.0ug/dL (normal range: 6 to 24), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) > 1250pg/mL (normal range: 20 to 100), a peak cortisol level below 0.2mcg/dL after intravenous ACTH stimulation test (250mcg). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was 6.11uIU/mL (normal range: 0.4 to 5.0). Anti-thyroglobulin (Tg autoantibodies) were 217.8IU/mL (normal: <120), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO autoantibodies) 5176IU/mL (normal 60), and free thyroxine 1.4ng/dL (normal range: 0.7 to 2.0). The serum luteinizing hormone was 0.1mIU/ml (normal range: 2.9 to 21.7), follicle-stimulating hormone 0.2mIU/ml (normal range: 5 to 30), testosterone 0.02ng/mL (normal range: 9.0 to 40.0), prolactin 13ng/mL (normal range: 3 to 30). Insulin C-peptide was <0.50ng/mL (normal range: 1.5 to 3.5). Parathormone (PTH) was 33.4pg/mL (normal range: 2 to 72). Thyroid ultrasonography revealed heterogeneous echogenicity without any nodules, while ultrasonography of the abdomen was normal. His immunogenetic study demonstrated that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing was HLA-DR3. Based on combinations of 1DM, subclinical hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, vililligo and HLA-DR3, a diagnosis of APS2 was made. The presence of positivity for both anti-HCV and HCV-RNA with elevated ALT and AST levels even in the absence of hepatomegaly confirmed the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection. His general condition improved gradually following the administration of hydrocortisone (10mg twice daily) and fludrocortisone (0.1mg twice daily). His diabetes was controlled with intensive multiple daily insulin injections. He was referred to the regional hepatology unit for further assessment including liver biopsy and consideration of hepatitis C eradication therapy but his father preferred to delay the treatment because he was worried about the side effects of the treatment.

    "question": "A 58-year-old Saudi diabetic female presented with left-sided involuntary movements. Unilateral movement was continuous, choreoathetotic, purposeless, non-stereotyped, and involved the face (twitching) and upper and lower extremities. It developed subacutely over 2 weeks. The movement was distressful to the patient and interfered with her activities of daily living and gait, causing recurrent falls. However, it ceased during sleep. She had poorly controlled diabetes for approximately 20 years, and was maintained on oral hypoglycemic agents. She was not on hormone replacement therapy or any other medications to which these symptoms could be attributed. There was no family history of movement disorders, and no clinical features suggestive of connective tissue diseases. Past medical history was of no relevance. Apart from the hemichorea involving the left side of the face and upper and lower extremities, her neurological examination was unremarkable; with normal higher mental function, and normal cranial and sensory nerve examination.\nOn admission, she was hyperglycemic with a random serum glucose of 30.3 mmol/L, (normal level <6.5 mmol/L); and her glycosylated hemoglobin was 13.5%, normal level=4-6%. Urine was negative for ketones. Expectedly, serum potassium was 5.6 mmol/L (normal level=3.5-5.0 mmol/L), and sodium was 133 mmol/L, (normal level=135-145 mmol/L), but other electrolytes were normal. Her blood count, coagulation profile, liver function tests, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were all within normal. Lipid profile showed dyslipidemia (cholesterol 9.81 mmol/L, triglycerides 4.61 mmol/L, high-density lipoprotein 1.1 mmol/L, and low-density lipoprotein 6.61 mmol/L). Further workup reinforced the evidence of poor diabetic control; her ophthalmologic examination revealed moderate to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, and her protein to creatinine ratio was 2000.\nA CT scan taken on admission was normal. Non-enhanced brain MRI () was obtained the next day and demonstrated an area of hyperintensity on T1 weighted images; involving the left caudate, putamen, and internal globus pallidus. There was no restriction on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map was normal. For glycemic control, she was started on an insulin regimen (bedtime insulin glargine and preprandial insulin aspart) with sitagliptin.\nInitially she was treated with lorazepam (2-6 mg/day) to control her HH. While lorazepam improved the quality of her sleep, it had no effect on the chorea in her waking hours. Valproic acid (400 mg/day) had no clear effect on chorea and was discontinued due to intolerance. She was then given haloperidol (gradually titrated from 1 mg/day to 8 mg/day) and clonazepam (titrated from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day). She showed clinical improvement after a few days with improvement in her daily activities and gait. Initially, there was more improvement in her lower extremities than upper extremities and the face over a period of 2 weeks. However, she achieved a satisfactory glycemic control, with a fasting serum glucose ranging from 6 to 7.8 mmol/L. With the initiation of neuroleptics and the glycemic control, the hemichorea steadily improved. She was discharged and followed up at an outpatient clinic. Three months later, she was in stable condition and had no recurrence of chorea. What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 12-year-old female, previously healthy, was admitted from the emergency department to the intensive care unit with a two weeks history of fever and multiple asymmetrical joint swelling and pain. Her admission temperature was 39.6\u00b0C, heart rate (HR) 130 beats/min, arterial blood pressure (BP) 127/57 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 35 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 93% on air. On examination, the patient had hair lice with multiple scratch marks on her scalp, bilateral pleural effusion, ejection systolic murmur grade 2/6 over the aortic area, tender hepatomegaly (3 cm below the costal margin, liver span 10 cm), and multiple joint swelling, redness, and tenderness involving the right middle finger, right hip, and both knees and ankles. Admission laboratory results revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6000 cells/mm3, lymphocytes 0.9\u00d7109cells/l, granulocytes 4.5\u00d7109\u00b7cells/l, monocytes 0.2\u00d7109cells/l, reticulocytes 28\u00d7109cells/l, platelets 156,000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin 107 g/l, serum sodium 125 mmol/l, serum potassium 4.8 mmol/l, serum glucose 4.3 mmol/l, serum urea 20.7 mmol/l, serum creatinine 90 mmol/l, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1427 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 408 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 307 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 184 IU/L, albumin 19 g/l, gamma-glutamate transferase (GGT) 110 IU/L, creatine kinase (CK) 142 IU/L, total bilirubin 145 mmol/l, serum osmolality 289 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality 647 mOsm/kg. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.2, prothrombin time (PT) 14 (control 12), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 36 (control 34). Screening tests for sickle cell disease, hepatitis A, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative; however, she tested positive for anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs Ag) antibodies. Chest X-ray confirmed the presence of bilateral pleural effusion (right > left) and showed widened mediastinum with a pear-shaped heart suggestive of pericardial effusion. A twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST-segment elevation with generalized T-wave inversion. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed moderate size pericardial effusion and no evidence of endocarditis or valvular heart disease. Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were obtained in the emergency department and the patient was started empirically by the emergency department physician on ceftazidime 1.3 g intravenous (IV) every 8 hours and flucloxacillin 1.2 g IV every 6 hours. In addition, a right chest tube thoracostomy was inserted and placed to underwater seal; 800 ml of serous fluid was drained and there was no air leak. Analysis of pleural fluid showed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 5 IU/L, albumin 19 g/L, and pH 7.37. Gram-positive cocci in clusters were seen on Gram staining of the pleural fluid (admission sample). The patient's hair was shaved and she was started on anti-lice shampoo. Sputum microscopy was negative for acid-fast bacilli and a sample for mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and polymerase chain reaction test was sent off.\nOn the second day, the patient became more tachypneic (RR 40 breaths/min) and hypotensive (BP 90/40 mmHg). Her trachea was intubated, lungs were mechanically ventilated, antibiotics were changed to meropenem to broaden her coverage, and she was started on dopamine and norepinephrine infusions. After initiation of mechanical ventilation, air leak from the right chest tube was observed suggesting the presence of bronchopleural fistula, however, she maintained her SpO2 > 95% on FiO2 0.4. Echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis was performed and 500 ml of pus was aspirated and a pig-tail catheter was inserted into the pericardium. Pericardial fluid analysis showed proteins 42 g/l, albumin 27 g/l, and Gram positive cocci in clusters on microscopy. Chest X-ray showed right minimal hydropneumothorax. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed perinephric and subhepatic collections with free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from sputum, blood, pleural fluid, and pericardial aspirate. Urine cultures were negative. Rheumatoid factor levels were slightly above the upper range of normal at 48.8 IU/L. Cytomegalovirus IgM antibodies were negative, but the IgG titer was 1/21,000 IU/L.\nOn day 4, air started to leak continuously through the pericardial pig-tail catheter which was still draining pus and the air leak was most marked during mechanical inspiration. A broncho-pericardial or broncho-pleuropericardial fistula was suspected. The pig-tail catheter was inadvertently clamped and the patient's BP decreased to 80/50 mmHg and HR increased to 120 beats/min. BP and HR returned to baseline values after de-clamping the catheter. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed pneumopericardium [Figures and ] and hydropneumothorax []. The radiologist injected radio-opaque contrast material easily into the pericardial pig-tail catheter and the contrast material immediately spilled over into the right pleural cavity []. A CT fistulogram, thus, confirmed the presence of communication between the right pleural space and the pericardium []. The cardiothoracic surgeon recommended conservative management given the patient status at the time. On day 5, the abdominal collections were aspirated laparoscopically. On day 11, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation and was bleeding from everywhere. On day 13, she died of multi-organ failure and her parents refused an autopsy.

    "question": "A 48-year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus presented with complaints of fever, chills, headaches, fatigue, myalgia, and weakness of one-week duration. She did not have any other contributory past medical, surgical, social, or family history. On physical examination, she was in mild distress secondary to her myalgias. Vital signs showed a temperature of 36.6\u00b0C, blood pressure of 175/105 mmHg, pulse of 80 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18/minute, and pulse oxymetry at 100% on room air. Pulmonary, cardiac, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable on admission. Notably, the neurologic examination was also unremarkable on admission.\nThe patients\u2019 initial labs revealed a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sodium of 129 mmol/L (normal range: 135-145 mmol/L), potassium of 3.4 mmol/L (normal range: 3.4-4.7 mmol/L), glucose of 337 mg/dL (normal range: 70-99 mg/dL), and calcium of 9.3 mg/dL (normal range: 8.6-10.2 mg/dL). Other labs showed C-reactive protein of 0.14 mg/dL, D-dimer of 0.67, creatinine kinase of 28, and hemoglobin A1C of 10.9%. The chest X-ray of the patient was unremarkable, but computed tomography (CT) of the chest did reveal ground-glass opacities in the upper and lower bilateral lung fields consistent with a COVID-19 presentation (Figure ).\nThe patient was placed on observation status secondary to her SARS-CoV-2 infection. Her hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and elevated blood pressure resolved on follow-up. On day two, the patient had a complaint of \u201cdry eye\u201d on the left. Examination of the face revealed asymmetric forehead folds, inability to raise the left eyebrow, and left facial droop. There was no bilateral component. The remainder of the neurologic examination was within normal limits. Therefore, a diagnosis of Bell\u2019s palsy was made and the patient was started on empiric steroids (prednisone 20 mg daily for five days), valacyclovir (1 g TID for seven days), and doxycycline (100 mg BID). The doxycycline was discontinued once the Lyme disease titers returned negative and the patient finished her course of empiric valacyclovir and steroids.

Ultrasound revealed bilateral polycystic kidneys with features of thick wall and intracystic debris in one upper pole cyst of right kidney. Emergency non-contrast computerized tomogram of abdomen revealed features of bilateral emphysematous cyst infection [] with features of pyelonephritis. A provisional diagnosis of EPN with diabetic ketoacidosis was made. His initial management included intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin + tazobactum 4.5 gm q8h and levofloxacin 500 mg q24h), IV fluids, insulin infusion (regular insulin titrated to maintain capillary blood glucose range of 100\u2013150 mg/dl), and supportive measures. Percutaneous aspiration of both the cysts was done under real-time ultrasound guidance on day 2. About 250 ml of purulent fluid was aspirated. Gram stain revealed multiple gram-negative bacilli. Urine and blood cultures showed no growth. Chest X-ray did not reveal any abnormality. Culture of pus revealed Escherichia coli (non-ESBL) sensitive to meropenem and pazufloxacin. Antibiotics were changed to meropenem, pazufloxacin from day 4. Patient became afebrile on day 6. Antibiotics were continued for a period of 3 weeks. Repeat ultrasound done after 3 weeks showed significant resolution of cyst collection on both sides. Patient was discharged on day 22 with oral antibiotics (faropenem and levofloxacin).

    "question": "A 13-year-old previously healthy female presented to a local hospital with a 1-month history of polydipsia and polyphagia and a 1-day history of fatigue, pallor, and Kussmaul breathing. Her initial blood glucose level was unobtainable due to serum appearing \u201cmilky\u201d and the resultant turbidity interfering with the lab assay. Triglycerides were measured at 3,540 mg/dL (40.0 mmol/L). Urinalysis showed glycosuria and ketonuria. After the patient received appropriate fluid resuscitation, she was started on an insulin drip at 0.05 U/kg/h and transferred to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for management of DKA, severe lipemia, and concern for possible cerebral edema.\nOn arrival to the PICU, the patient was tachycardic (heart rate of 166), tachypneic (respiratory rate of 41) with Kussmaul breathing, and disoriented. Her capillary blood gas revealed metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation with a pH 7.10, pCO2 11.1 mm Hg, and HCO3 3.5 mmol/L. Her metabolic panel was remarkable for hyponatremia (sodium 121 mmol/L, uncorrected for hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia), hypochloremia (chloride 85 mmol/L), acidosis (bicarbonate 6 mmol/L) with an anion gap of 30 mmol/L, hyperglycemia (glucose 533 mg/dL), and acute kidney injury with a blood urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL and creatinine 1.51 mg/dL. Potassium level was normal (4.5 mmol/L). Triglycerides were 7,556 mg/dL (85.4 mmol/L). Due to concern for cerebral edema, an intravenous dose of mannitol (0.5 g/kg) was given that resulted in improvement in her neurological status. She became more alert, oriented, and interactive and quickly returned to her neurological baseline.\nThe patient was treated with appropriate fluid replacement and insulin infusion of 0.1 U/kg/h. She had an uneventful resolution of her electrolyte abnormalities and hyperglycemia and successfully transitioned to subcutaneous insulin after 24 h. Her triglyceride levels initially increased to 22,228 mg/dL (251.2 mmol/L) but then trended down to 4,876 mg/dL (55.1 mmol/L). She was allowed to have a low-fat diet and her triglyceride levels rebounded to 14,443 mg/dL (163.2 mmol/L). She was noted to have scattered yellow-tinged papules on her upper and lower extremities, which were diagnosed by dermatology as eruptive xanthomas in the setting of hypertriglyceridemia (). She was also found to have mild pancreatitis with a lipase level of 272 U/L (normal 11 - 82 U/L). Liver transaminase levels were normal. An abdominal ultrasound revealed hepatosplenomegaly that was thought to be resulting from acute systemic metabolic abnormalities.\nDue to severe and worsening hypertriglyceridemia, she was placed back on insulin and glucose infusions with restricted oral intake. Lipid-lowering treatment was started with oral fenofibrate 54 mg daily and omega-3-acid ethyl esters 4 g daily. After 7 days her triglyceride level had decreased to 1,337 mg/dL (15.1 mmol/L) and she transitioned back to subcutaneous insulin and a low-fat diet. Her triglyceride levels remained stable for 2 days on that regimen. The fenofibrate was increased to 145 mg daily and the omega-3-acid ethyl esters were discontinued. She was discharged to home with a triglyceride level of 1,187 mg/dL (13.4 mmol/L). Her treatment course and triglyceride levels are presented in .\nAt follow-up in diabetes clinic one month later, her triglycerides were normal at 65 mg/dL (0.73 mmol/L). She was complaining of vague musculoskeletal and abdominal discomfort intermittently and, therefore, the fenofibrate treatment was discontinued with close follow-up with a lipid specialist.

    "question": "On October 11, 2011, a 23-year-old G3P2 (both alive) woman was referred to our department on a suspicion of a malignant ovarian disease. She had presented at the referring clinic 2 weeks earlier with abdominal distension, pain, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. She was 10 weeks pregnant; her last menstrual period was on August 1, 2011. The abdominal pain had increased 2 days prior to referral despite taking analgesics (paracetamol). She did not have any previous medical or surgical disease, and her gynecological history was unremarkable. Menarche was at the age of 12, and menstrual cycles were regular. She had two normal vaginal deliveries at term, in 2008 and 2010.\nShe was well-nourished and weighed 58 kg, in acute distress and mild dyspnea. Temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure were within normal limits. Her physical examination revealed a moderately distended, tender, and tense abdomen with positive shifting dullness on percussion. The bowel sounds were normal. On pelvic examination, the uterine size and ovaries could not be made out because of the distention and tenderness, but bilateral irregular and mobile adnexal masses could be palpated with difficulty. Pelvic ultrasound revealed a single viable fetus at 11 weeks (crown-rump length 38 mm), with bilateral multilocular cystic ovarian masses, measuring 18.7 cm \u00d7 13.1 cm on the right and 14.6 cm \u00d7 12.6 cm on the left, associated with the moderate generalized peritoneal free fluid collection.

She had intravenous fluid (normal saline) at least 2000 ml per day, and liberal oral fluid intake encouraged. Medications included oral bromocriptine 2.5 mg daily for 5 days in addition to oral tramadol, piriton, metoclopramide, vasoprin, and ranitidine. During hospitalization, daily weighing, and abdominal girth measurements showed an increase from 58\u201363 kg to 89\u201392 cm, respectively, but there were no respiratory difficulties and her vital signs remained stable, the daily urine out-put was satisfactory. She responded well to treatment and at discharge, after 7 days; a full blood count, electrolytes, liver function, and coagulation profile gave results within normal limits. Hct was 34%; she weighed 63 kg, and abdominal girth was 88 cm.\nShe was seen weekly at the clinic. Resolution of the ascites and decrease in follicular size occurred gradually, demonstrated by clinical and ultrasonographic studies. On November 01, 2011; she had no complaints, she weighed 60 kg, abdominal girth was 84 cm and Hct; 32%, ultrasonography revealed a single active fetus of 13 weeks gestation, with regressed adnexal masses with no ascites [].

Clinically, she had an oral temperature of 39.6\u00b0C and was severely dehydrated, with a heart rate of 116 beats/min and a blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg. On examination, she was lethargic with no focal neurological deficit or neck stiffness. Examination of the heart, chest and abdomen was unremarkable. Blood laboratory investigations showed: sugar 46 mmol/l, sodium 181 mmol/l (135\u2013145 mmol/l), potassium 4.6 mmol/l (3.4\u20134.9 mmol/l), urea 11 mmol/l (2\u20136 mmol/l) and creatinine 80 \u00b5mol/l (60\u201380 \u00b5mol/l). Arterial blood gas analysis showed: Pao2 8.7 kPa, Paco2 4.2 kPa, pH 7.39, and bicarbonate 20 mmol/l (22\u201328 mmol/l). Urine showed marked pyuria and negative ketones. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Escherichia coli. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed normal biochemistry and cell count with negative microbiological workup. Brain CT was normal. The patient was managed as a case of HHS with Gram-negative sepsis. Immediate treatment with 0.45% saline and intravenous insulin infusions was started together with appropriate intravenous antibiotics. The saline infusion was started initially at 250 ml/h, with modification of rate and concentration so that the fall in serum sodium was not allowed to exceed 0.5 mmol/l per hour (table ). In the second week of the inpatient course, the patient's lethargy did not improve, in spite of fever subsidence, haemodynamic stabilization and proper correction of the biochemical parameters. She also developed behavioural changes with bouts of agitation and disorientation. Neurological evaluation revealed brisk deep tendon reflexes of the 4 limbs, but plantar responses were normal and there was no weakness. At the end of the second week, a brain MRI was made. It showed a high signal intensity lesion in the posterior central part of the pons in T2-weighted images (fig. ), consistent with CPM. The patient did not give any history of previous neurological disorder or trauma, and, consequently, she did not have any previous brain CT or MRI studies. A diagnosis of CPM in relation to hypernatraemia of HHS was concluded. No specific treatment was given, and the patient was closely observed. She fully recovered and was discharged in a normal mental and physical state by the end of the fourth week. We could not obtain a repeat brain MRI as the patient was lost to follow-up.

    "question": "A 67-year-old male with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, non-insulin\u2013dependent diabetes mellitus, and hypertension presented with progressively worsening dyspnea and cough of three weeks duration. Two months prior to presentation, the patient had undergone cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) placement for nonischemic cardiomyopathy and left bundle branch block with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%. No operative complications were reported.\nVital signs were within normal limits (pulse: 84 beats per minute; blood pressure: 132/68 mmHg; temperature: 36.1\u00b0C; respiratory rate: 18; oxygen saturation: 94% on room air). Physical examination was significant only for bibasilar rales; no pericardial friction rub or elevated jugular venous pressure were appreciated, and there were no clinical signs or symptoms concerning for tamponade. Laboratory studies demonstrated hyponatremia (sodium: 123 mEq/L; corrected for hyperglycemia: 127 mEq/L), hyperglycemia (glucose: 260 mg/dL), and normocytic anemia (hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume: 86.7 fL). N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was elevated to 239 pg/mL, which was near the patient's baseline. Serum potassium, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an atrial-paced ventricular rhythm consistent with prior pacemaker placement. Two-view chest radiography revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, minimal bibasilar atelectasis, and appropriate placement of the pacemaker leads ().\nThe patient was started on a fluid restriction of 1500 milliliters per day for hyponatremia and suspected heart failure exacerbation. However, subsequent laboratory studies showed significant worsening of the hyponatremia; by the second hospital day, the patient's serum sodium had decreased from 123 to 119 mEq/L (corrected for hyperglycemia: 123 mEq/L). Further investigation revealed serum blood urea nitrogen of 12 mg/dl, serum glucose of 264 mg/dl, calculated serum osmolality of 256 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality of 310 mOsm/kg H2O, and urine sodium of 42 mEq/L. Hypothyroidism was ruled out with a thyroid-stimulating hormone of 2.340 \u03bcIU/mL.\nAn echocardiogram demonstrated a large circumferential pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse (). Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 55% with normal diastolic function. Diastolic right ventricular collapse was absent. Echocardiographic features were consistent with early signs of cardiac tamponade. However, there were no clinical signs of tamponade and vital signs remained within normal limits.\nAn urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of approximately 1200 milliliters of sanguineous fluid. A follow-up echocardiogram was obtained one day after the procedure and demonstrated complete resolution of the effusion (). Serum electrolytes were monitored and showed a gradual improvement of the hyponatremia; serum sodium had increased from 120 to 123 mEq/L on the first postoperative day and to 131 mEq within 36 hours of the procedure (). Calculated serum osmolality also increased to 278 mOsm/kg. Analysis of the pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells and pathogens. Our patient's pericardial effusion was presumed to be secondary to his previous CRT-D placement. The patient was discharged home in stable condition on the third postoperative day. Outpatient follow-up four weeks later showed no recurrence of the pericardial effusion. What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 50-year-old male with history of type I diabetes mellitus presented with nausea, non-bloody emesis, and diffuse abdominal pain. He was not able to take insulin for a week as he ran out of his prescriptions. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 127/85 mmHg, and the patient was afebrile with normal oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 95% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed generalized tenderness and dry mucous membranes. Initial blood work revealed a white cell count of 24 k/mcL and hemoglobin and hematocrit of 19 g/dl and 53%, respectively, suggesting severe hemoconcentration. Comprehensive metabolic panel showed a blood glucose of 425 mg/dl, the anion gap was elevated at 27 and serum sodium was 127 meq/L with a remarkably elevated calcium of 17.3 mg/dl (normal range 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dl) and serum phosphorous level of 5.9 mmol/L (normal range 2.5 to 4.5 mmol/L). Serum bicarbonate was decreased at 20 meq/L, beta-hydroxybutyrate was elevated at 4.96 mmol/L (normal range of 0.02 to 0.27 mmol/L) and serum potassium level was normal. This combination of laboratory findings suggested a diagnosis of DKA. A thorough infectious workup to evaluate the cause of DKA was unremarkable. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was done which revealed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4 and avL with J-point elevations, no reciprocal ST-T wave changes, and normal QTc interval of 440 milliseconds (normal QT interval range 400 to 440 milliseconds) (Figure ).\nThese EKG changes were thought to be due to high calcium level as the patient denied any ischemic symptoms and cardiac troponin was minimally elevated at 0.04 ng/ml (reference range of acute myocardial infarction greater than 0.11 ng/ml). Transthoracic echocardiogram suggested a normal cardiac function. The patient was started on intravenous crystalloid boluses of normal saline with a regular insulin drip. Close monitoring of the basal metabolic panel including calcium level was performed. On day two of admission, patients anion gap close to 10 and he was bridged to multiple daily insulin injections. Serum calcium levels trended down to a normal level of 9.5 mg/dl with the resolution of DKA. An extensive workup to evaluate the cause of hypercalcemia was non-revealing. Random urine calcium levels were appropriately elevated at > 17.8 mg/dL while urinalysis showed glucosuria and ketonuria but was otherwise unremarkable. The serum parathyroid hormone was decreased at 5 pg/ml (reference range of 8-54 pg/ml) suggesting a parathyroid independent process, vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy was decreased at 17.3 pg/ml (reference range of 19.9-84 pg/ml) and parathyroid hormone-related peptide was normal. In addition, the patient denied taking vitamin D or calcium supplements at home. CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was normal excluding malignancy as the cause of hypercalcemia. As a result, the likely cause of this hypercalcemia was attributed to severe DKA and dehydration which corrected with hydration and treatment of DKA. Although the patient was given a dose of zoledronic acid but the calcium corrected before the effects of bisphosphonates could be seen (normally after 48 hours of administration). Due to the rapid correction of serum calcium level back to normal, other medical management (including calcitonin or diuretics) was not warranted. ECG changes also reverted back to normal with the correction of serum calcium levels (Figure ). What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?",

He was hospitalized in a rural health facility where his clinical picture was initially considered as due to prolonged seizure activity for which he received multiple anti-epileptic drugs. As he was progressively deteriorating, he was referred to a tertiary center. As per the caregiver\u2019s description and medical records received from the previous hospital, he was having abnormal, involuntary, rapid, brief and jerky movements involving face and upper limbs (predominantly right sided). Although there was no history of headache, fever, vomiting, and any focal weakness, the patient had significant involuntary weight loss in last 4 months. Family history and drug history were non-contributory.\nClinical examination revealed the patient was drowsy, dehydrated, cachectic, afebrile, tachycardic (130/min), normotensive (100/60 mmHg) and tachypneic (36/min). He had faciobrachial myoclonic jerks with asymmetric involvement of right upper limb more than left upper limb (distal more than proximal), with tonic neck deviation to left side withoutany abnormal movement of bilateral lower limbs (). The myoclonic jerks were not associated with any external cues or voluntary action. The tone and deep tendon reflexes of upper limbs could not be assessed due to persistent abnormal involuntary movements. The tone and deep tendon reflexes of lower limbs were normal; the plantar reflexes were flexor. Complete assessment of cranial nerves, sensory, cerebellar and autonomic functions could not be done. There was no sign of meningeal irritation and papilledema.\nAcute onset multifocal myoclonus associated with encephalopathy with a background of addiction and recent onset progressive involuntary weight loss had narrowed the differential diagnoses to toxic-metabolic and neuro-infectious etiologies. Bedside CBG was measured immediately and was found to be 695 mg/dL (normal, <200). Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed metabolic acidosis (pH- 7.28 [normal, 7.35\u20137.45], HCO3- -18 mEq/L [normal, 22\u201326], Na+- 117 mEq/L [normal, 135\u2013145] [131 mEq/L when corrected for hyperglycemia], anion gap- 18 mmol/L (normal<12), with normal serum osmolality, pO2, pCO2, K+, and ionic Ca2+). Urine examination showed glycosuria (3+) and ketonuria (2+); plasma beta-hydroxy-butyrate level was found to be 3.6mmol/L (normal, <1.5). Thus, a diagnosis of DKA was confirmed. Adequate hydration was ensured with normal saline followed by treatment with continuous intravenous regular insulin (at a rate of 8 IU/h)., Once CBG came down to less than 400 mg/dL, approximately 3 h after therapy, all movements disappeared. His metabolic derangements were completely corrected by next 2 days and CBG was fairly controlled with basal-bolus regimen.\nAfter stabilization he had absolutely normal hemodynamic and hydration status. Detailed neurological and other systemic examinations were within normal limits. His HbA1c was 10.62% (normal, <5.6), fasting and post-prandial blood glucose were 137 mg/dL (normal, <100) and 250 mg/dL (normal, <140) respectively. C peptide level was low [0.1 ng/ml (normal, 0.5\u20132.7)] with positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-65 antibodies that established the diagnosis of T1DM. The patient\u2019s oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2, by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction assay, was negative.\nAll other tests of the metabolic panel (complete hemogram, lipid profile, renal, liver, thyroid function tests) were within normal limits. Autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis profile [anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-thyroid antibodies, antibodies against leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (anti-LGl1), contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R)] were negative. Serological tests for HIV 1&2, and hepatitis B and C were negative. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal electroencephalogram (EEG), and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. The rest of his hospital stay was uneventful and did not have any recurrence of involuntary movements during a 2-month follow-up.

    "question": "A 43 year-old male was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital after his workplace colleagues noted increasingly strange behavior for three days. The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient\u2019s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.\nThough initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.\nIn the ED, the patient\u2019s temperature was 103.9\u00b0F (39.9\u00b0C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.\nInitial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0\u201310.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0\u201318.0], platelet count of 135 \u00d7 103/mm3 [lab range 150\u2013350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137\u2013145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98\u2013107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0\u201330.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9\u201320], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7\u20131.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70\u201399], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0\u201310]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0\u20130.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38\u2013126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13\u201369), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15\u201346). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5\u201310 WBC, 0\u20135 red blood cells (RBC), 5\u201310 epithelial cells, 5\u201310 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40\u201370], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12\u201360], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient\u2019s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient\u2019s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64. What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?",

    "question": "A 7-day-old female infant was brought to the emergency department with decreased responsiveness and poor feeding. She was born at 384/7 weeks' gestation, with a birthweight of 2770 g (10th\u201325th percentile) to a 38-year-old primiparous woman with adequate prenatal care. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational thrombocytopenia diagnosed in the third trimester, which required treatment with hydrocortisone. Her prenatal laboratory findings, including syphilis rapid plasma reagin, hepatitis Bs antigen, HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, were negative. The result of her group B Streptococcus screening test was positive. An urgent cesarean delivery was performed because of her nonreactive nonstress test at the obstetric clinic. Rupture of amniotic membranes occurred at delivery. The postdelivery course of infant was uncomplicated; the Apgar scores were 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. In the postnatal ward, the neonate fed poorly, with low maternal milk supply. The mother was seen by a lactation consultant who advised her to continue breastfeeding. The neonate was discharged from the hospital 48 hours after birth with a weight of 2,665 g (4% loss from birthweight), and the family advised to arrange follow-up with the primary care physician. The infant's platelet count, obtained before discharge because of the maternal history of gestational thrombocytopenia, was noted to be 180,000/\u03bcL (180 \u00d7 109/L). At the primary care physician visit on day 3 of age, the infant's weight was 2,475 g (\u223c11% lower than birthweight). She was noted to be otherwise well appearing though the mother continued to report difficulty with latching and breast milk supply. She received lactation consultation again in the office.\nOn day 6, the infant became increasingly lethargic and uninterested in feeding. She was taken to the emergency department (ED) where it was recorded that she had an average of 3 wet diapers/day and less than 1 stool/day over the past 2 days. In addition, the mother endorsed a history of right-sided gaze and head deviation for a few seconds while the infant was being placed in the car seat on the way to the ED. On initial physical examination at the ED, the infant was lethargic and minimally responsive, with a prolonged capillary refill time and appeared grossly dehydrated with standing skinfolds. Her vital signs were as follows: temperature, 34.2\u00b0C (93.5\u00b0F); heart rate, 184 beats/min; respiratory rate, 64 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 100% in room air. Her weight was 2,220 g (\u223c20% below birthweight). Multiple short self-limiting brief episodes of right gaze deviation and left arm tonic-clonic movements were also noted. Laboratory testing in the ED revealed the following.\nSodium 173 mEq/L (reference range 135\u2013145 mEq/L) Potassium 6.8 mEq/L (reference range 3.8\u20136.0 mEq/L) Chloride 130 mEq/L (reference range 95\u2013110 mEq/L) BUN 165 mg/dL (reference range 7\u201325 mg/dL) Creatinine 1.92 mg/dL (reference range 0.2\u20130.4 mg/dL) Bicarbonate 10 mEq/L (reference range 18\u201324 mEq/L) Glucose 111 mg/dL (reference range 75\u2013105 mg/dl)\nCapillary pH 7.29 (reference range 7.35\u20137.45) PaCO2 32 mm Hg (reference range 35\u201345 mm\u00b7Hg) Base excess \u221210 mEq/L\nWhite blood cells (WBC) of 18,700/\u03bcL reference range (5,000\u201320,000/\u03bcL) Hemoglobin of 16.7 g/dL (167 g/L) (reference 14.3\u201324.5 g/dl) Hematocrit of 53%, (reference 44\u201364%) Platelet count of 74,000/\u03bcL (reference 130\u2013450/\u03bcL)\nThere was no left shift on the CBC. In the ED, the infant received 2 normal saline boluses and was started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics and was transferred to a level IV neonatal intensive care unit for further care, where her vital signs improved. On examination, the infant was hypoactive but responsive to stimulation. She continued to have intermittent episodes of seizures (tonic-clonic seizures of both upper and lower extremity and right gaze deviation) on admission. Respirations were not labored, and heart sounds were normal on auscultation. Rest of the examination findings were within normal limits. Serum sodium concentration was 174 mEq/L, potassium 6.5 mEq/L, chloride 134 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 158 mg/dL, creatinine 1.61 mg/dL, and bicarbonate 15 mEq/L. Another normal saline bolus was given, and intravenous fluids continued. The WBC count was 11,800/\u03bcL, and the hemoglobin and hematocrit dropped to 13.3 g/dL and 41%, respectively. The platelet count dropped significantly to 9,000/\u03bcL. The infant continued to receive treatment for dehydration and sepsis. In addition, she was evaluated and treated for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and metabolic diseases. Head ultrasonography and computed tomography were performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage because of the suspected seizure and acute drop in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The scans revealed significant bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) involving the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles and basal cistern (Figures and ). In addition, a parenchymal hemorrhage was noted mainly in the ventral medial aspect of the thalamus and basal ganglia on the left side. A bedside ventricular tap was performed to relieve elevated intracranial pressure. She was given a loading dose of phenobarbital and video electroencephalography was performed, which showed that the patient continued to have electrographic seizures requiring multiple antiepileptic drug boluses of phenobarbital, levetiracetam, and fosphenytoin to stop the seizure. Further treatment included fluid rehydration with age-appropriate fluids aimed at correcting the hypernatremia by no more than 0.5 mmol/L per hour. The infant received several platelet and plasma transfusions. Electrolytes were checked every 4 to 6 hours, showing gradual improvement of levels. Also, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir was continued until sepsis and herpes simplex virus infection were ruled out. Hematologic, genetic, and metabolic testing was negative for any increased risk for bleeding or thrombosis.\nThe infant's neurologic state continued to deteriorate with the cessation of spontaneous movements, absent reaction to painful stimuli, and fixed and dilated pupils. She became apneic and was intubated to support respiration. Further brain imaging with magnetic resonance imaging, including venous and arterial angiography, showed stable IVH within the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. It also showed previously known parenchymal hemorrhages in the bilateral thalami and basal ganglia, which was more prominent on the left side. Arterial angiography showed no flow in the intracranial arteries, and venous angiography showed no flow in dural venous sinuses suggestive of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (Figures \u2013). The infant continued to remain apneic and was unable to wean off the ventilator. After extensive counseling, the parents decided against comfort care for the infant. As per their request, tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes were placed and the infant was discharged from the hospital. What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?",

CT angiogram showed large segment aortic occlusion (4 cm) just beyond the renal arteries and partial occlusive thrombus in the superior mesenteric artery with early ischemia (Figures and ). There were also multiple areas of bilateral renal infarcts left greater than right with the main renal arteries patent bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an echo dense mass, 2.4 cm \u00d7 2.8 cm, 1.2 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm in size, in the left ventricle with defined margins that are distinct from the endocardium seen throughout systole and diastole, consistent with left ventricular thrombus (Figures \u2013). Ejection fraction was estimated to be 15 %, with increased wall thickness and grade 3 diastolic dysfunction. There was mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with normal valve structure. CT head was obtained due to an altered mental status which was negative for acute bleeding. The patient became profoundly hypotensive which was likely due to cardiogenic shock despite being on maximum vasopressors. She developed limb ischemia due to compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. Interventional radiology and vascular surgery were consulted, surgical thrombectomy was done. The patient's status worsened developing rhabdomyolysis, shock liver, and acute kidney injury with severe metabolic acidosis. She could not tolerate continuous renal replacement therapy. The patient had an episode of ventricular fibrillation and expired after three days of being hospitalized. What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?",

    "question": "A 60-year-old gentleman was admitted with the presenting complaint of acute onset weakness of both the lower limbs (started as inability to stand up after squatting), inability to move both the lower limbs and breathlessness. He had no other presenting complaints including history of back pain, trauma, chest pain, palpitations or syncope. He had bilateral cystic bronchiectasis of the lungs of unknown etiology, cor pulmonale and he was a diabetic on oral hypoglycemic agents (glibenclamide, glimepiride) and a hypertensive on atenolol and spironolactone. His other medications were frusemide and theophylline + etofylline.\nOn admission, he was conscious oriented and his vitals were: Temperature - 99\u00b0F, pulse-110/min, BP-130/80 mm Hg, RR-26/min reg and O2 saturation-95% with 10litres/min of oxygen flow. He had clubbing, bilateral pitting pedal edema and bilateral symmetrical areflexic motor weakness of the lower limbs (Power 1/5) and absent bilateral plantar response. Lung examination showed bilateral coarse crepitations. All peripheral pulses were equally felt and the rest of the system examination was unremarkable. His average urine output was > 1000 ml/day. His previous renal function tests were normal, with a normal serum potassium level. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spine was advised by the neurologist.\nArterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.28, pCO2 60, pO2 159 and bicarbonate 27.8. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, right axis deviation, PR interval of 0.20 ms, right bundle branch block (RBBB), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and ST depression/T inversion in leads III, aVF and V1-V3.\nLaboratory investigations revealed blood sugar of 493 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 88 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, serum sodium of 119 mEq/L, serum potassium of 8.9 mEq/L, Hb-19.4g/dL, hematocrit-67% and WBC-8,200/cu.mm, creatine phosphokinase, was 95 IU L and thyroid profile was normal. Daily measurements of hemoglobin and PCV level did not show any evidence of ongoing hemolysis.\nChest X-ray and computed tomography chest showed bilateral cystic bronchiectasis of the lungs. Echocardiography showed dilated right atrium and ventricle, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, normal left ventricle size and systolic function and EF of 68%. Arterial Doppler of both lower limbs revealed thin plaques along the arteries with normal flow velocity.\nImmediate treatment for hyperkalemia included intravenous calcium gluconate, nebulised salbutamol, insulin infusion and potassium binding resin and potassium free diet. Repeat serum potassium after one hour of conservative management was still 8.7 mg/dL. The Nephrologist started him on immediate hemodialysis, as the serum potassium did not respond adequately to medical therapy and as he was still at high risk of life-threatening cardiac events. Salbutamol nebulization and insulin infusion were continued. After one cycle of hemodialysis, medications and potassium restriction, his serum potassium was 7.1 mg/dL but his motor power improved to 4/5 in both the lower limbs (he was able to lift both his legs against gravity and mild resistance). Repeat ECG post-hemodialysis was the same. Imaging was not performed initially as he required urgent treatment for the hyperkalemia. Subsequently there was remarkable improvement in motor power, MRI spine was withheld.\nHe was kept on non-invasive ventilation which was discontinued the next day. He required three cycles of hemodialysis before his serum potassium reached the normal range. Throughout the course of the illness, he had no episode of arrhythmia, heart block or cardiac arrest. At discharge, his serum potassium and renal function were within the normal range. He was able to walk normally without any disturbances in posture or balance and his motor power was 5/5 in all the 4 limbs.\nFollow-up was done after two weeks of discharge when he had normal motor power (able to walk and ride motorcycle) and normal potassium and renal function tests.

We noticed that in his medical history, leeches were applied to treat the diabetic wounds on his feet two hours before he attended our clinic. After this, the leeches spontaneously detached but he observed bleeding from his bites and bleeding did not stop in spite of compression with tight bandages. A review of the patient\u2019s past medical history revealed hypertension, diabetes mellitus, diabetic foot, ischemic heart disease and coronary artery bypass surgery.\nVital signs were as follows; fever: 36.6\u00b0C, blood pressure: 85/50 mmHg, heart rate: 112/min and respiratory rate: 28/min. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the whole abdomen. Ampulla was empty with rectal examination. There was an ulcerative lesion with size 5x3 cm on the site of the amputated first toe. Additionally, there were multiple bites due to leech therapy on both feet (Figure ).\nLaboratory tests indicated the following: hemoglobin: 7.6 g/dL, white blood cells: 9370/mm3, platelets: 147000/mL, blood urea nitrogen: 29.1 mg/dL, creatinine: 1.98 mg/dL, glucose: 527 mg/dL, Na: 127 mmol/L, K: 6 mmol/L, CL: 94.5 mmol/L, C-reactive protein: 1.27 mg/dL and other routine blood tests and coagulation functions were all normal. Blood gas analysis revealed pH: 7.26, pO2: 86 mmHg, and bicarbonate: 20.2 mmol/L. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) showed gas in the intrahepatic biliary ducts. No obstructive pathology was found to mesenteric blood flow on Doppler USG. CT without intravenous contrast was performed because of abnormal renal function tests. CT revealed gas near the stomach, among colon segments (pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, PSI) and intrahepatic biliary ducts in central and left hepatic lobe (hepatic portal venous gas, HPVG) (Figure , Figure , respectively).\nThe patient was referred to another hospital that had an intensive care unit and started conservative treatment with antibiotics and intravenous fluid. Twelve hours after treatment, his general condition did not improve and signs of diffused peritonitis were observed on abdominal examination. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy. Necrosis was found in the terminal ileum and the entire colon during laparotomy. Doppler USG detected low flow in the vessels supplying these necrotic segments. However, resection was decided due to necrosis of these segments. These necrotic intestinal segments were resected and an end-ileostomy was performed.

    "question": "A 38-year-old man presented to an emergency department with progressive weakness and decreased urine output after having vomited up to 20 times per day over a period of 7 days. The patient was referred to our intensive care unit. Before medical consultation, he was healthy, and no other symptoms were reported. Diarrhea, fever, chills, or abdominal pain was absent.\nClinical examination revealed a patient of normal weight (height: 180 cm, weight: 70 kg). Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated (150/80 mmHg, 105/min); the respiratory rate was normal (13/min), but oxygen saturation was low (89%). During blood pressure measurement, a positive Trousseau sign was noted. The mucous membranes were dry, and the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nArterial blood gas analysis revealed a metabolic alkalosis with partial respiratory compensation (pH: 7.71 [7.35\u20137.45], base excess: 40.5 mmol/l [-2-3 mmol/l], pCO2: 56.1 mmHg [32\u201345 mmHg], pO2: 43.5 mmHg [83\u2013108 mmHg], bicarbonate: 72.2 mmol/l [21\u201326 mmol/l], lactate: 2.8 mmol/l [0.5\u20131.6 mmol/l], chloride: 52 mmol/l [98\u2013106 mmol/l], sodium: 130 mmol/l [136\u2013146 mmol/l], potassium: 2.4 mmol/l [3.5\u20135.1 mmol/l], ionized calcium: 0.77 mmol/l [1.15\u20131.29 mmol/l] and glucose: 165 mg/dl [70\u2013105 mg/dl]).\nUltrasound revealed a distended and full stomach; the inferior vena cava was collapsing on inspiration. Otherwise, the ultrasound was unremarkable. The electrocardiography [] showed a prolonged QT interval (QTc 547 ms).\nLaboratory tests were consistent with acute kidney injury (creatinine: 5.2 mg/dl, urea: 176 mg/dl); liver function tests, coagulation tests, albumin, lipase, procalcitonin, total calcium, hemoglobin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Leukocytes were minimally elevated (11500/\u03bcl).\nWe suspected a prerenal acute kidney injury and a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to gastric losses of HCl and fluids. Initial management consisted of oxygen therapy to correct hypoxemia and intravenous fluid therapy with normal saline and potassium chloride. Initially, a balanced crystalloid solution was infused, and later normal saline with KCl (40 mmol/l) was used because of the higher chloride content. Metoclopramide was administered to promote gastric emptying. To prevent further gastric losses of HCl, a proton-pump inhibitor was given. The patient was put on nihil per os for 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, a total of 4.5 l of crystalloid fluid was infused. There was no further vomiting. A repeated bedside ultrasound revealed an empty stomach. The pH was corrected to 7.49, bicarbonate was reduced to 48.6 mmol/l, base excess was 23.4, chloride was 69 mmol/l, and potassium was still low at 2.8 mmol/l. There was hypoventilation with a pCO2 of 68.4 mmHg. We noted onset of diuresis. After 72 h of fluid therapy, the acid-base and electrolyte status was normal. Creatinine had decreased to 3.5 mg/dl. Small meals were tolerated.\nSince there was no evidence of an infectious etiology for the excessive vomiting and the ultrasound had shown a distended stomach, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed []. A significant stenosis of the duodenum was diagnosed. Although there was no ulcer visible, an occult ulcer was deemed to be possible. A portal hypertensive gastropathy was diagnosed while esophageal varices were absent. Helicobacter pylori testing was positive, so an eradication therapy was initiated. A repeated endoscopy confirmed the stenosis, but again, no ulcer was seen. Since a focused abdominal ultrasound did not reveal the reason for the stenosis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed to rule out malignancy such as pancreatic or gallbladder cancer or a thrombosis of the mesenteric vein. There was no evidence of malignancy or cirrhosis. An endosonography was done without evidence of malignancy or mesenteric vein thrombosis. At that point, the stenosis had partly resolved, and endoscopic passage was possible. We concluded that the temporary duodenal stenosis was caused most likely by portal hypertension of unknown etiology, and our differential diagnosis included idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension after exclusion of cirrhosis and portal vein obstruction.

    "question": "The patient is a 73-year-old female with past medical history of sero-positive ocular Myasthenia Gravis (with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody) and COPD who presented by helicopter with altered mental status and weakness. On presentation the patient was hypotensive and afebrile with a heart rate in the 20s. She received atropine en route and was started on a dopamine drip along with aggressive fluid resuscitation. Blood pressure improved to 111/54 with HR increasing to the low 30\u2019s. Lab work at outside hospital showed sodium 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.0 mmol/L, chloride 107 mmol/L, with a BUN of 41 mg/dL and creatinine 2.32 mg/dL. POC glucose was 191 and AST 55 U/L with ALT 37 U/L. Her hyperkalemia was treated with insulin and dextrose and had returned to normal limits by time of presentation. Repeat kidney, liver function tests, and serum electrolytes were within normal limits. Troponins were drawn and found to be 0.062 ng/mL with a Brain Natriuretic Peptide of 60 pg/ml. ECG was performed and showed patient had a complete heart block. The patient was admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit where transcutaneous pacing was attempted but found to be ineffective. The patient was brought to the cardiac cath lab for transvenous pacing. Review of prior to admission medications showed that the patient had taken her PO pyridostigmine prior to developing bradycardia with altered mental status. She denied taking any of her COPD medication prior to presentation including any short or long acting beta agonists. Neurology was consulted for further evaluation of causes of heart block in a patient with MG. Pyridostigmine was held for concern of its affect in leading to complete heart block. With pyridostigmine held, the patient reverted back to sinus rhythm and transvenous pacing was removed. Using the Naranjo scale for adverse drug reaction patient received a score of 6 for a probable adverse drug reaction. Given the patient\u2019s lack of infectious etiology, including negative Lyme serology, alternative pharmacological causes of heart block and reversion to sinus rhythm after removal of the offending agent, pyridostigmine was diagnosed as the causative agent. When the patient was stabilized she was discharged home with pyridostigmine held with close follow-up with her neurologist for further management of her MG.

    "question": "A 49-yr-old man presented to the emergency room with mental confusion and vomiting in December 2003. Two days earlier he had abrupt onset of abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Since then, he had exhibited slurred speech. A search of his home found no prescription medication. He had liver cirrhosis with hepatitis B. He had two episodes of hepatic encephalopathy since 2002, and had been on oral lactulose therapy.\nHis blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg, and pulse rate was 64 beats/min. On physical examination, he was neurologically in a disoriented and drowsy mental state. His abdomen was distended, and bowel sound was absent. Ascites were noted. Laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 3,000/\u00b5L; hemoglobin 8.1 g/dL; platelet count 22,000/\u00b5L; serum aspartate transaminase 65 U/L; alanine transaminase 32 U/L; albumin 1.9 g/dL; total bilirubin 3.5 mg/dL; ammonia 185 \u00b5g/dL; blood urea nitrogen 22.3 mg/dL; creatinine 1.2 mg/dL; sodium 143 mEq/L; potassium 4.5 mEq/L; glucose 110 mg/dL; prothrombin time 25.1 sec (2.2 in international normalized ratio); partial thromboplastin time 73.2 sec (vs. a control of 35 sec); alpha-fetoprotein 3.14 ng/mL.\nPlain abdomen (upright film) revealed multiple air-fluid levels, distention of bowel loops, and presence of bowel gas in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen (). Initially, we gave him lactulose enemas every 6 hr for one day. Oral lactulose was not used because of frequent vomiting and ileus. However, there was no improvement in his mental state. Furthermore, he became to a state of coma, and there was an elevation of his venous ammonia level (298 \u00b5g/dL). Computed tomography of the head revealed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or cerebrovascular injury. Therefore, with the consent of his family, we gave him 0.5 mg of neostigmine subcutaneously to improve his peristaltic movement. Three minutes after this treatment, there was a prompt evacuation of stool with a reduction in abdominal distention and an increase in bowel sound on physical examination. Then we gave him 2 L of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution through a nasogastric tube for 4 hr. After these treatments, his venous ammonia level decreased to the normal range (19.0-60.0 \u00b5g/dL) within 12 hr, and the coma disappeared after 2 days. Plain abdomen (upright film) also revealed no air-fluid level (). Then, oral lactulose therapy was restarted, and his condition remained stable. After 5 days, he was discharged from the hospital.

    "question": "A 47-year-old man who visited our department of family medicine, complained that he was experiencing chronic fatigue. His fatigue started about 1 year ago, and worsened with stress or after a day of work. His fatigue had previously improved after resting and sleeping but not for the last 6 months. He did not have a remarkable medical history, with the exception of treatment for reflux esophagitis. His dietary history included multivitamins and 4 weeks' consumption of red ginseng, 6 months ago. He did not smoke and consumed alcohol approximately twice a week. Additionally, he did not have any sleeping disorder of symptoms related to the digestive, nervous and circulatory systems, the results of a depression test were also normal, confirming that he was not suffering from any depressive disorder. Our patient's body temperature, heartbeat, and blood pressure were normal. No unusual signs were noted during simple neurologic testing or physical examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, and muscle-bone system. There were no palpable lymph nodes in his neck, axilla, and perineum. The results of a peripheral blood test conducted to diagnose chronic fatigue were also normal as follows: hemoglobin, 15.6 mm Hg; platelets, 267/el; white blood cells, 7,390/bl; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 3 mm/h. In serum chemistry testing, the following levels were noted: aspartate aminotransferase, 34 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 35 IU/L; total protein/albumin, 7.5/4.8 g/dL; globulin, 2.6 g/dL; alkaline phosphatase, 182 IU/L; Ca/P, 9.9/3.9 mg/dL; fasting plasma glucose, 71 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 11.8 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.65 mg/dL; sodium, 150 mEq/L; potassium, 4.1 mEq/L; and thyroid-stimulating hormone, 3.6 id. The routine urine analysis results were also normal. Antinuclear antibody and acquired immune deficiency syndrome test results were negative, and no specific signs were observed on abdomen ultrasonography and colonoscopy. However, we observed chronic gastritis and reflux esophagitis during gastroscopy. We recommended aerobic exercise, provided supportive psychotherapy, and prescribed medication for reflux esophagitis. We also asked the patient to submit a dietary diary and visit us again after 1 month. One month later, the patient said he had experienced no improvement in his fatigue and that he was extremely fatigued after these workouts as well. His dietary diary revealed that he ate slices of raw tuna more than twice per week. We eventually learned that raw tuna was his favorite food and that he has been consuming it for the past 5 years, partly because of his occupation. Suspecting methyl-mercury exposure, we conducted a blood test. We also conducted the hair toxic mineral assay (HTMA), after confirming that he had not permed, dyed, or coated his hair or used any functional shampoos. Mercury levels from blood and urine tests were within normal limits. We subsequently administered the patient a dietary medication designed to remove heavy metals. Each capsule contains zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium, and L-cysteine.\nAfter administering a dietary medication designed to remove heavy metals for 3 months, we found that the mercury concentration in our patient had decreased to 1.972. Using the fatigue severity scale (FSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) (), we measured the patient's degree of fatigue before and after proem intake for 3 consecutive months. His FSS score was 49, and his VAS was 9 before Proem intake. One month after Proem administration, his FSS score was 48 and VAS was 8. After 3 months of intake, his FSS score reduced to 17 and his VAS reduced to 2 (). What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?",

    "question": "A 76-year-old man with a past medical history of prostate cancer, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and recurring pneumonia was found to have a 10-mm nodule in the left lower lung without hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy on CT of the chest with IV contrast (Figure ). CT/PET scan showed abnormal uptake in the lung nodule (Figure ) and grade II cervical lymphadenopathy. CT-guided biopsy of the left lower lung was performed. Histopathology showed a malignant neoplasm of plasmacytoid cells (Figure ). A panel of immunohistochemical stains was performed to further evaluate the lesion. The tumor cells were strongly and diffusely immunoreactive for the melanocytic marker MART-1 (Figure ). However, stains for AE1/AE3, CK7, TIF-1, Napsin, P63, PSA, and PASP were negative. The immunohistochemical results confirmed a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma of unknown primary origin (MUP) to the cervical lymph nodes (LNs) and lungs. The patient had just finished four cycles of ipilimumab when he presented to our clinic complaining of fatigue, generalized weakness, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, and a 10-pound weight loss. The patient denied any fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or diarrhea. He denied any smoking or drug-use history. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 98/60 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The physical exam was unremarkable except for a slightly enlarged left cervical LN, dark pigmentation of the lips and gingiva, and sinus tachycardia without abnormal heart sounds or murmurs. The complete blood count was within normal limits.\nThe labs before starting ipilimumab were as follows - sodium (Na): 140 mEq/L (normal range: 135-145 mEq/L), potassium: (K) 3.6 mEq/L (normal range: 3.5-5.2 mEq/L), chloride (Cl): 105 mEq/L (normal range: 96-106 mEq/L), carbon dioxide (CO2): 28 mEq/L (normal range: 23-29 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 19 mg/dL (normal range: 6-20 mg/dL); creatinine (Cr): 1.3 mg/dL (normal range: 0.8-1.2 mg/dL); albumin: 3.9 g/dL, and glucose: 110 mg/dL (normal range: 64-100 mg/dL); morning cortisol: 17 \u03bcg/dL (normal range: 5-25 \u03bcg/dL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): 14 pg/mL (normal range: <80 pg/mL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 2.4 \u03bcU/mL (normal range: 0.4-5 \u03bcU/mL), and free thyroxin: 1.2 ng/dL (normal range: 0.8-2.8 ng/dL).\nThe labs after four cycles of ipilimumab were as follows - Na: 131 mEq/L, K: 4.1 mEq/L, Cl: 87 mEq/L, CO2: 27 mEq/L, BUN: 6 mg/dL, Cr: 1.1 mg/dL, albumin: 3.7 g/dL, and glucose: 89 mg/dL; morning cortisol: 5 \u03bcg/dL, ACTH: 120 pg/mL, TSH: 5 \u03bcU/mL, free thyroxin: 0.9 ng/dL, testosterone: 437 ng/dL (normal range: 270-1,070 ng/dL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): 3.5 mIU/mL (normal range: 1.5-12.4 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (LH): 6.8 mIU/mL (normal range: 1.24-7.8 mIU/mL), prolactin: 11 ng/mL (normal range: 2-18 ng/mL). Aldosterone was undetectable, and renin was 31 ng/mL/h (normal range for normal sodium diet: 0.6-4.3 ng/mL/h). The patient's HbA1C was 5.7%, and blood culture showed no growth. Urinalysis showed no abnormality and procalcitonin was negative. After the administration of 250 \u03bcg intravenous (IV) cosyntropin, cortisol was found to be 6.8 \u03bcg/dL at 30 mins, and 10.2 \u03bcg/dL at 60 mins, confirming the diagnosis of PAI.\nHe was diagnosed with grade 3 toxicity of ipilimumab and, given his severe symptoms limiting his daily activities, was hospitalized. The patient was immediately started on IV fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus, followed by 50 mg IV every six hours. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without IV contrast revealed no evidence of intraabdominal or pelvic pathology. MRI of the brain with and without contrast revealed no evidence of hypophysitis and no evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. Symptomatic improvement was seen at 24 hours. He was discharged with a four-day taper of hydrocortisone as per the recommendations of the endocrinologist. On his follow-up at the endocrinology clinic, his symptoms continued to improve. A repeat cosyntropin stimulation test showed cortisol levels within normal limits. The patient was started on a second checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, for 16 cycles of treatment while being followed up by an endocrinologist to monitor any side effects. A repeat CT/PET FDG 12 months later showed complete disappearance of the left lung nodule, indicating tumor remission (Figure ). What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?",

    "question": "A 31-year-old Caucasian Brazilian woman was admitted to the hospital with a 6-month history of chest pain and progressive dyspnea on exertion. She had angiofibromas on the malar regions of the face, which were present since her childhood. During her pregnancy, 11 years ago, she was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease associated with tuberous sclerosis. She had repetitive urinary tract infections, which resulted in progressive loss of renal function. Both her grandfather and child had polycystic kidneys, and her son also presented seizures. The patient also had a history of hemorrhoidal disease causing intermittent bleeding.\nOn examination, the patient appeared pale, and her vital signs included a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 bpm. Auscultation revealed the presence of fine crackles in both lungs, and a loud systolic heart murmur was heard on the precordium. Her abdomen was tense and painful to palpation, but there were no signs of peritoneal irritation. There was a palpable mass occupying the upper abdomen and both flanks; Traube's space was obliterated. Laboratory evaluation revealed a red blood cell (RBC) count of 2.81 \u00d7 106/mm3, hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 27% and platelet count of 130 \u00d7 103/mm3. Her WBC count was normal. Serum creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL; urea, 87 mg/dL; glucose, 85 mg/dL; sodium, 135 mEq/L; potassium, 4.2 mEq/L; uric acid 4.5 mg/dL; albumin, 2.8 g/dL; calcium, 7.9 mg/dL; phosphorus, 5.2 mg/dL; and magnesium, 2.4 mg/dL.\nChest computed tomography (CT) revealed cystic formations throughout the lungs, consistent with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Figure ), and the presence of a pericardial effusion. The echocardiogram showed a small pericardial effusion, and moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, and a normal systolic function. An abdominal CT scan demonstrated enlarged, heterogeneous kidneys, with multiple fat-density formations (negative densities, ranging from -15 to -148 Hounsfield units), which corresponded to angiomyolipomas (Figure ). Pulmonary function tests showed a severe obstructive pulmonary disorder with reduced forced vital capacity, and a positive response to bronchodilator. She started treatment with medroxyprogesterone, and her respiratory status remained stable. An echocardiogram performed three years later revealed worsening of cardiac condition, enlargement of right cavities and left atrium, and thickening of the aortic valve leaflets; systolic function was preserved.

There was no lymphadenopathy. The lesion was also demonstrated in the small bowel barium study and noted to have a maximum diameter of 5.5 cm ().\nColonoscopy did not show any gross pathology in the colon. The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration that showed a pedunculated mass in the terminal ileum accompanied by intussusception ().\nThirty cm from the ileo cecal vaive including the mass, was surgically removed. The ileocecal valve was preserved. In gross examination the mass was found to be creamy-white in color with a rubbery consistency, measuring 5.5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm with smooth surface and patchy erythema of the covering mucosa.\nCut sections showed homogenous tan cut surfaces. Histological examination of the submucosal mass showed a rather cellular lesion composed principally of bland-looking spindle cells with a collagenous and myxoid background accompanied by various diffusely scattered inflammatory cells, including plasma cells, lymphocytes and eosinophils ().\nNo mitosis, necrosis or hemorrhage was present. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive reactions of the spindle cells for smooth muscle actin, human muscle actin, vimentin and calponin and was negative for ALK-1, desmin, CD34, CD117 (C-kit) and P63. Ki-67 was positive in 5% of the tumor cell nuclei. The final pathologic diagnosis was IMT. What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old Iranian woman, recipient of a living, unrelated renal transplant five years earlier, presented with a productive cough, weight loss and fever. The cause of her end-stage renal disease was chronic pyelonephritis. Six weeks prior to her admission, her immunosuppressant regimen was switched from oral cyclosporine (100 mg, twice daily) to oral sirolimus (1 mg, twice daily) with a diagnosis of chronic allograft nephropathy (serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dL). Her mycophenolate mofetil dose was decreased from 2000 to 1000 mg/day and prednisolone was continued with the previous dose (5 mg, daily). Four weeks later, she developed a mild cough, weakness and anorexia. Her condition progressed to a more constant cough and weight loss until she was hospitalized.\nPhysical examination revealed her blood pressure to be 110/60 mm/Hg, respiratory rate 20/min, pulse rate 92/min and body temperature 38\u00b0C. A chest examination revealed fine crackles mainly on her lower lung fields. On admission, the laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 5.1 \u00d7 109/L, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit 22.4%, mean corpuscular volume 75 fL (normal range, 77-97 fL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin 24 pgm (normal range, 26-32 pgm), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 32% (normal, 32-36%), platelet count 213 \u00d7 109/L, fasting blood glucose 105 mg/dL, blood urea 62 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase 37 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 45 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 1106 IU/L and total bilirubin 1 mg/dL. A urine analysis was unremarkable.\nOn the first day of admission, sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were discontinued and cyclosporine (200 mg/day) was started. The dose of prednisolone was not altered (5 mg, daily). A chest X-ray showed fine miliary nodules throughout the entire lung fields. Echocardiography revealed normal pericardium and cardiac chambers. Her left ventricular ejection fraction was 65%. An ultrasound examination of her renal allograft did not reveal any pathologic finding. A 6 mm induration was observed on a TB skin test. Sputum and bronchial aspirate examination was positive for acid-fast bacilli, suggestive of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan illustrated widespread miliary nodules throughout the lung fields, compatible with miliary TB (Figure ).\nIn the evening of her fourth day of admission, our patient developed an increasing right lower quadrant abdominal pain spreading to her entire abdomen. Physical examination revealed widespread abdominal tenderness and rebound. An ultrasonographic study of her abdomen disclosed a small fluid collection in the right lower quadrant. Two cysts were detected in her left ovary (54 \u00d7 32 mm and 33 \u00d7 31 mm). An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast revealed that her pancreas and spleen were normal. Her colonic wall thickness was measured as 4 mm and free fluid was visible in dependent parts of her abdominal cavity. Her peritoneal cavity was then opened with a midline incision and widespread peritonitis was found. Her inflamed appendix (9 \u00d7 6 cm) was perforated at its tip. Her ileocecal area and cecum were inflamed with fragile tissues. A cecostomy was performed and a drain was placed. Histopathological examination of the resected appendix revealed caseating epithelioid granulomas, epithelioid histiocytes and Langhans giant cells in the sub-mucosa and sub-serosa of her appendix (Figure ). The histological picture, along with positive mycobacterial cultures from the sputum and bronchial aspirate, was suggestive of tuberculous appendicitis. After surgery, chemotherapy for TB was started and continued for nine months. An immunosuppressive regimen was continued with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. During follow-up visits, the pulmonary and abdominal signs and symptoms were resolved. What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?",

    "question": "We present the case of a 52-year-old Mexican man who worked as an office employee and lived in a suburban area of the city of Colima, Mexico. He and his wife denied recent trips outside the city. Zoonosis was absent. He was not physically active and did not have an adequate diet. Pathological antecedents revealed liver cirrhosis, diagnosed 12 years ago, alongside esophageal varices that had been treated with sclerotherapy 7 years prior. He also had a diagnosis of essential hypertension, diagnosed 20 years ago. His treatment prior to hospitalization included 20 mg of propranolol every 12 hours, which was used to treat his essential hypertension, esophageal varices, and to reduce his portal hypertension.\nHe arrived at our institution \u201cIMSS General Hospital Zone 1, Colima\u201d in the early afternoon (day 1, see Table ). He began to experience extreme pain localized in his right foot, 16 to 18 hours prior to admission, with a local pain scale of 10/10. He denied any recent forms of punctures to the overlying skin (including animal and insect bites).\nOn physical examination during admission, he was somnolent, oriented in person and space, but not oriented to time. His vital signs were: arterial pressure (AP, systolic/diastolic) 67/49, mean AP (MAP) 55, heart rate (HR) 88, respiratory rate (RR) 16, and body temperature 36 \u00b0C. He presented hepatopathy facies and spontaneous eyelid opening, his oral mucosa was dry, and his neck showed jugular engorgement grade I. Both hemithorax were slightly hypoventilated with no adventitious sounds. Precordial was rhythmic with low intensity sounds and no murmurs were heard. Peristalsis was present in his abdomen but low in intensity and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. His upper extremities were symmetrical, eutrophic, with no signs of edema; he moved his upper extremities freely without any limitation, no asterixis was present, and a force scale of 4/5 was seen. During exploration of inferior extremities, there was a clear asymmetric pattern. His right lower extremity was volume augmented with signs of edema ++ including large and small bullae formation with serohematogenous liquid inside involving most of his right foot and ankle (Fig. ). The pedal pulse was present but weak and had a local elevated temperature on palpation. His movements were markedly limited due to extreme pain. Deep vein thrombosis maneuvers were performed and were not present. Plantar reflexes were also not seen.\nA peripheral intravenously administered high-dose double scheme of antibiotics (clindamycin plus ceftriaxone), crystalloid fluids, and corticosteroids was initiated. Laboratory studies were performed soon after admission: hemoglobin (Hb) 12.6 g/dl, hematocrit (Htc) 40.3%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 103.9 fL, white blood cells (WBC) 39,400/mm3, neutrophils 37,460/mm3, platelets 104,000/mm3, thrombin time (TT) 26.7 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.15, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 42.8 seconds, glucose 61 g/dL, urea 102.72 mg/dL, creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, total bilirubin (TB) 3.4 mg/dL, direct bilirubin (DB) 2.6 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 1.5 g/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 58 U/L, P 7.1 mEq/L, Ca 8.4 mEq/L, Cl 106 mEq/L, K 6.4 mEq/L, Na 129 mEq/L, Mg 1.72 mEq/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 420 U/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 16.07 mg/L. Correction of hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance was initiated. Deep vein thrombosis was ruled out by clinical assessment and Doppler ultrasound. Aspiration of bulla liquid was obtained and sent to a laboratory for cultivation (positive to Cedecea lapagei, results returned on day 2). Interdisciplinary consultation with angiology was carried out (no indications were added). He was classified with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 11, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II of 22 points (42.4% mortality rate), and a Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score of 11 points (high risk > 75% of having necrotizing fasciitis) [].\nIn the late afternoon (day 1) his somnolence and disorientation persisted, he was hypotensive with an AP of 80/40 with a MAP of 55, and he was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. His hypoglycemia persisted despite vigorous treatment. No fever was present and his skin was pale. His left lower limb had ascending progression of serohematogenous bullae proximal to the patella. His extreme pain continued. Since our patient\u2019s MAP was persistently below 65 mmHg despite intravenously administered fluid therapy, an anterior jugular central venous catheter was placed and we decided to include norepinephrine 8 mg in 0.9% 1000 cc physiological solution passing at a rate of 8 ml/hour, categorizing the case as septic shock []. Concomitantly he had developed acute kidney injury (AKI) \u201cKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes\u201d (KDIGO) stage II.\nDuring the night (day 1), abundant large fetid serohematogenous bullae and edema continued to advance up his right thigh with persistent generalized hypoperfusion. Because of previous mentioned conditions, it was decided to change antibacterial therapy to intravenously administered imipenem and clindamycin. Bullae fluid culture results and antibiogram were not available at that time. Norepinephrine was boosted to maintain MAP above 65 mmHg. Intensive care unit (ICU) was called in for valorization to admit our patient. Unfortunately, due to the lack of space in the ICU, this idea was dismissed. Since rapid deterioration was evident, new laboratory studies were ordered (approximately 10 hours after initial blood test): Hb 10.1 g/dL, Htc 32.7%, MCV 107.5 fL, WBC 11.6/mm3, platelets 35,000/mm3, TT \u201cDoes not coagulate\u201d, PTT \u201cDoes not coagulate\u201d, glucose 30 g/dL, urea 115.5 mg/dL, creatinine 2.4 mg/dL, K 6.4 mEq/L, Na 130 mEq/L, LDH 406 U/L, and CRP 220 mg/L. His SOFA score was 16.\nNecrotizing fasciitis was our primary diagnosis due to clinical and laboratory findings (LRINEC score of 12 points). Even though the diagnosis was very likely, the lack of a biopsy study meant that we could not confirm such a diagnosis. Multiple organ dysfunction secondary to septic shock was also diagnosed. The differential diagnosis of animal or insect bite was dismissed due to lack of exposure history and lack of puncture wound.\nDuring the next morning (day 2) he maintained the same general conditions. Norepinephrine was boosted up again (MAP 50). Soon after, he entered cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed. Unfortunately he died later that morning.

    "question": "A 42-year-old woman presented with acute onset lower limb paralysis associated with severe proximal muscle pain. These symptoms were not associated with respiratory difficulty, dysphagia, dysarthria or sensory symptoms and there was no associated backache, fever, rash or constitutional symptoms. She had a 2 year history of hypertension, which was poorly controlled despite treatment with a combination of nifedipine, atenolol and losartan. She was treated by a general practitioner and at initial diagnosis of hypertension had undergone biochemical evaluation including serum electrolyes, which had been within normal limits. She experienced two similar, but short lasting episodes of weakness in the preceding year, but had not been investigated. Three days prior to admission she had been given Frusemide as add on therapy by her general practitioner due to uncontrolled hypertension. Her blood pressure on admission was 160/100 mmHg. Clinical examination favored an acute onset myopathy with symmetric flaccid paralysis of lower limbs (muscle power - 3/5) with normal muscle power (5/5) in the upper limbs.\nInitial work-up revealed severe hypokalemia (potassium - 2.0 mmol/l) with an elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 11347 IU (16-190) and increased lactic dehydrogenase of 856 IU/l (240-480). Patient's urine was positive for myoglobin with a high urinary myoglobin 4,170 \u03bcg/l. Serum creatinine was 130 \u03bcmol/l. In addition, patient had high urinary potassium of 19.45 mmol/24 h with metabolic alkalosis (pH - 7.540, HCO3-38 mmol/l, base excess - 15 mmol/l and PCO2-44 mmHg).\nThe other biochemical values on initial evaluation were as follows; serum aspartate aminotransferase - 244 IU/l (up to 35 IU/l); alanine aminotransferase - 193 IU/l (2-40); Sodium - 145 mmol/l; blood urea - 45 mg/dl; calcium - 0.9 mmol/l (1.12-1-32); phosphorus - 2.7 mg/dl (2.7-4.5); magnesium - 1.4 mg/dl (1.58-2.55); fasting blood glucose 110 mg/dl and the total protein was 7.6 g/dl with albumin 3.2 g/dl. Thyroid function tests were normal with a free T4 level of 1.02 ng/dl and thyroid-stimulating hormone 3.2 \u03bcIU/ml.\nBased on the above findings, patient was diagnosed as having hypokalemic paralysis and rhabdomyolysis. Treatment was initiated by oral and intravenous supplementation of potassium and after 10 days, muscular strength and CK levels had returned to normal. Conduction studies and electromyography, which were performed after the correction of hypokalemia, were normal.\nThe coexistence of hypertension, hypokalemia with high urinary potassium loss in association with metabolic alkalosis raised the possibility of primary aldosteronism (PA), which lead to further hormonal evaluation. Aldosterone levels were 22,600 ng/dl (normal, 3.6-24.0 ng/dl) and the plasma renin activity (PRA) value was below the detection limit of our method (0.2 ng/ml/h). Aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) was 113,000 ng/ml per ng/ml/h (<10). Abdominal ultrasound did not reveal adrenal lesions, but abdominal computed tomography scan showed a 20 mm \u00d7 16 mm hypodense mass in the medial limb of the right suprarenal gland []. She underwent right sided adrenalectomy and pathological examination of the gland confirmed a 20 mm adrenal adenoma. Post-operatively the patient was normokalemic without spiranolactone and the PRA was 0.52 ng/ml/h; aldosterone was 1.3 ng/dl with a reduced ARR of 2.5 (<20) ng/ml per ng/ml/h. After 4 weeks of discharge, her BP was normal without any antihypertensives and she was normokalemic with normal muscle strength. What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?",

    "question": "This 8-year-old male patient had been suffering from recurrent cough, breathlessness, and malaise since he was 5 years old. He had been administered antibiotics orally for tonsillitis almost every 1-2 months for his complaints. These episodes had been usually associated with fever. He also had a history of five episodes of afebrile convulsions with temporary vision loss. Although laboratory results were negative for tuberculosis, he was administered antituberculosis therapy for one year because of the opacity noted in his chest roentgenogram (). However, he did not respond to the therapy. Also, he had been suffering from polyuria and polydipsia for almost three years. He has been drinking water (6 L/m2/day) and waking up approximately three times to drink and urinate each night.\nAt the time of admission, the patient\u2019s vital functions were within normal ranges. Physical examination revealed a thin child who weighed 23 kg (15th percentile) and measured 115 cm in height (30th percentile) but appeared to be healthy. His oral mucosa was dry and breath sounds were reduced on the left side. Other physical findings were normal including the neurological system.\nLaboratory results showed a hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dL, a total leucocyte count of 10.800/mm3, and a differential count within normal ranges. While the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (38 mg/L) were elevated, the electrolytes, serum calcium, uric acid, as well as renal and liver functions were within normal ranges. Basal serum sodium, urea, and glucose levels were also within normal ranges (142 meq/L, 11 mg/dL, and 96 mg/dL, respectively). Before the water deprivation test, urine specific gravity, serum and urine osmolarity values were 1,000, 293 mOsm/kg, and 133 mOsm/kg, respectively. Following a 14-hour period of water deprivation, the serum sodium level increased to 155 meq/L and urine specific gravity, serum and urine osmolality were found as 1,007, 323 mOsm/kg and 240 mOsm/kg, respectively. Serum antidiuretic hormone was <0.5 pg/mL both before and after the water deprivation test and these levels were consistent with cDI. Polyuria and polydipsia symptoms were relieved with desmopressin. The pituitary hormone profile was in normal ranges except for a low level of insulin-like growth factor of 79 ng/dL (-2/-3 SDS) and antidiuretic hormone. CNS investigation revealed presence of two 10- and 14-mm lesions on the left parietal and temporo-occipital lobes and a small adenohypophysis (2 mm in diameter). The infundibulum was normal in appearance, but neurohypophysis intensity was decreased (, ).\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest showed a large lobulated calcified mass (, ). The lung biopsy gave no morphological clues of malignancy, such as increased and/or abnormal mitotic activity, conspicuous cellular atypia, or necrosis (). Immunohistochemically, the proliferating cells were highlighted with vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and muscle-specific actin. Focal and weak immunoreactivity against desmin was also noted in some areas. There was no nuclear staining with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). These morphological findings were interpreted to be in favor of IMT. Later, a thorough examination of the resection material also confirmed the diagnosis of IMT.\nClinical and pathological findings suggested IMT. The mass was excised with an incision extending from the diaphragm to the pericardium, and the invaded part in the atrium was trimmed. After an uneventful pneumonectomy, the patient was discharged. Corticosteroid or chemotherapy was not considered because of the unclear benefits. Three months after pneumonectomy, the patient\u2019s acute phase reactants decreased to normal levels and the febrile episodes diminished, due to resection of the inflammatory focus. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance scan performed three months after the pneumonectomy showed findings similar to the former magnetic resonance image, with two well-defined round lesions with perifocal edema.\nCurrently, the patient is being followed with regard to his growth velocity, potential adenohypophysis hormone deficiency, as well as with regard to cerebral lesions.

    "question": "In the 1998 report on the treatment of B, he was 20 years old. B had been a child with a classical gender dysphoric development and fulfilled the current criteria for GnRH analog treatment eligibility. He was interviewed shortly after his legal gender change. This meant that he had had puberty suppression, cross-sex hormone treatment, a mastectomy, ovariectomy, and uterus extirpation. From his assessment during the diagnostic phase, he appeared to be an intelligent person (IQ = 128) with excellent problem-solving capabilities with respect to emotional matters. Vulnerable aspects of his psychological functioning were his insecurity about himself and moderately depressed feelings. In all other areas, his scores on a broad range of measures were in the average range, as compared to Dutch normative samples. Shame concerning his transsexualism made him highly selective in his friendships and guarded in his contacts with new people. At the assessment, 1 year after his ovariectomy but prior to his metaidoioplasty, he no longer reported feelings of gender dysphoria. He had adjusted easily to the male role and expressed no doubts on the adequacy of his masculine behavior. After the development of his secondary male sex characteristics, nobody had ever approached him as a woman. He never felt any regrets about his decision and had never contemplated living as a girl again. Knowing what gender reassignment implied, he would do it all over again. B was happy with his life and did not feel lonely. He showed a significant pre-post treatment decrease in his feelings of inadequacy. At the time, he was attending medical school.\nB attended the pediatric endocrinology clinic for the first time when he was age 13.7 years. His medical history was uneventful. Puberty had started 1\u20132 years previously, but menarche had not occurred. On physical examination, a healthy girl was seen with a height of 157.3 cm and a Tanner pubertal stage of B3, P3. Bone age according to Tanner and Whitehouse was 13.5 years. Target height, as a female, was estimated at 171 cm, based on the parental height. Puberty suppression was induced by the GnRH analog Triptorelin, in a dose of 3.75 mg every 4 weeks intramuscularly. On this dosage, B steadily kept on growing.\nAt age 18.6 years, his height was 165.8 cm. Induction of male puberty and accompanying secondary male sex characteristics was initiated by administration of 100 mg testosterone-ester mixture intramuscularly every 2 weeks. This was, after 6 months, increased to 250 mg testosterone-ester mixture, every 2\u20133 weeks intramuscularly. At the start of the androgen treatment, the Triptorelin treatment was discontinued.\nWhen B was 20 years old, he had a subcutaneous mastectomy by way of an infra-areolar approach, a few months later followed by a hysterectomy and gonadectomy. Two years later, metaidoioplasty and testes implantation were performed.\nFifteen years after the first interview and testing session, at age 35, B was seen again at the clinic. He lived on his own and he worked as a family doctor in private practice with two colleagues. All family members knew about his transitioning as did some of his friends. He was very satisfied about his circle of friends and had never been treated negatively because of his transsexualism.\nB was still satisfied about his (minor) breast surgery, his ovariectomy, and his hysterectomy, but no longer about the metaidoioplasty he underwent one year after the first follow-up session. He did not like its size and shape and he could hardly urinate in a standing position. He was able to have orgasms, but he could not have sexual intercourse. Because of his desire to have more convincingly male appearing external genitals and his wish to be able urinate in a standing position, he considered having a phalloplasty. Despite his good looks and very masculine appearance, he had not had many steady girlfriends, which may have resulted from the guardedness he already had as an adolescent. At age 29, he had a serious relationship with a woman, which lasted for 5 years. However, he chose not to live together when the opportunity to do so arose. After his choice to continue living apart, his girlfriend ended the relationship, a few months before his interview at the clinic. This made him very much regret his lack of commitment. B considered it likely that his need to distance himself from her had been related to his shame about his genital appearance and his feelings of inadequacy in sexual matters. Additional factors, such as serious illness of his father and a suicide among his sisters\u2019 in-laws, made him rather sad at the time of the interview. Although his psychoneuroticism score on the Symptom Checklist-90 (Arrindell & Ettema, ) was in the normal range, his depression subscore was high, indicating depressed feelings. However, on the Beck Depression Inventory, he scored in the \u201cminimal range\u201d (van der Does, ), indicating that he did not fulfill criteria for clinical depression. On the Adult Self-Report, assessing adaptive functioning and problems in adults aged 18-59 years (Achenbach & Rescorla, ), all his scores were in the normal range.\nIt seems, therefore, that B functioned well in most aspects of life, but that he was still struggling with the question, how to handle the dissatisfaction and shame about his genital appearance.\nAt age 35, on physical examination, we saw a healthy and well virilized person. Blood pressure was 120/85 mmHg, final height was 169.5 cm and weight was 73 kg, which resulted in a body mass index (BMI) of 25.4 kg/m2. Sitting height was 88 cm. Skull circumference was 55.5 cm. For a comparison of his anthropometrical measurements to the normal reference values of Dutch males and females, see Table .\nA fasting venous blood sample was drawn. General health markers, like hematological parameters (Hb, ht, erythrocytes), renal function, and liver enzymes, were all within the normal reference value ranges. His lipid profile showed a total cholesterol level of 228.3 mg/dl (<251.5 mg/dl), LDL-cholesterol 154.8 mg/dl (<193.5 mg/dl), HDL-cholesterol 55.0 mg/dl (>34.8 mg/dl), and triglycerides 97.4 mg/dl (<177 mg/dl). His glucose value was 97.3 mg/dl (<144.1 mmol/l) with an insulin level of 21 pmol/l (12\u201396 pmol/l for a fasting sample). His HbA1c was 5.4% (4.3\u20136.1%). These values were in the normal range.\nWith respect to the gonadal axis, a normal-low serum testosterone level of 236.6 ng/dl (231\u2013866 ng/dl) was found. This relatively low level was probably due to the fact that the blood sample was taken just before the next testosterone-ester mixture injection. Gonadotropins were elevated as a consequence of the gonadectomy. LH and FSH were 16 U/l and 50 U/l, respectively. Additionally determined endocrine parameters, such as thyroid and adrenal function, were all within normal reference ranges.\nWith respect to bone mineral density (BMD), a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was performed to determine B\u2019s BMD in the lumbar spine, the non-dominant hip, and (further) total body. The observed values were related to the bone peak mass for white females and for white males, resulting in T-scores. For all values, the z-score was determined as well (see Table ).

    "question": "A six-year-old female presented to a small rural ED with her mother for a four-day history of sore throat and fever. Fever at home was reported as high as 102 degrees Fahrenheit. The mother had been treating her child\u2019s symptoms with over-the-counter acetaminophen and cold medicine. There was additional report of ear pain and a mild cough. There were no complaints of abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or rash. Immunizations were reported as up to date. The patient had recently been seen by her pediatrician and had a rapid strep screen that was negative. There was no significant past medical history, surgical history, or allergies. The child took no scheduled medications at home. Reviews of systems were negative.\nOn initial presentation, triaged vitals were temperature 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 112 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure 97/72 mmHg. The child was awake, alert, and interactive. On exam, no significant posterior pharyngeal erythema or tonsillar exudates were noted. Bilateral ear canals were patent with no tympanic membrane abnormalities. There were no other noteworthy physical exam findings. Based on the history and physical exam, the patient\u2019s pharynx was re-swabbed for rapid strep and she was given ibuprofen for her fever. The rapid strep throat screen resulted negative. She was diagnosed with viral pharyngitis and was discharged home with follow-up with her pediatrician in two days.\nSix days later the patient presented a second time. This time the chief complaint was worsening sore throat and swollen hard neck. Temperature on arrival was 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 156 bpm, blood pressure 112/83 mmHg, and respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. Pertinent exam findings were anterior neck that was firm and with fullness with palpation. Diffuse cervical lymphadenopathy was present. Patient was able to flex and extend her neck normally. No tonsillar exudates or erythema noted. Tympanic membranes were clear with patent canals bilaterally. Another rapid strep screen and culture were collected and recorded as negative. Radiographs of the chest and soft tissue of the neck were read by radiology as no acute findings. A mono-spot test resulted negative. Complete blood count (CBC) showed white blood cells (WBC) 19.1 K/uL; high end of assay was 11,000 K/uL. The patient was diagnosed with pharyngitis and was administered dexamethasone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. She was discharged to home with a prescription for amoxicillin/clavulanate and prednisolone and directed to follow up with her pediatrician.\nSeveral hours later the attending emergency physician contacted the family to inquire how the child was doing post discharge. When the mother reported that her child was vomiting, she was told to return to the ED. A third time to the ED, seven hours after recent discharge, the patient presented clammy and diaphoretic. Heart rate was 58bpm, blood pressure 123/61 mmHg, temperature 97.9, and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. CBC showed WBC 21.1 K/uL. Basic metabolic panel was within normal limits of assay, as was a urinalysis. Anti-streptolysin-O blood test was reported as negative. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was ordered and reported as undetectable and free T4 2.29 NG/DL elevated for this assay.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the soft tissue of the neck was completed and read by radiology as multiloculated heterogeneous fluid and presence of a soft tissue lesion in the left thyroid lobe measuring 2.8 \u00d7 3.5cm in axial cross-section and about five centimeters in craniocaudal dimension ( and ). Findings were most compatible with acute suppurative thyroiditis. What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "An 81-year-old Asian man presented to our department complaining of fever since the preceding day. The patient had been under treatment for the previous 3 years for chronic heart failure and chronic renal failure. He did not have a history of malignancy, diabetes mellitus, cytotoxic therapy, or corticosteroid use, and no foreign bodies had been implanted. The patient\u2019s family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 101 beats/min, blood pressure of 87/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, temperature of 37.0 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. He had no caries or periodontitis. Results of respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Limb examination demonstrated mild edema of both legs. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a low-density mass in the right iliopsoas muscle indicative of an iliopsoas abscess (Fig. ). The patient\u2019s white blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin levels were 19,400/\u03bcl, 13.35 mg/dl, and 3.950 ng/ml, respectively. Serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were elevated at 77.2 mg/dl and 3.69 mg/dl, respectively. A CT-guided percutaneous drainage of the psoas abscess was performed, and an indwelling catheter was placed. Gram staining of the drained fluid revealed many neutrophils and Gram-positive streptococci. On the basis of these findings, a presumptive diagnosis of iliopsoas abscess caused by Streptococcus species was made, and treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) 1.5 g, administered intravenously every 8 h, was initiated. Results of organism cultures of the abscess and blood were positive, and P. micra was identified by using the API ZYM system (Sysmex-bioM\u00e9rieux Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), with the organism exhibiting susceptibility to penicillin G, ampicillin, clindamycin, and meropenem. By day 7, the patient\u2019s white blood cell count normalized. By day 20, his CRP level was decreased to 0.35 mg/dl. Therefore, the pigtail catheter was removed. The patient died of peritonitis due to colon diverticulum perforation after 5 weeks of treatment.

    "question": "A 29-years-old female experienced an episode of mild upper respiratory tract infection followed by a slowly developing dysphagia and dyspnea. This led to impaired exercise tolerance lasting several months, with recent subacute exacerbation. There was no significant history of travel or exposure to infectious agents. She had not suffered from fever or other acute or chronic infectious symptoms. Her palatine tonsils had been removed in childhood. She was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 17 and had been free of epileptic symptoms for over 5 years with levetiracetam (500 mg two times per day) and lamotrigine (150 mg two times per day). Her family history was unremarkable.\nShe spoke with hoarse voice, without signs or findings that would have suggested systemic involvement. There were no signs of generalized mucosal disease. Fiberoptic examination showed swelling of the lingual tonsil, epiglottic and arytenoid mucosa, causing airway obstruction (Fig. a). C-reactive protein concentration and blood sedimentation rate were low, and anti-nuclear, anti-neutrophil, anti-glomerular basement membrane, anti-myeloperoxidase, anti-proteinase 3, tissue transglutaminase and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Thyroid function was normal and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were 34 IU/ml (normal value < 60 IU/ml). Plasma parathyroid hormone (39 ng/l; normal 18\u201380 ng/l) and serum vitamin D-25 (77 nmol/l; normal > 50 nmol/l) were normal. No evidence for acute or chronic viral, bacterial, mycobacterial or fungal infections, including hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and tularemia, was found.\nDue to her swollen lingual tonsil and laryngeal mucosa causing airway obstruction, she was hospitalized and received empiric cefuroxime (1.5 g thrice daily) and methylprednisolone (75 mg once daily, height 173 cm, weight 63 kg, prednisolone dose 1.2 mg/kg) intravenously. After a transient positive response, she was discharged from the hospital after 6 days. Soon after, she was readmitted to due to a rapid reoccurrence of the symptoms. A modest positive response was seen after per oral clindamycin and oral prednisolone (60 mg/days) with dose reduction for 14 days. Lingual tonsil and epiglottis were biopsied. Histology showed granulomatous reaction in lingual tonsil with CD68+ (Kp-1) epithelioid histiocytes (Fig. ). The CD20+ B lymphocyte count was increased while Pax-5+ positive B lymphocyte count was normal. CD138+ plasma cells were scarce, and they showed polytypic kappa- and lambda light chain expression. The number of CD3+ T cells was normal, and most T cells were CD4+. Eosinophils were practically absent and well-formed follicles were not seen. Epstein\u2013Barr virus in situ hybridization (EBER), p16, cytomegalovirus and mycobacteria were negative. Morphology, immunohistochemical staining, serum electrophoresis and bone marrow aspirate did not raise suspicion of lymphoid neoplasia, thus, no clonality studies were done.\nDue to granulomas, sarcoidosis was considered. However, chest X-ray, computerized tomography of chest and ultrasound of neck and abdomen were unremarkable. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the lingual tonsil, without evidence of widespread sarcoidosis (Fig. ). No other pathological FDG foci were found. Focal physiological FDG accumulation was seen in ureters on both sides of the spinal column. This is a common finding due to ureteral peristalsis and pooling of radiotracer in the recumbent patient. The patient had no neurological symptoms and brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was within normal range (11\u201320 U/l; reference range 9\u201365 U/l) while daily urine calcium output was normal or slightly elevated (5.0\u20136.31 mmol; reference range 1.2\u20135.5 mmol).\nSubsequently, an unusual presentation of primary or secondary immunodeficiency was considered. There was no consanguinity; the patient or her family had no history of repeated infections or autoimmunity. White cell, lymphocyte, and B, T and NK lymphocyte subset counts were within normal limits. CD19+ B cell count was 153 \u00d7 109/l (normal range 80\u2013616 \u00d7 109/l). Proportions of memory CD27+ B-cells (30.3%) and IgD\u2212IgM\u2212CD27+ switched memory B cells 7.2%; (normal range 6.5\u201329.2%) were normal and the percentage of activated CD21low B cells was high (6.6%; normal range 0.6\u20133.5%). Percentages of various CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cell subsets appeared normal. Serum total IgG (3.5 g/l; normal range 6.77\u201315.0 g/l) and all IgG subclass concentrations were low: IgG1 2.45 g/l (normal range 4.9\u201311.4 g/l), IgG2 0.91 g/l (normal range 1.5\u20136.4 g/l), IgG3 0.18 g/l (normal range 0.2\u20131.1 g/l) and IgG4 0.02 g/L (normal range 0.08\u20131.4 g/l). Anti-polysaccharide response to Pneumovax\u00ae were impaired, with only 3/10 serotypes reaching a level of 0.35 \u00b5g/ml after immunization. However, serum IgA (0.90 g/l; normal range 0.52\u20134.02 g/l) and IgM concentrations (0.57 g/l; normal range 0.47\u20132.84 g/l) were normal. Dihydrorhodamine test excluded chronic granulomatous disease. These findings were thus consistent with either granulomatous CVID or most likely secondary drug-induced hypogammaglobulinemia with a novel clinical presentation [\u2013]. Genetic analysis (Blueprint Genetics, Primary Immunodeficiency Plus panel. ) did not find known mutations causative of CVID-like or other primary immunodeficiencies.\nDue to symptomatic upper airway obstruction, dysphagia, lack of evident infection and unsatisfactory response to prednisolone treatment and possible granulomatous CVID, the patient received immunoglobulin replacement and rituximab therapy (Mabthera\u00ae 100 mg, 200 mg and 500 mg on three consecutive days combined with 100 mg hydrocortisone and 1 g paracetamol), with a favorable response within 2 weeks accompanied by significant improvement in dysphagia and respiratory symptoms. Seven months later, her exercise capacity was good. She has remained asymptomatic for over 16 months after rituximab treatment. Her fiberoptic pharyngeal findings improved (Fig. ). She continues to receive subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement with serum IgG levels in the range of 10 to 12 g/l. What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "A 63-year-old Caucasian man presented to our hospital with 2 weeks of progressive generalized weakness, vague abdominal discomfort, and dyspnea on exertion requiring more frequent use of his inhaler. He did not report similar symptoms in the past, and he denied any associated chest pain, cough, changes in bowel habits, fevers, chills, weight loss, recent travel, tick bites, or sick contacts. His past medical history was relevant for chronic bronchitis diagnosed 10 years ago. He was a former one-pack-per-day smoker for 20 years. His family history was noncontributory.\nThe patient\u2019s vital signs at presentation showed a blood pressure of 128/84 mmHg, heart rate of 75 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and body temperature of 97.7 \u00b0F. On physical examination, the patient was in no apparent distress and was awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. His heart and lung examination revealed sinus tachycardia and diffuse expiratory wheezes throughout the lung fields. The patient\u2019s abdominal examination was pertinent for a nonperitonitic tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. His neurological examination was remarkable for weakness in the right upper extremity. His laboratory data are summarized in Table .\nSee Fig. for the timeline of the patient\u2019s kidney function and absolute eosinophil count while receiving steroid treatment.\nFindings of computed tomography (CT) of the patient\u2019s brain were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain revealed subacute infarcts involving the left frontal white matter and left cerebellum; in addition, an evolving subacute infarct was seen in the left corona radiata. CT of the chest demonstrated diffuse ground-glass opacity, and CT of the abdomen was remarkable for a wedge-shaped area of low attenuation in the spleen consistent with splenic infarct. His transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a mural apical thrombus in the left ventricular (LV) apex with reduced ejection fraction (31\u201335%). Cardiac MRI performed 7 days after anticoagulation therapy was initiated showed a diffuse subendocardial scarring of the middle to apical LV segments and the right ventricular side of the septum. It also revealed evidence of edema of the middle anteroseptum and apical septum, consistent with endomyocardial fibrosis. However, no mural thrombus was visualized.\nA presumptive diagnosis of HES was made on the basis of presenting symptoms, laboratory data, and imaging studies. Investigation for secondary causes, including immunological testing (Table ), blood and urine cultures, ova and parasites, and infectious serology (Table ), were unrevealing, and results of urine drug screening were negative. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a normocellular bone marrow population with eosinophilia comprising 60\u201370%, without evidence of lymphoproliferative disorder or metastatic neoplasm. Cytogenetic analysis was unrevealing: negative for breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR-ABL1) fusion, eosinophilia-associated platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation, and JAK2 pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1) fusion.\nDue to the stigma of hemolysis (normocytic acute anemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin, positive schistocytes with relative thrombocytopenia), further investigation was pursued. The result of the Coombs test (direct and indirect) was negative. A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13 (ADAMTS13) activity level was greater than 50%, and the expression of complement regulatory proteins CD59 and CD55 on erythrocytes was within normal limits as determined by flow cytometry.\nDue to a further decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) early in the patient\u2019s hospital course, a kidney biopsy was pursued. Renal biopsy revealed a glomerular and vascular TMA, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation with focal eosinophils (Fig. ). IHC staining for eosinophil granule major basic protein 1 (MBP1) was not performed.\nOur patient was started on prednisone 1 mg/kg daily and a heparin protocol at 18 U/kg/hour with an activated partial thromboplastin time goal of 60\u2013100 seconds. Simultaneously, warfarin was initiated. Once the patient\u2019s international normalized ratio was within therapeutic range (2.0\u20133.0), he was anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin for an additional 48 hours. His eosinophil count and estimated GFR were monitored on an outpatient basis, and his prednisone dose was gradually tapered. After the eighth week, the patient was maintained on 5 mg of prednisone daily.\nBy the time the renal biopsy report was available, the patient\u2019s kidney function had started to recover; hence, no further intervention was required. After initiation of treatment with steroids, the patient achieved resolution of pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, and abdominal symptoms. Repeat echocardiography after 5 weeks showed improvement of LV ejection fraction to 50\u201355%. Complete normalization of eosinophil count and renal function was observed after 4 and 8 weeks of therapy, respectively (Fig. ). At his 10-week follow-up, the patient continued to do well under close surveillance for renal and cardiac complications. At 12-month follow-up, he continued to have a normal eosinophil count and renal function. However, cardiac MRI showed persistent endocardial fibrosis. What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "A 72-year-old male attended the otorhinolaryngology outpatient department with complaints of right ear discharge over 2 years. He had no other constitutional symptoms. The patient had undergone left side myringoplasty 5 years previously for chronic suppurative otitis media. His chronic ear discharge was not resolved after ear surgery. The ear discharge was sent for bacterial culture which showed no growth. The patient was taking topical ciprofloxacin ear drops, without any resolution of the symptoms.\nOn examination of the ear, it revealed mild myringitis, thickening of the posterior ear canal, and active purulent discharge. There was some pinkish-to-pale colored granulation tissue at the posterosuperior quadrant of the tympanic membrane ().\nThe tympanic membrane was intact. The patient was concerned about malignancy and we took tissue from the granulations at the ear canal and sent it for histopathological examination. Histopathological examination showed squamous epithelium with granulo- matous inflammation. The acid-fast bacilli stain was positive for acid-fast bacilli ().\nThere were no fungal hyphae on Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver stain and no evidence of any malignancy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was positive for Myco-bacterium tuberculosis, which was surprising.\nThe patient was then properly evaluated by chest physicians, and denied any fever, cough, weight loss, or hemoptysis. He had no past history of exposure to tuberculosis. The patient\u2019s routine laboratory findings including complete blood count, liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum creatinine were normal. However, QuantiFERON-TB Gold was positive. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the both sides of the temporal bone was performed, which showed narrowing of the left external auditory canal ().\nThis lesion was treated for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, including rifampicin (600 mg daily), isoniazid (300 mg daily), pyrazinamide (2,000 mg) daily, and ethambutol (1600 mg) daily for 2 months. The isoniazid and rifampicin were continued for the next 8 months. The patient\u2019s otorrhea was resolved within 1 month after starting the antitubercular therapy (ATT).

His past surgical history included a recent dental procedure with a dental implant placement.\nOn examination, his temperature was 39.3 degree Celsius, blood pressure was 137/89 mmHg, heart rate was 99 beats/min. Cardiovascular system and respiratory system were unremarkable. Laboratory findings showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 3600/mm3, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL with a hematocrit of 36.3%, and platelet count of 45000/mm3. The baseline platelet count of the patient was 90000/mm3. Chest X-ray (as shown in Figure ), respiratory panel, and urinalysis were negative for infection. Blood cultures did not show any growth. CT maxillofacial without contrast showed metallic implant in the left maxillary tooth and moderate to severe paranasal sinusitis (as shown in Figure ). The patient was diagnosed with sepsis secondary to transient bacteremia secondary to dental procedure versus sinusitis and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nThe patient improved clinically with antibiotics and the signs of active infection resolved. However, his platelet count continued to worsen with a nadir of 25000/mm3. Hematology was consulted and the peripheral blood smear was reviewed which was unremarkable with no hemolysis. Other causes of thrombocytopenia such as infection with HIV, hepatitis C, autoimmune panel, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were ruled out. Of note, the patient had a bone marrow biopsy nine months before presentation which showed 5.6% plasma cells without evidence of clonality and high-normal number of megakaryocytes with thrombocytopenia consistent with peripheral destruction or sequestration confirming his previous diagnosis of chronic ITP. A presumptive diagnosis of acute on chronic ITP was made. He was started on IV immunoglobulins 1 mg/kg of ideal body weight before considering an immunosuppressant in a patient with infection and there was an improvement in platelet counts from 25000/mm3 to 41000/mm3.

    "question": "The patient was an 82-year-old female who is a nursing home resident presented to an outside hospital with a two-week history of jaundice that had progressively worsened. She was brought to the emergency department and found to have hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin of 10.7 and a direct bilirubin of 8.7. She was afebrile, and white blood cell count was 8.9. A CT scan of her abdomen and a MRCP were diagnostic for Mirizzi syndrome, revealing large stones compressing the common bile duct (CBD) with proximal dilation. She was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of care with hepato-pancreatico-biliary surgeons. Of note, her past medical history was significant for morbid obesity with a BMI of 42, dementia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), depression, anemia, tobacco use, and congestive heart failure (CHF). Her surgical history consisted of an appendectomy.\nUpon arrival at our hospital, the patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with the removal of small stones in the common bile duct, sphincterotomy, and two stent placements with ends terminating in the distal right and left hepatic ducts. However, despite this, there was still tapering in the common hepatic and common bile ducts noted from extrinsic compression from the large stones in the gallbladder and a significant filling defect through the cystic duct (). Additionally, the patient developed a fever and leukocytosis and persistently elevated bilirubin, with the most likely cause being an obstruction of the biliary stents causing persistent cholangitis and cholecystitis. The ERCP was repeated, and a third stent was placed. The patient's fever was controlled, and the bilirubin began to trend down.\nOnce the patient was stabilized, she was taken to the operating room for a cholecystectomy. The procedure began laparoscopically, but dense adhesions in the right upper quadrant involving the liver, gall bladder, omentum, and transverse colon prevented the development of adequate and safe dissection planes, and thus, the procedure was converted to open. The lysis of adhesions continued to be difficult, but once the gallbladder was dissected out, two large, firm masses were palpated within the fundus and the neck of the gallbladder. Given the difficulty with the anatomy to safely do a cholecystectomy with the gallstones en bloc, the decision was made at this time to do a partial cholecystectomy with the removal of the stones. The anterior gallbladder wall was first opened near the fundus, and the gallbladder wall was first dissected off the stone and then the stone from the posterior wall. When removed, the stone measured approximately 3.5 centimeters (), and pus and necrotic tissue were found within the gallbladder.\nAttention was then turned to the neck of the gallbladder where the anterior wall of the gallbladder was again incised, revealing another a large 4-centimeter stone () that was dissected off the posterior wall and removed. It was noted at this time that there was significant arterial bleeding with a loss of approximately 300 cc of blood and the development of mild hypotension and tachycardia. Given the new symptoms and the patient's baseline hemoglobin of 8.4, the patient received two units of red blood cells intraoperatively. The arterial bleeding was controlled with sutures, and attention was turned to the biliary tree upon which a defect in the common hepatic duct and the common bile duct was noted, presumably where the cystic duct previously entered and from the cholecystocholedochal fistula formation. The defect measured approximately three centimeters in length and eight millimeters in width after debridement of necrotic tissue.\nGiven the fragility of the tissue and the size of CBD defect, it was not closed primarily. However, the patient's hemodynamic instability and overall health status made a biliary-enteric anastomosis a very high-risk operation with significant morbidity and mortality for the patient. Thus, the decision was made to use a dissected, viable gallbladder wall piece to form a free flap to repair the defect in the biliary tree (). The mucosal surface of the gall bladder wall was juxtaposed to the lumen of the common ducts and secured in place with a running 5-0 PDS suture. The remnant gallbladder stump was closed and oversewn in a continuous fashion. The area was extensively irrigated given the pus and necrosis that was discovered during the cholecystectomy. One drain was placed within the closed gallbladder remnant and the second one outside the closed gallbladder remnant. The abdomen was then closed in the usual manner.\nImmediately, postoperatively, the patient was managed in the intensive care unit given her instability during the operation but was transferred to a step down unit shortly after on postoperative day two. She was observed off of antibiotics with normalization of leukocytosis, remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable, and had continuously down trending bilirubin levels throughout the remainder of her hospital stay. Clinically, she recovered well and was stable for discharge on postoperative day seven with drains remaining in place and to be removed on a follow-up as an outpatient. On a subsequent follow-up, the patient was noted to remain clinically stable and follow-up CT scans revealed no intrahepatic biliary duct dilation, a normal caliber common bile duct, no intraluminal filling defect, a patent stent, and no biliary leak (). Laboratory evaluation revealed no leukocytosis and normalization of liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels. Given these results, her surgical drains were removed, but her biliary stents remained in place, and despite multiple contact points and counseling to have a follow-up with the gastroenterologists for ERCP and removal, she was noncompliant and the stents remain in place to date. She however remains stable and healthy during her one follow-up appointment as of this writing and continues to be monitored closely with phone check-ins with no evidence of further hepatobiliary symptoms or complaints of incisional hernias.

In each previous visit, the patient received penicillin as the antibiotic for the treatment, and the clinical problem was resolved, but the recurrence occurred within a few weeks.\nThe patient consulted with the physician in charge, who is a family physician, and gave the history that she was a prostitute and has to perform oral sexual intercourse with many different males. Nevertheless, she has no history of sexually transmitted infection, and her annual blood check, according to the legal regulation for the prostitute, for HIV serology and VDRL was negative. Furthermore, her annual gynecological examination result is within the normal limit. The differential diagnosis of recurrent tonsillitis in this patient is Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes infection that requires microbiological examination for discrimination. In this case, the tonsil and throat swab were done, and the microbiological study revealed gonorrhea infection. The patient was treated with dual-therapy regimen with single-dose ceftriaxone intramuscular injection and single dose 1 g oral azithromycin according to the 2015 STDs Treatment Guidelines of CDC (). Her clinical symptoms disappeared within 1 week. In this case, health education on safe sex was also given to the patient. However, the patient lost follow-up, and it cannot verify the success and impact of health education. Whether there is any impact on her profession, a prostitute is still questionable.

    "question": "A 37-year-old Indian woman presented to our university based, academic emergency department, with a chief complaint of fever of one-week duration. The patient reported the fever was persistent and fluctuated between 102 and 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The elevated temperatures were associated with shaking chills and diffuse myalgias. Review of systems was otherwise unremarkable. She denied any recent change in her appetite or weight.\nThe patient had a past medical history significant for Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE) that was diagnosed at age 16. She received a cadaveric renal transplant ten years prior to admission secondary to Lupus nephropathy. Over the past year, the patient had suffered from chronic rejection and was on the renal transplant list for a second time. Additional past medical history includes hypertension, chronic Molluscum contagiosum on the lower extremities, thyroid cancer status post total thyroidectomy, and renal cell carcinoma status post right native nephrectomy.\nMedications included tacrolimus 2 milligrams twice daily, prednisone 5 milligrams daily, darbepoetin alfa 60 milligrams subcutaneously weekly, atenolol 25 milligrams daily, amlodipine 5 milligrams daily, calcitriol 0.25 micrograms daily, levothyroxine 100 micrograms daily, iron supplementation, and a daily multivitamin. Mycophenolate mofetil was recently stopped secondary to epistaxis and gingival bleeding. The patient denied any known drug allergies and was not taking any over the counter medications.\nThe patient denied any recent travel history but did report spending fourteen days in Nicaragua approximately nine months prior to presentation. While in Nicaragua, the patient recalled a transient diarrheal illness that resolved without incident. The patient denied a history of smoking, alcohol use, illegal drug use, or high-risk sexual behavior.\nOn physical examination, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time and in no acute distress. The patient\u2019s vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 112/81, heart rate 115, respiratory rate 16, oral temperature 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, oxygen saturation on room air 97 percent. The remainder of the patient\u2019s physical examination was unremarkable except for the skin, which was warm, dry, and with numerous 2-5 millimeter pearly, flesh-colored, umbilicated papules on the lower extremities consistent with Molluscum contagiosum.\nInitial laboratory studies () were significant for a relative monocytosis, normochromic normocytic anemia, increased lactate dehydrogenase with normal Coombs test, thrombocytopenia, high indirect bilirubin, hyponatremia, metabolic acidemia, and renal failure. The patient reported her creatinine was recently measured to be approximately 2.4. It was 3.7 in the emergency department at presentation. A urine analysis was performed and found to contain 1+ blood; however, microscopic analysis failed to reveal any erythrocytes. The patient\u2019s initial chest radiograph was negative for any acute disease process. A blood smear was obtained (). Numerous ring trophozites measuring approximately 2.0 microns were seen and estimated to involve 3.8 percent of the erythrocytes. The infected erythrocytes appeared the same size as the surrounding, non-infected cells. No other inclusions, with the exception of the pyroplasms, were seen in the erythrocytes. A rapid malaria antigen test was performed and found to be negative.\nAt this point, the patient was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of Babesiosis. The patient was started on azithromycin 250 milligrams daily, doxycycline 100 milligrams twice daily, and atovaquone 750 milligrams twice daily. On hospital day two, additional data was obtained about the patient\u2019s hematologic status. The patient was found to have a reticulocyte count of 1.32 (an inadequate bone marrow response most likely secondary to chronic renal failure), a haptoglobin level less than 7, and a falling hemoglobin level. In the setting of increased red cell destruction and decreased red cell production, the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells. The patient responded well to the transfusions and her hemoglobin subsequently stabilized while her lactate dehydrogenase and haptoglobin improved only marginally.\nWhile the patient\u2019s hemoglobin initially dropped, the patient\u2019s renal function steadily improved with treatment of her underlying infection. By the end of the patient\u2019s one-week hospital stay, her creatinine had returned to baseline. In addition, her bilirubin, electrolytes, white blood cell count, and platelet count improved over the week.\nThe diagnosis of Babesiosis was eventually confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed by Focus Diagnostics Incorporated in Cypress, California. In addition, a diagnosis of Lyme disease was presumed secondary to elevated Lyme titers and high rate of concurrent infection of Babesiosis with Lyme disease. Our patient did extremely well and was discharged home with no residual symptoms. What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "A 65-year-old male marathon runner presented to a primary care physician with abrupt onset of posterior left knee pain that began two days before. There had been no injury associated with the pain. He denied systemic symptoms, including fever, chills, night sweats, or malaise. Past medical history included asymptomatic severe mitral valve regurgitation secondary to bileaflet mitral valve prolapse, for which he underwent robot-assisted minimally invasive mitral valve repair and prosthetic ring placement approximately 6 months prior to presentation. There was also a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He lived in the central United States with his wife and was employed as an attorney. He consumed approximately two alcoholic drinks per night, was a never smoker, and had no history of intravenous drug use. There were no other significant exposures or travel documented.\nThe patient recovered from his mitral valve repair, had stopped anticoagulation after 6 weeks, and had returned to walking and/or running 3\u20135 miles per day. A transthoracic echocardiogram that was done approximately 2 months postoperatively demonstrated a normal functioning valve, with only trace regurgitation.\nHe was initially treated with symptomatic pain relief with hydrocodone-acetaminophen but had no improvement in the left popliteal fossa pain and was therefore referred to an orthopedic provider. A plain radiograph demonstrated Baker's cyst and he was treated with a cortisone injection. Due to persistence of symptoms, he was subsequently evaluated for possible deep venous thrombosis via venous ultrasound which indicated a left popliteal thrombus and aneurysm. As a result of this finding, he was admitted to an outside hospital for further evaluation.\nAt the outside facility, he underwent MRI of the left knee, CT angiogram with bilateral extremity runoff, and transthoracic echocardiogram. These studies revealed left popliteal aneurysm with occlusive eccentric thrombus and incomplete clot of a right renal artery branch. The following day, a transthoracic echocardiogram was done and showed a highly mobile mass attached to the anterior mitral valve leaflet, measuring approximately 1.5 cm.\nDue to the abnormal findings, he was transferred to our facility for further evaluation and management. On admission, the patient appeared well. Temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, blood pressure was 123/48, heart rate was 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturations were 98% on room air. A 1/6 holosystolic murmur heard best over the mitral valve was auscultated; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. There was no mention of onychomycosis. His laboratory evaluation demonstrated mild anemia (11.4 g/dL; reference 13.5\u201317.5 g/dL), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (60 mm/1 hour; reference 0\u201322 mm/1 hour), and elevated C-reactive protein (75.9 mg/L; reference < 8.0 mg/L). The peripheral white blood cell count and differential, platelet count, INR, and prothrombin time were all normal.\nThe patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which revealed two highly mobile masses attached to the mitral valve with the largest mass measuring approximately 1 cm by 3 cm. The patient underwent surgery the following day. Intraoperatively, the mitral valve had firm, white vegetations with destruction of both anterior and posterior leaflets. Samples were taken and sent immediately to pathology for review. The preliminary frozen pathology demonstrated fungal elements (Figures and ). He underwent aggressive debridement and mitral valve replacement with a porcine valve. The patient was started on intravenous liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg/day intraoperatively and caspofungin 50 mg daily was added the next day for empiric treatment while waiting identification of the organism. Final pathology described active native valve endocarditis with fungal organisms involving the myxomatous mitral valve. The mitral valve tissue was cultured on inhibitory mold agar and ultimately grew a Scopulariopsis species with no other microbial growth, including negative bacterial and mycobacterial cultures. Fungal blood cultures were obtained but were negative for growth. Due to the severity of the disease and highly resistant nature of the organism, oral voriconazole dosed at 300 mg twice daily was also added to the antifungal regimen.\nThe day following mitral valve debridement and replacement, vascular medicine and vascular surgery were consulted regarding the suspected mycotic aneurysm and thrombus of the left popliteal artery. CT angiogram with lower extremity runoff was repeated and showed the left popliteal artery mycotic aneurysm and thrombus, as well as bilateral renal infarcts. Ten days after mitral valve surgery, he underwent resection of the popliteal artery and peroneal artery bypass. The pathologic examination revealed GMS-positive staining hyphae, and inhibitory mold agar cultures again grew a pure culture of Scopulariopsis species.\nThe Scopulariopsis species from the cultures was ultimately identified by combined phenotypic characterization and DNA sequencing as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Phenotypically, the organism was a tan powdery colony and microscopically demonstrated branching annellides with chaining, round conidia with a truncated base consistent with Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. From a sequencing standpoint, D2 ribosomal sequencing was utilized with the top 3 matches being a greater than 95% match (100%, 99.31%, and 95.45%) to Scopulariopsis species in the Mayo Fungal Library. Antifungal susceptibilities were completed utilizing broth dilution as per recommended guidelines from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and were consistent with those reported in the literature: amphotericin 2 \u00b5g/mL, caspofungin 1 \u00b5g/mL, micafungin 0.125 \u00b5g/mL, anidulafungin 4 \u00b5g/mL, posaconazole 2 \u00b5g/mL, voriconazole 8 \u00b5g/mL, itraconazole 2 \u00b5g/mL, and terbinafine 0.5 \u00b5g/mL [].\nLiposomal amphotericin was discontinued after 18 days due to acute renal injury, and caspofungin and oral voriconazole therapy were continued. He completed 8 weeks of combination therapy and was continued on oral voriconazole for chronic suppression. Voriconazole was chosen despite susceptibility data given reported clinical efficacy combined with lack of correlation between the susceptibility data and patient outcomes []. He unfortunately developed peripheral neuropathy, suspected by his local neurologist to be secondary to the voriconazole, and he was transitioned to delayed-release oral posaconazole dosed at 100 mg daily for chronic suppression [, ]. Posaconazole levels were followed and remained therapeutic with levels >1.0 mcg/mL. The inflammatory markers normalized at 6 months. Follow-up TEEs at 3 months and 7 months postoperatively did not show recurrence of endocarditis. Further, after cessation of the voriconazole he reported improvement, but not full resolution, of his neuropathy symptoms. What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "A 45-year-old male patient arrived at our otorhinolaryngology department for an emergency examination. Owing to the policy of his employing company, he was obliged to self-test for SARS-CoV-2 twice a week. Four hours before his arrival, the patient had attempted to perform a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test (GenBody Inc, Cheonan, KR) at home by taking an OPS. Upon specimen collection, he felt a mild resistance and had a gag reflex, which resulted in the ingestion of the swab applicator.\nThe patient showed no signs of respiratory distress and had stable vital signs. He showed no apparent regurgitation of saliva. We performed a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test (Hangzhou Clungene Biotech, CN) by taking an NPS and obtained a negative result.\nDuring routine ear, nose, and throat examination, including flexible rhinopharyngolaryngoscopy, we found no foreign body in the upper respiratory tract or at the pharyngeal level.\nWe performed thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans in the supine and right lateral recumbent positions. Swab applicators are usually made of nylon. Thus, their radiopacity is not guaranteed without a documented radiopaque marking. In our case, we did not have the manufacturer\u2019s description in hand. To overcome this problem, we asked the patient to drink water to fill the stomach with fluid. After proper windowing, a radiolucent band was visible in the stomach, suggestive of a foreign body (Figure ). No other abnormalities were observable in the imaged regions.\nIn collaboration with the department of gastroenterology, we performed an urgent gastroscopy with a flexible endoscope (Olympus, JP). Despite four hours having elapsed since the incident, we still identified the swab stick intact in the stomach. After firmly catching the object with a polypectomy loop, it was withdrawn and removed safely (Figure ). A second look showed no signs of mucosal damage or any residual foreign bodies along the esophagus and stomach. We examined the foreign body and confirmed that it had been removed without missing parts (Figure ). After eventless observation, the patient was discharged on the same day.\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient for all the procedures and for the publication of information on his clinical course.

    "question": "We present a case of a 1-year-old Caucasian girl, whose past medical history was unremarkable. Two and a half months before the initial presentation, the first tooth (lower incisor) erupted and soon after 11 more teeth erupted in the upper and lower jaw.\nTwo months before admission, the girl traveled abroad with her family. The family negated symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThe girl initially developed an itchy skin rash. Two weeks later, she developed diarrhea which lasted for 6 days. A pediatrician also noticed acute otitis media and signs of acute stomatitis. Laboratory results showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP, 60 mg/l) and leukocytosis.\nOne month after the initial presentation and one week after the resolution of diarrhea, her medical condition worsened, she became irritable, refused to eat solid food, and suddenly lost three deciduous incisors from the lower jaw. The rest of her teeth in the lower jaw were mobile. There was no report of injury or elevated temperature.\nFamily history was unremarkable.\nAt admission to our hospital, she was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and irritable. Her heart rate was 176 beats/min. She presented with extensive necrosis of the frontal region of the mandibular alveolar ridge extending to deciduous molars and was missing three incisors (). The affected area was swollen and exposed, with extensive fibrin coating. Maxillary gingiva showed no signs of gingival or periodontal inflammation. There were some aphthous changes on the tongue and buccally. On the skin, there was a generalized erythematous maculopapular rash with petechiae and scratches on the trunk and buttock. Desquamation of the skin on the fingers and edema of the wrists and ankles was also seen. There was redness of the perigenital region. Peripheral lymph nodes were not enlarged. Neurologic examination was normal.\nDuring hospitalization, the second left incisor in the mandible fell out, the girl had cold limbs, and occasionally a reticular pattern was seen on the skin. Transiently, a wound between the second and third toes on the left foot was present.\nThe girl had just one peak temperature of 38.2\u00b0C; otherwise, she was afebrile and cardiovascularly compensated. On the third day after admission, she developed hypertension with systolic blood pressure between 125 and 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60 and 90 mmHg (above the 95th percentile for age and height, which is 105/60 mmHg). She also had a persistent tachycardia with a pulse rate between 150 and 180 beats/min.\nIn blood laboratory test results, there was a mild elevation of CRP (20 mg/l), negative procalcitonin, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver transaminases, and fibrinogen were elevated as well. Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) were slightly elevated.\nNasopharyngeal swab was positive for rhinovirus and enterovirus infections but was negative for other viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The swabs of the oral cavity and mandible were negative for pathogenic bacteria and herpesviruses. Skin swabs from several places showed S. aureus and Candida albicans superinfection and a vaginal swab showed the presence of Candida albicans.\nThe serology for SARS-CoV-2 was found positive for both IgG and IgA antibodies (IgG: 1.88; IgA: 2.17). Blood culture was negative. Her immune status was unremarkable, and primary immunodeficiencies were ruled out with laboratory tests. The girl had normal lymphocyte subpopulations, at presentation minimally elevated IgG levels, and normal IgM and IgA, normal test of phagocytosis, and normal values of complement. Immunoserology testing revealed positive IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) (12 AUG) and IgG anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-\u00df2GPI) [16 AUG]). Vitamin A deficiency, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, HIV, rubella, and measles infections were ruled out. The urine sample was unremarkable. The plasma renin level was normal for the girl's age [7.3 \u03bcg/l/h (ref.: 0\u20133 years: <16.6 \u03bcg/l/h)]. The heart breakdown enzymes were normal.\nCT and MR imaging of the lower jaw showed diffusely altered bone with edema and necrosis of the mandibular corpus and the above alveolar ridge in the region extending from tooth 84 to tooth 74 (). It showed severe inflammation of the surrounding soft tissues and muscles as well. There was loss of teeth 71, 81, and 82.\nUltrasound of the abdomen showed slightly enlarged liver. Doppler ultrasound of renal arteries was normal, and thyroid ultrasound was normal as well. Chest X-ray was normal. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram showed no abnormalities.\nBiopsy of the mucosa of the lower jaw, tooth, mandible (twice), and skin was performed. During biopsy, teeth 83 and 73 were removed due to total loss of supporting alveolar bone. Histopathologically (), biopsy of the mucosa of the lower jaw showed necrosis, granulation tissue, and changes compatible with epulis, corresponding partly to pyogenic granuloma and partly to peripheral ossifying fibroma. No diagnostic changes for lymphoma or Langerhans cell histiocytosis were present. Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. Necrosis and endothelial damage with individual mural thrombi and in some cases the appearance of recanalization of thrombotic changes along small vessels were seen ().\nBiopsy of the mandible showed vital reactive bone with fibrosis without suppurative inflammation indicative of active infection.\nBiopsy of the tooth showed normal structures of the tooth with adjacent structures of the alveolar ridge.\nThe second biopsy of the soft tissue of the mandible showed minimally reactive bone, and reactive spindle-cell proliferation with individual multinucleated giants of the osteoclast type. Compared with the previous biopsy, the changes were more chronic in appearance with reparative inflammation, without granulation tissue or necrosis.\nThe samples of skin changes in the sacral area were taken and sent for analysis and possible bacterial and fungal infections. Histopathologically, sacral focal necrosis of the epidermis and swelling of endothelial cells of the dermis were seen (). There was no thrombosis and no visible changes typical for malignancy, histiocytosis, or active infection. Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) was also excluded based on the skin-biopsy result. Swollen endothelial cells of small veins in the upper dermis that almost or completely close the lumen were confirmed by electronic microscopy (). There were no fibrins or platelets in the lumen of the examined vessels and on the endothelium. Endothelial cell organelles were unremarkable. No viral particles were detected. Immunofluorescence examination was unspecific.\nThe results of molecular genetic testing by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) method showed no changes in the 4,813 analyzed genes, including 304 genes associated with primary immunodeficiencies, genes associated with COVID-19 vasculitis (TREX1), type I interferonopathies (STING1, COPA), and monogenic vasculitis (DADA2) (, ).\nThe patient was treated with combined antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid intravenously. On the 13th day of hospitalization, we also introduced metronidazole 100 mg q 8 h orally and clindamycin 100 mg q 8 h intravenously and later orally. Because of the suspicion for hypercoagulability, she received antiplatelet therapy with 50 mg of acetylsalicylic acid daily. For the skin, she received ointment with a combination of corticosteroid, antibiotic, and antifungal active substance due to proven superinfection with S. aureus and Candida albicans. Against itching, she received loratadine twice daily. Against oral pain, we applied 1% lidocaine chloride locally three times a day. She needed analgesia (paracetamol 100 mg/6 h) and, due to food refusal, parenteral hydration. Due to tachycardia and arterial hypertension, she received 1 mg of antihypertensive drug amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg) twice daily.\nTwo weeks after the beginning of antimicrobial and antiplatelet therapy, the girl showed clinical improvement. The changes in the mandible and skin were no longer so pronounced, and blood pressure gradually decreased. Skin therapy slowly helped to reduce the intensity of the rash. Normalization in inflammatory parameters and decrease of D-dimer value were recorded. Thrombocytosis and slightly elevated LDH and AST persisted. Control thyroid hormones were in the normal range.\nA week after discharge, the girl was better, except for her blood pressure, which was still high, so we adjusted the therapy of amlodipine to 2 mg (0.2 mg/kg) twice daily.\nThree weeks after the discharge, she stopped antibiotic therapy, and after 1 month she also stopped taking antihypertensive drug amlodipine. Follow-up echocardiography was normal. One month after discharge, the serology for SARS-CoV-2 was negative.\nAt the last follow-up, almost 1 year after the first admission, the girl was in a better mood, no rash was present, and there was no inflammation in her oral cavity, but six teeth in the lower jaw (73, 72, 71, 81, 82, and 83) were missing, and other teeth showed caries. Her laboratory results were normal, except for persistently positive IgG aCL (11 AUG) and IgG anti-\u00df2GPI antibodies (16 AUG). What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?",

    "question": "A 32-year-old female with history of diabetes mellitus type one and a successful RYGB for morbid obesity three years ago presented to our clinic with the complaints of cough, greenish yellow sputum production, chills and night sweats for the last three months. She was feeling more fatigued, generalized weakness and unintentionally lost 33 pounds during that time. She denied recent history of travel out of state. The patient was in the United States and had never been to a country with endemic tuberculosis. She denied recent remote history of incarceration. She also denied hemoptysis, shortness of breath, headache or fever. She had no history of being diagnosed with TB or history of recent sick contacts. On physical examination, her temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, blood pressure was 116/60 mm Hg, pulse was 84 per minute and respiratory rate was 16 per minute. On chest auscultation, few rhonchi were present in the right upper lung and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. The Initial blood work showed sodium of 134 mmol/L (136\u2013145 mmol/L), potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (3.5\u20135.1 mmol/L), bicarbonate of 28 mEq/L (23\u201331 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 6 mg/dL (9\u201321 mg/dL), creatinine of 0.33 mg/dL (0.6\u20131.1 mg/dL), glucose of 150 mg/dL (80\u2013115 mg/dL) and liver function tests were within normal range. Her white blood cell count was 14,500/\u00b5L (4500\u201311000/\u00b5L) with 81% neutrophils. Her chest X-ray showed multiple small nodular opacities throughout the right lung with a probable cavity in the right lung apex (Figure ). Suspicion was raised for possible active TB and she was admitted in airborne isolation. Two peripheral blood cultures, sputum culture along with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were ordered. Computed tomography (CT) chest without contrast showed multiple thick-walled cavities in the right upper lobe. The largest cavity was 7 cm. There were innumerable centrilobular nodules and tree in bud opacities throughout the right lung (Figures , ). Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus was detected by sputum AFB staining and later confirmed by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. She also had a positive QuantiFERON test. She was started on anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) medications including Isoniazid 300 mg daily, Rifampin 300 mg twice daily, Ethambutol 800 mg daily, Pyrazinamide 1000 mg daily and Pyridoxine 50 mg daily for the first two months and then two drugs Isoniazid and Rifampin for the next four months. After three days of hospital stay, she started showing some improvement in her symptoms such as cough and night sweats. She understood the isolation precautions, especially respiratory precautions and use of mask in the presence of other individuals. She was later discharged in stable condition with the above-mentioned medications. She had complete resolution of her symptoms in two months and completed six months course of ATT.

    "question": "A 17-year-old female patient weighing 35 Kg presented to emergency department with history of chronic intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and anorexia for three months, history of recurrent generalized tonic clonic seizures for 2 days and history of rapidly progressive ascending type of limb weakness with respiratory distress for one day. She had no history of snakebite, pain chest, poison intake, or blunt injury to neck or abdomen.\nShe initially presented to a private nursing home where she was intubated and transferred to our hospital on portable ventilator. On examination she was conscious (E4VTM1) with power of 1/5 in all limbs, plantars were mute, and deep tendon reflexes were absent. Her heart rate was 120/min and blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg. She was breathing at a set rate given by ventilator. Systemic examination was insignificant. She was transferred to intensive care unit with a diagnosis of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. She also had features suggestive of autonomic neuropathy in the form of postural hypotension, tachycardia, and sweating.\nRoutine baseline workups including hemogram, blood sugars, liver and kidney function, chest X-ray, electrocardiography, electroencephalography were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Urine Watson\u2013Schwartz test[] was positive for porphobilinogen. Electrolyte screening showed mild hyponatremia (serum sodium 126 mmol/L). Serum phosphates and serum potassium were within normal limits. Ultrasonography of abdomen was unremarkable and serum lead levels were within normal limits. Nerve conduction study showed axonal motor neuropathy.\nShe was treated as a case of AIP with high dose of carbohydrate (300\u2013400gm/day), heme arginate (3 mg/kg/day for 4 days) and gabapentin for seizures control. Precautions were taken not to prescribe any porphyrogenic drugs. At 60th day of her ICU stay ST segment elevation was noticed on the cardiac monitor and 12 lead ECG was ordered which showed [] ST segment elevation in lead II. Cardiac enzyme markers were not elevated. Transthoracic echocardiography was done to rule out any cardiac pathology. It showed posterior pericardial calcification with anterior mitral leaflet and papillary muscle calcification [Figures and ] and relaxation abnormality around mitral valve suggestive of early pericardial constriction. Serum calcium (10.8 mg/dl) and phosphorus levels (5 mg/dl) were within normal limits. Tracheal tube aspirate for acid-fast bacilli was negative for 3 days in continuation.

    "question": "An 11-year-old male patient presented to a healthcare facility with fever and cough for 2 days and had been referred to our hospital for a preliminary diagnosis of complicated pneumonia. On physical examination, he weighed 30 kg, body temperature was 39\u00b0C, maximum heart rate was 125 bpm, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, and a blood pressure reading of 115/77 mm Hg was noted. On auscultation, he had diminished breath sounds over the right hemithorax. There were palpable submandibular lymph nodes of 1.5 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm on both sides and palpable right axillary lymph node of 1 cm \u00d7 0.5 cm in size. Other physical examination findings were normal. Complete blood count results were as follows: leukocyte count, 8290/mm3; hemoglobin, 9.8 g/dL; and platelet count, 545000/mm3. The sedimentation rate was 38 mm/hour. A thoracic ultrasonography revealed septated pleural fluid with a dense content, which reached a depth of up to 30 mm. A thoracic catheter was placed, and intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator was administered three times. Intravenous ceftriaxone and clindamycin were administered. A thoracic computed tomography was taken, showing multiple lymph nodes having a conglomerated appearance, the largest of which measured 18 mm \u00d7 13 mm, in the mediastinal pretracheal, subcarinal, and right hilar regions. There existed a dense pleural effusion with a depth of up to 35 mm in the basal part of the right hemithorax. We also observed intensive pleural fluid in the right hemithorax from apex to the basale in coronal and sagittal images ( and ). As the pleural biopsy material was necrotic and mycobacteria polymerase chain reaction was positive, pathological examination could not be done. An echocardiogram revealed normal findings. As the patient's fever and respiratory difficulty persisted and his radiological signs did not improve, his antibiotic therapy was switched to piperacillin plus teicoplanin. Pleural fluid and blood cultures were negative. Serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C, chlamydia, and mycoplasma were all negative. His clinical symptom did not improve with nonspecific therapy, and he was started on pyrazinamide, isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol as antituberculosis treatment empirically. He could not use antituberculous therapy for the first week due to vomiting.\nPurified protein derivative measured 10 mm; acid-resistant bacilli were negative in the sputum and fasting gastric juice. He had QuantiFERON positive. His family screen for tuberculosis turned negative. He was noted to have bicytopenia in full blood count on the 35th day of follow-up, and a bone marrow aspiration was performed, which revealed signs of dysplasia in normoblasts and two hemophagocytosis. His laboratory results were as follows: ferritin: 11.735 ng/mL (N: 5.6\u2013216), fibrinogen: 159 mg/dL (N: 200\u2013400), alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 154 U/L (N: 0\u201355), aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 1,196 U/L (N: 5\u201334), gamma-glutamyl transferase: 464 U/L (38\u201354), cholesterol: 102 mg/dL, triglyceride: 164 mg/dL, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH): 2936 U/L (N: 110\u2013295), albumin: 2.4 g/dL (3.5\u20135), direct bilirubin (D.Bil): 1.78 mg/dL, c-reactive protein (CRP): 6.6 mg/dL (N: 0\u20130.5), procalcitonin: 16.4 ng/mL (N: <0.05), sodium: 132 mEq/L (N: 138\u2013145), and international normalized ratio (INR): 1.62. A hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to tuberculosis infection was primarily considered. As his fever did not subside and his tachypnea persisted, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. There he was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days. An 11.5 Fr hemodialysis catheter was placed, and 10 sessions of TPE with adjunctive fresh frozen plasma were performed. A cervical lymph node biopsy was taken, which was consistent with tuberculosis infection. As his clinical condition did not improve, dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 was commenced. Subsequently, during follow-up, his fever subsided, rash, tachypnea eliminated, and appetite returned to normal. Subsequent laboratory values were as follows: ferritin: 297 ng/mL, fibrinogen: 356 mg/dL, ALT: 26 U/L, AST: 22 U/L, triglyceride: 164 mg/dL, LDH: 295 U/L, albumin: 23.8 g/dL, D.Bil: 0.3 mg/dL, CRP: 0.2 mg/dL, procalcitonin: 0.14 ng/mL, sodium: 138 mEq/L, and INR: 0.99. The patient was transferred to the Department of Pediatrics. Sequencing of PRF1 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed heterozygous mutation (Exon 2, codon 91 GCG/GTG, and Ala/Val).

    "question": "A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 \u03bcg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

    "question": "This is a case of a 15-month-old male who was referred to King Saud Medical Complex in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for a multidisciplinary follow-up plan and genetic testing. Regarding his history, the patient was delivered at the 39th gestational week of a 23-year-old mother by cesarean section due to the failure of progression, weighing 2.4 kg, and was reported to have developed respiratory distress upon birth. Regarding the mother, she is medically free and was on multivitamins while there were no reports of any radiation or teratogenic exposure that was reported during her pregnancy. After birth, the patient was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for six months due to his abnormal respiration. There is no family history of any genetic disorders, consanguinity, or congenital anomalies.\nInitially, the patient was suffering from developmental delay and extensor muscle weakness of the upper and lower limbs. Moreover, an epiglottopexy procedure was performed due to choanal atresia and a high arched palate. Afterward, he was breathing on room air through a nasal cannula. Ever since the epiglottopexy, the patient has been on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with no attempt to wean him off the ventilation due to poor response. Even though the patient did not present any gastrointestinal abnormalities, there was a difficulty in feeding, which led to nasogastric tube insertion for oral nutrition and supplementation. The patient also developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which was confirmed by testing; an abnormal facial shape, which was a dysmorphic triangular face; coloboma; and bilateral low-set ears. A shallow acetabular roof, micropenis, small bilateral kidney, high arched palate, and hypo-plastic left thumb was also noted (Figure ). Regarding the cardiovascular system, the patient had a moderate to large ventricular septal defect (VSD), dilated left atrium and left ventricle, and mild pulmonary stenosis. Furthermore, the patient did not develop any seizures or loss of consciousness, but he was hypotonic. However, his gastrointestinal system showed no abnormalities.\nRegarding the investigation, his blood work was within normal limits except for a low serum creatinine of 13 \u00b5mol/L (normal range: 71-133 \u00b5mol/L) and hyponatremia of 130 mEq/L. Meanwhile, his brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild periventricular leukomalacia, benign external hydrocephalus, with the suggestion of Blake's pouch cyst (Figure ). The genetic investigation was performed for the patient, and he was found to have chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7), c.2572C\u02c3T p(Arg858), and the diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome was confirmed based on the physical examination and the gene sequencing report. The patient is in hospital and is followed up by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a cardiologist, neurologist, nephrologist, general pediatrician, gastroenterologist, otolaryngologist, ophthalmologist, pulmonologist, and physiotherapist with a plan to try and increase and improve his life expectancy and quality of life moving forward.

    "question": "A 16-year-old boy with KFS presented to our hospital's oral and maxillofacial surgery department with complaints of an inability to bite and chew food, lisping speech, and chronic jaw pain. He was born through cesarean section to nonconsanguineous parents and had no complications. His identical twin brother was absolutely normal. His past surgical history included two surgeries immediately after birth for anorectal agenesis and left orchidopexy at 3 years of age for undescended testis. On examination, he had grossly restricted neck movements, a low hair line at the back of the neck, malaligned teeth, marked mandibular prognathism, an extensive anterior open bite, and psychological disturbances. He had marked kyphoscoliosis of the thoracic spine and a right Sprengel deformity ().\nAn airway examination revealed Mallampati II with normal mouth opening and an inability to flex or extend the neck. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm and echocardiography findings were normal. Radiography of the neck revealed fusion of the upper six cervical vertebrae (). Chest radiography revealed thoracic kyphoscoliosis with Cobb angle>35\u00b0 (). His exercise tolerance was good and he had a metabolic equivalent of task value of 8. He had a weight of 50 kg and height of 150 cm. His heart rate was 78 beats per minute and regular, blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute. Laboratory findings included: hemoglobin, 13 gm%; platelets, 2.34 lakhs/mm3; serum glucose, 99 mg/dL; sodium, 142 mEq/dL; potassium, 4.2 mEq/dL; serum urea, 18.0 mg/dL; and serum creatinine, 0.67 mg/dL. A pulmonary function test revealed moderately restrictive lung disease. Nasal endoscopy revealed a leftward deviated nasal septum (DNS) and compensatory hypertrophy of the right inferior turbinate. Computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses confirmed those findings ().\nAfter his parents provided informed consent, he underwent elective bilateral sagittal slip osteotomy of the mandible and a genioplasty. Oral ranitidine 150 mg was administered the night before and the morning of the surgery, and he fasted for 6 hours prior to the surgery. To avoid a secondary cervical spine injury, he was self-positioned on the table with proper padding of the right elevated scapula and pressure points. His neck and head were properly padded and supported. His basal oxygen saturation was 98%; an arterial blood gas analysis on room air revealed: pH, 7.35; PaCO2, 43 mmHg; PaO2, 107 mmHg; bicarbonate, 24 mmol/L; and arterial oxygen saturation, 99%. An 18-gauge intravenous cannula was inserted on the dorsum of the left hand and a Ringers lactate infusion was started. Cephalexin 1 g was given intravenously.\nThe patient was connected to a multipara monitor displaying the ECG, noninvasive arterial pressure, invasive arterial pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), pulse oximetry, and core temperature. ECG showed sinus rhythm with: heart rate, 89 beats/min; a normal axis; blood pressure, 120/60 mmHg; and respiratory rate, 16 breaths/min. His right radial artery was cannulated and connected to a pressure transducer for blood gas sampling and continuous blood pressure monitoring. Considering his fairly reasonable metabolic equivalent of task value and hemodynamic parameters, an invasive central venous pressure line was considered unnecessary. Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg and ondansetron 4 mg were given intravenously.\nAwake fiber optic bronchoscopy-guided orotracheal intubation was planned to secure the airway, followed by submental intubation to ensure unhindered surgical access (). A backup emergency surgical airway kit was kept in case of failure of the first method. The oropharynx was nebulized with 4% lignocaine. The larynx and trachea were anesthetized by nebulization with lignocaine. Supplemental oxygen was administered via a nasal catheter. A 5.5-mm fiber optic bronchoscope was used and a 7.5-mm cuffed reinforced endotracheal tube was slid up the full length of the shaft and gently secured to the beveled end of the bronchoscope. The tube was passed over the bronchoscope into the trachea just above the carina. Tube position was confirmed by capnographic trace and bilateral equal air entry. The cuff was inflated to seal the airway and the tube was securely fixed. Fentanyl 50 \u00b5g (1 \u00b5g/kg), propofol 100 mg, and atracurium 25 mg were administered intravenously. Anesthesia was maintained using a mixture of 50% oxygen and 50% air and 1\u20131.5% isoflurane through a closed circuit with intermittent doses of atracurium. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was instituted and ETCO2 was maintained at 35 mmHg.\nThe throat was packed with sterile tape gauze. Temporary draping of the mouth and chin were performed after standard skin preparation with 10% povidone-iodine solution. The surgeon made a 1.5-cm incision in the left submental triangle after local infiltration of the skin with 2% xylocaine with adrenaline. A Kelly's forceps was introduced through the skin incision and into the floor of the mouth by blunt dissection. The tube cuff was first introduced into the mouth after deflation and pulled inferiorly to pass through the intraoral tunnel and emerge through the submental incision. The proximal end of the reinforced tube was then disconnected from the circuit and connector and pulled extraorally through the submental incision. The connector was reattached and the circuit was re-established. Endotracheal tube position was checked again to ensure bilateral equal air entry. The cuff was inflated and the tube was sutured to the overlying skin and fixed with plaster tape to prevent accidental extubation. A fresh pharyngeal pack was then reinserted after removing the existing soaked throat pack. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was instituted through a closed circuit with a circle absorber.\nPerioperatively, no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate were noted (systolic pressure 95\u2013110 mmHg, diastolic pressure 70\u201390 mmHg, and heart rate 80\u2013110 beats/min). The mean arterial pressure was maintained at 90\u2013100 mmHg. The surgery lasted for 3 hours and a total of 1200 mL of Ringers lactate was given. His arterial blood gas values during the perioperative period showed: pH 7.38; PaO2, 158 mmHg; and PaCO2, 35 mmHg. Intravenous dexamethasone 8 mg and ondansetron 4 mg was given toward the end of the procedure.\nAt the end of the surgical procedure, the stay sutures around the tube were removed and the deflated cuff and tube were pulled in reverse order from the tunnel to the oral cavity. The oropharynx and nasopharynx were adequately suctioned and the throat pack was removed. The submental incision was sutured externally and a dressing was applied to the external wound. The intraoral incision was allowed for secondary healing and the residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 2.5 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.5 mg until neuromuscular transmission recovered to a train of four ratio of 0.9.\nHe was extubated awake with all protective airway reflexes and shifted to the postoperative recovery area. In this case, apnea during the circuit disconnection was 35 seconds and the total submental intubation was around 5 minutes. He was shifted to the high dependency unit for observation. The postoperative period was uneventful and he recovered well. What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L.",

    "question": "A 38-year-old man presented to an emergency department with progressive weakness and decreased urine output after having vomited up to 20 times per day over a period of 7 days. The patient was referred to our intensive care unit. Before medical consultation, he was healthy, and no other symptoms were reported. Diarrhea, fever, chills, or abdominal pain was absent.\nClinical examination revealed a patient of normal weight (height: 180 cm, weight: 70 kg). Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated (150/80 mmHg, 105/min); the respiratory rate was normal (13/min), but oxygen saturation was low (89%). During blood pressure measurement, a positive Trousseau sign was noted. The mucous membranes were dry, and the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nArterial blood gas analysis revealed a metabolic alkalosis with partial respiratory compensation (pH: 7.71 [7.35\u20137.45], base excess: 40.5 mmol/l [-2-3 mmol/l], pCO2: 56.1 mmHg [32\u201345 mmHg], pO2: 43.5 mmHg [83\u2013108 mmHg], bicarbonate: 72.2 mmol/l [21\u201326 mmol/l], lactate: 2.8 mmol/l [0.5\u20131.6 mmol/l], chloride: 52 mmol/l [98\u2013106 mmol/l], sodium: 130 mmol/l [136\u2013146 mmol/l], potassium: 2.4 mmol/l [3.5\u20135.1 mmol/l], ionized calcium: 0.77 mmol/l [1.15\u20131.29 mmol/l] and glucose: 165 mg/dl [70\u2013105 mg/dl]).\nUltrasound revealed a distended and full stomach; the inferior vena cava was collapsing on inspiration. Otherwise, the ultrasound was unremarkable. The electrocardiography [] showed a prolonged QT interval (QTc 547 ms).\nLaboratory tests were consistent with acute kidney injury (creatinine: 5.2 mg/dl, urea: 176 mg/dl); liver function tests, coagulation tests, albumin, lipase, procalcitonin, total calcium, hemoglobin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Leukocytes were minimally elevated (11500/\u03bcl).\nWe suspected a prerenal acute kidney injury and a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to gastric losses of HCl and fluids. Initial management consisted of oxygen therapy to correct hypoxemia and intravenous fluid therapy with normal saline and potassium chloride. Initially, a balanced crystalloid solution was infused, and later normal saline with KCl (40 mmol/l) was used because of the higher chloride content. Metoclopramide was administered to promote gastric emptying. To prevent further gastric losses of HCl, a proton-pump inhibitor was given. The patient was put on nihil per os for 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, a total of 4.5 l of crystalloid fluid was infused. There was no further vomiting. A repeated bedside ultrasound revealed an empty stomach. The pH was corrected to 7.49, bicarbonate was reduced to 48.6 mmol/l, base excess was 23.4, chloride was 69 mmol/l, and potassium was still low at 2.8 mmol/l. There was hypoventilation with a pCO2 of 68.4 mmHg. We noted onset of diuresis. After 72 h of fluid therapy, the acid-base and electrolyte status was normal. Creatinine had decreased to 3.5 mg/dl. Small meals were tolerated.\nSince there was no evidence of an infectious etiology for the excessive vomiting and the ultrasound had shown a distended stomach, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed []. A significant stenosis of the duodenum was diagnosed. Although there was no ulcer visible, an occult ulcer was deemed to be possible. A portal hypertensive gastropathy was diagnosed while esophageal varices were absent. Helicobacter pylori testing was positive, so an eradication therapy was initiated. A repeated endoscopy confirmed the stenosis, but again, no ulcer was seen. Since a focused abdominal ultrasound did not reveal the reason for the stenosis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed to rule out malignancy such as pancreatic or gallbladder cancer or a thrombosis of the mesenteric vein. There was no evidence of malignancy or cirrhosis. An endosonography was done without evidence of malignancy or mesenteric vein thrombosis. At that point, the stenosis had partly resolved, and endoscopic passage was possible. We concluded that the temporary duodenal stenosis was caused most likely by portal hypertension of unknown etiology, and our differential diagnosis included idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension after exclusion of cirrhosis and portal vein obstruction.

    "question": "A 56-year-old man was admitted to the renal unit of the tertiary university hospital with symptoms of polyuria with nocturia, and polydipsia with severe thirst for the past 2 months. Initially, the patient visited a local clinic and was diagnosed as type 2 DM with a fasting blood sugar, 150mg/dL. Despite being controlled hyperglycemia with an oral hypoglycemic agent, he continued drinking daily more than 8 L of cold water (about 10 bottles of refrigerated water, 750 ml capacity) and passed large amounts of urine frequently. He had no specific history including head trauma or mental disorder, and denied any pertinent family history. The patient showed no signs of systemic illness such as fever or arthralgia, or neurologic symptoms involving the central nervous system. He has been working as a gardener with 176 cm in height and 68 kg in weight (71 kg before this event). The physical examination was unremarkable with blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, pulse rate of 80/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and temperature of 36.8\u2103. In the laboratory findings, his white blood cell count was 9,700/mm3; hemoglobin, 13.4 g/dL; platelet, 376\u00d7103/mm3; sodium, 140 mEq/L; potassium, 3.8 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 12 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL and osmolality 295 mOsm/kg water. HbA1c was 7.2% and post-prandial glucose was checked around 180mg/dl with fasting blood sugar of 140 mg/dL. In urine analysis, the urine pH was 6.0; specific gravity 1.006; albumin (-); glucose (-); WBC 0-4/HPF; RBC 0-2/HPF, and osmolality 140mOsm/kg water. Fluid intake and output in 24 hours recorded 9 L in oral water intake from water containers and 11.7 L in urine output. In hormone assays, ACTH was 25.2 pg/mL (reference value, 6.0-76.0 pg/mL), prolactin 8 \u00b5g/L (reference value, 0-15 \u00b5g/L), cortisol 9.8 \u00b5g/dL (referencel value, 5-25 \u00b5g/dL), hGH 2.26 ng/mL (reference value, 0.5-17 ng/mL), and TSH 0.99 \u00b5U/mL (reference value, 0.5-4.7 \u00b5U/mL). Also, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was within normal range (reference value, <40 U/L).\nOn hospital day 5, the patient underwent a water deprivation test according to the method of Miller-Moses test because of persistent polydipsia and polyuria despite blood glucose control. The results are shown in . During dehydration, the patient lost 3kg (4.4% of body weight), and urine osmolality remained hypotonic below 130 mOsm/kg. Basal ADH level was 5.18 pg/dL, and the repeat ADH level following the stimulation by water deprivation was 3.95 pg/dL, which revealed no increment despite the increased serum osmolality up to 300 mOsm/kg from the baseline levels of 285 to 295 mOsm/kg. One puff (5 \u00b5g) of desmopressin nasal spray resulted in the increase of urine osmolality to 266 mOsm/kg (>100% increase from the baseline level, 126 mOsm/kg) and in the marked reduction of urine output from 200-410 ml/hr to 44-60 ml/hr. These results were compatible with CDI,, whose causes would be mostly idiopathic because of normal findings in hypothalamus and hypophysis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of sella ().\nOn discharge (hospital day 9), the dose of desmopressin nasal spray (minirin nasal spray\u00ae) was adjusted to 1 puff per 12 hrs (10 \u00b5g/day), and urine output was markedly reduced to below 2-3 L/day with no more intense thirst. Also, DM was controlled with fasting blood sugar below 115 mg/dL by metformin (novamet GR\u00ae 500mg bid) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended diet.

She underwent stomach lavage and treatment with activated charcoal at that facility, and was transferred to our hospital an hour after ingestion. She was conscious, responsive, and cooperative, and she had diarrhea. On physical examination she had a blood pressure of 125/55 mmHg, body temperature 36.5\u00b0C, respiratory rate 15 breaths/minute, and heart rate 70 beats/minute. The patient was pale and cold, and she had abdominal tenderness on palpation. Other system examinations were unremarkable. She was admitted to the intensive care unit. Her initial laboratory findings in the intensive care unit were WBC, 6.640 (103 \u03bcL); hemoglobin, 13 gr/dL; hematocrit, 40.3%; PLTs, 428,000/mm3; AST, 32 U/L; ALT, 21 U/L; sodium, 139 mmol/L; K, 4.1 mmol/L; Ca, 9.5 mmol/L; Total-CK, 112 U/L; CK-MB, 25 U/L; LDH, 156 U/L; troponin I, 0.00 ng/ml; D-dimer, 1,833.78 ng/L; INR, 1.14; BUN, 13 mg/dL; Cr, 0.7 mg/dL.

Following the recommendation of the contacted poison control center, gastric lavage was performed again and activated charcoal was given every hour for 6 hours (0.25 g/kg per hour) to reduce the intestinal colchicine absorption. Blood gas analyses were performed every 12 hours (). On follow-up of the patient, AST, ALT, Total-CK, CK-MB, troponin I, LDH, and INR remained normal (). Normal sinus rhythm was determined by electrocardiography, and echocardiography revealed the left ventricle had normal systolic function and an ejection fraction of 60%. She did not need hemodialysis and was transferred to the internal medicine service on the fifth day of her admission. The consultant psychiatrist diagnosed a depressive episode as the underlying cause for her suicide attempt. She recovered without sequelae and was discharged on the seventh day of her follow-up.

    "question": "The patient was a 10-day-old boy with no known family history. He was delivered vaginally at another facility on the fourth day of gestational week 39. His birth weight was 2734 g and he had an Apgar score of 8/9. At 10 days of age, the patient was seen by a physician at the same facility for his two-week checkup, during which he was found to be not gaining weight at a healthy rate (+9 g/day). On the same day, a newborn mass screening test found that he may have 21-OHD. The patient was then taken to our hospital\u2019s emergency department.\nThe physical findings at admission were as follows: body weight, 2634 g; body temperature, 38.2 \u00b0C; heart rate, 147 bpm; blood pressure, 74/45 mmHg; respiratory rate, 40 breaths per minute; SpO2, 100% (room air); sunken anterior fontanelle; no conjunctival congestion; mild conjunctival jaundice; and no pharyngeal redness. Regarding the chest, there were regular heart sounds with no murmurs and clear breath sounds. The abdomen was soft and flat with normal peristaltic sounds. Pigmentation of the genital area was observed (Figure ).\nPeripheral body areas were not cold to the touch. Dry skin was present.\nLaboratory tests were performed after admission. A mass screening test performed on day four found a very high concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP; direct method) of 279.5 ng/mL. A markedly low sodium level (125 mEq/L) and markedly high potassium level (8.5 mEq/L) were also observed. At a later date, endocrine testing results showed that the levels of the following items were elevated: testosterone, 514.8 ng/dL; aldosterone, 103.9 ng/dL; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 323.0 pg/mL; and renin, >45 ng/(mL\u00b7h). The levels of the following parameters were within the normal ranges: cortisol, 14.9 \u03bcg/dL; and estradiol, 28.4 pg/mL. Additionally, urinary steroid profile using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that urinary 3\u03b1, 17\u03b1, 20\u03b1-pregnanetriolone (Ptl) (21.818 mg/g Cre), pregnanediol (PD5) (0.230 mg/g Cre) and 11\u03b2-hydroxyandorosterone (11-OHAn) (4.894 mg/g Cre) (Table ).\nAt the beginning of hospitalization, based on the results of mass screening testing and clinical symptoms, the patient was diagnosed with classic 21-OHD. The patient was considered to have acute adrenal failure due to hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Intravenous HC was administered rapidly at 100 mg/m2. Thereafter, a 100 mg/(m2\u00b7day) dose of HC and saline were administered by continuous infusion. Glucose-insulin therapy was initiated to treat the hyperkalemia. On Hospitalization Day 3, his body temperature reached 39.2 \u00b0C. His urinalysis revealed leukocytes and bacteriuria (Streptococcus agalactiae 100,000 CFU/mL collected by catheterization), and renal ultrasonography found grade 1 hydronephrosis of the left kidney (Figure ).\nAs sepsis workup, we also performed bacterial cultures in blood and spinal fluid; no bacteria were detected in these samples. Therefore, an intravenous antibiotics treatment for UTI was started. The patient was able to keep his body temperature below 37.5\u2103 on Hospitalization Day 5, but the hyperkalemia persisted. At that time, we considered pseudohyperkalemia by blood sampling, acute renal failure, urinary obstruction, hemolysis, and drug-induced as the differential diagnosis of hyperkalemia, but all of them were denied. The doses of HC and FC are dependent on the individual patient and managed based on the severity of clinical symptoms []. Consequently, using serum potassium levels as an indicator, the dose of HC was increased to 120 mg/(m2\u00b7day) on Hospitalization Day 7 and then further increased to 144 mg/(m2\u00b7day) on Hospitalization Day 9. Despite these dose increases, serum potassium levels could not be controlled; therefore, oral administration of 0.18 mg/day FC and 0.1 g/(kg\u00b7day) sodium chloride was initiated. On Hospitalization Day 18, the serum potassium level was 7.5 mEq/L, and the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) and fractional excretion of sodium were 2.5 and 9.29 %, respectively. Since these findings suggested low aldosterone bio-activity, the dose of FC was increased to 0.36 mg/day. Thereafter, serum potassium levels gradually decreased. In addition, a mass screening test was again performed again on Hospitalization Day 14, revealing that the 17-OHP concentration (direct method) decreased to 4.9 ng/mL. On Hospitalization Day 18, the serum renin activity had reduced to 17.7 ng/(mL\u00b7h). Thereafter, the dose of HC was gradually reduced to 35 mg/(m2\u00b7day). The patient was discharged on Hospitalization Day 38 (Figure ).\nFollowing discharge, the doses of HC and FC were reduced to maintenance doses of 12 mg/(m2\u00b7day) and 0.2 mg/day, respectively. The administration of sodium chloride was discontinued. The patient has received regular follow-up care, but no notable findings and no electrolyte abnormalities have been observed to date, and the low TTKG improved to 7.4.

Arterial blood gas analysis was as follows: PH: 7.47, PCO2: 31mmHg, HCO3: 22 mEq/L.\nBlood count was normal 16 days prior to our visit. In peripheral blood smear no other abnormal point was seen except microcytic anemia, and mild thrombocytopenia. Chest X-ray was normal. In abdominal ultrasound, liver and spleen size were normal and there was sand in inferior pole of right kidney. Despite severe hypercalcemia, there were no significant electrocardiographic changes. The corrected QT interval (QTc) was in the normal range and echocardiography was normal. Serum levels of PTH and 1,25-(OH)2 Vitamin D were 7 pg/ml (10-65 pg/ml) and 15 pg/ml (20-70 pg/ml), respectively, but it was impossible to measure PTHrP. Bone marrow aspiration was performed for the patient due to anemia, thrombocytopenia, prolonged fever, and weight loss. Bone marrow smears showed ALL with L1 morphology. Flowcytometry of bone marrow was also consistent with early pre B-ALL phenotype. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow was normal and showed 46, XY karyotype. Bone marrow samples analysis for t (9; 22), t (12; 21), t (1; 19), and t (4; 11) using PCR method were negative.\nPatient was hospitalized in pediatric intensive care unit for treatment and close monitoring of severe hypercalcemia. Aggressive hydration with normal saline was started with two times of the maintenance. Pamidronate 1 mg/kg IV infusion over 4 hours and furosemide 1 mg/kg IV every 6 hours was started. After 12 hours of treatment onset, regarding the serum calcium level increment from 15.8 to 17 mg/dl, dexamethasone (2 mg every 12 hours) was added to the previous treatment. Since serum calcium level was 16 mg/dl, 36 hours after treatment, the patient underwent emergency hemodialysis, and then calcium level became normal. Pamidronate and furosemide were discontinued and regarding the diagnosis of ALL, the patient was undergone chemotherapy protocol ALL IC-BFM 2002. Dexamethasone was continued and calcium remained within normal limits and the patient's clinical symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, weakness and lethargy resolved. Bone marrow aspiration on day 15 showed complete remission with less than 5% blasts (M1 marrow).

    "question": "A 17-year-old African American male who was previously healthy with the exception of high blood pressure presented to a referring hospital with a 4-day history of coughing, vomiting, headache, facial edema, and lower extremity cramping. One day prior to admission, he also had noticed decreased urine output. At the referring hospital, he was found to be hypertensive with a serum creatinine of 52 mg/dL (4597 \u00b5mol/L) and was transferred to our pediatric intensive care unit for further evaluation and treatment.\nPatient was born at term gestation and there were no significant health problems. Patient during his routine clinic visits was noted to have high blood pressure by his primary care physician but no further evaluation was done as the blood pressure was attributed to his obesity. Patient did not have any prior surgeries and was not taking any medications. There was no significant history of renal disease, dialysis, or kidney transplant in any of the family members.\nOn admission, patient was noted to be afebrile, hypertensive with blood pressure of 179/93 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and tachypneic with respiratory rate in the 40s but saturating at 100% on room air. His anthropometric measurements showed his height to be 180 cm, his weight to be 115 kg, and body mass index to be >99%. Pertinent positives in physical exam include obesity, respiratory distress with nasal flaring, bilateral periorbital edema, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results showed the patient to have azotemia with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 203 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 52 mg/dL, measured by enzymatic method. He had severe metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate of 10 mmol/L. Patient also had severe electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (126 mmol/L), hyperkalemia (6.3 mmol/L), hyperphosphatemia (10.5 mg/dL), hypocalcemia (5.3 mg/dL), and severe anemia with hemoglobin at 5.1 g/dL. Parathyroid hormone levels were elevated at 682 pg/mL (normal 11\u201380 pg/mL). Urine dipstick showed 3+ protein and 2+ blood and a urine protein to creatinine ratio was elevated at 14 (normal <0.2). Serological workup including complement levels, antinuclear antibodies, antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies was negative. Chest X-ray was significant for cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram showed severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Renal ultrasound revealed bilateral small, echogenic kidneys (right kidney 7.7 \u00d7 5.2 \u00d7 4.8 cm; left kidney 8.7 \u00d7 4.3 \u00d7 4.1 cm) consistent with dysplastic kidneys. Patient emergently underwent hemodialysis for fluid overload and to correct electrolyte imbalance. His anemia and electrolyte imbalances were slowly corrected. He is currently transitioned to peritoneal dialysis awaiting kidney transplant. What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

    "question": "A 39-year-old male patient (173 cm, 135 kgm, body mass index: 45.1) was a case of morbid obesity. He had undergone laparoscopic SG for morbid obesity on August 21, 2018, which led to his poor appetite, nausea and vomiting. In following 3 weeks, he lost 17 kilograms of body weight. On September 16, 2018, he was sent to our hospital due to persistent watery diarrhea, dehydration, and general weakness for 3 days. Upon the arrival at our hospital, his vital signs were blood pressure 117/57 mm Hg, pulse rate 108/min, respiratory rate 18/min, body temperature 37.1\u00b0C. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. The laboratory data revealed severe hypokalemia (K 2.6 mmol/L [3.6\u20135.1]), acute kidney injury (Bun 29 mg/dL [8\u201320], Cr 4.36 mg/dL [0.44\u20131.03] estimated Glomerular filtration rate 16 [mL/min]), and normal liver, pancreas, cardiac enzymes as well as other electrolytes (Na 137 mmol/L [136\u2013144], Cl 111 mmol/L [100\u2013111], bicarbonate 26 mmol/L [22\u201326]) (Table ). Other positive findings were mild anemia and leukocytosis (white blood cell 10.1^103/uL [3.8\u201310.0], Hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL [12\u201316]), elevated C-Reactive protein 2.3 mg/dL (<1.0) and lactic acid 3.1 mmol/L (0.5\u20132.2).\nHe was admitted for aggressive intravenous hydration. On the third day of admission, the patient's potassium level (3.2 mmol/L) and kidney function (Bun 23 mg/dL, Cr 2.57 mg/dL, eGFR 30 mL/min) were getting better, but he was getting deteriorated with drowsy consciousness. The brain computed tomography revealed no significant findings. Tracing his medical history, he was diagnosed as a bipolar affective disorder for 20 years. He was under regular follow-up in the psychiatric clinic with lithium carbonate 600 mg twice daily, risperidone 2 mg twice daily, and flurazepam 60 mg once daily. He was still taking the same dosage during these days after surgery. Lithium level was found to be 3.42 mEq/L and lithium toxicity was diagnosed. Lithium carbonate was discontinued immediately, and urgent hemodialysis was suggested by nephrologist.\nAfter 3 courses of hemodialysis, his serum lithium level subsequently declined to 0.63 mEq/L and creatinine level to 1.58 mg/dL, while his consciousness returned normal. In the following days, neurologic sequelae were noted by muscle weakness (muscle power 2 points over bilateral dorsi-flexors and plantar-flexors) and pain sensation in both feet. The nerve conduction test revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy with conduction block. The patient was discharged thirty-five days after admission, while his serum lithium and creatinine level declined to 0.06 mEq/L and 1.05 mg/dl, respectively. He was advised to keep a passive range of motion exercise until the nerve function recovers. Lithium carbonate was replaced by lamotrigine now.

    "question": "A 32-year-old, 173 cm, 79 kg male patient was admitted to the emergency room (ER) for the treatment of facial pain due to an automobile accident. On arrival, he was fully conscious with an Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15 and stable vital signs: blood pressure (BP) 115/76 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 58 beats/min, and body temperature 37\u2103. Frontal skull fracture was suspected, and an X-ray skull and computed tomography (CT) were taken which demonstrated a fracture of the zygomatic bone on the right side. Under general anesthesia, an open reduction of the right sided zygomatic bone fracture was planned. Patient's medical history, neurological and physical examinations were normal. Preoperative blood test findings were normal: Na+ 143 mEq/L, K+ 3.9 mEq/L, Cl- 106 mEq/L, Ca2+ 9.3 mg/dl. The electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray results were also normal (). No premedication was provided, and the patient's vital signs were measured immediately after entering the operating room (OR); BP was 120/80 mmHg, HR was 50 beats/min, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) was 99%. Due to the facial injury, facemask ventilation was thought to be difficult to perform and hence, manual assisted ventilation, using rapid-sequence induction, with O2 of 5 L/min was performed and, 450 mg of thiopental and 80 mg of succinylcholine were injected intravenously one after another. After tracheal intubation, manual assisted ventilation was performed with 2.0 vol% of sevoflurane.\nImmediately after tracheal intubation, BP increased from 120/80 to 160/90 mmHg and HR rose from 50 to 120 beats/min, and premature ventricular complexes (PVC) were detected on ECG. Therapy for ventricular arrthymias was intitated with a 70 mg of lidocaine intravenous injection, but the ventricular arrhythmias changed into patterns of ventricular bigeminy, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and torsades de pointes subsequently; BP measured at that time was 60/30 mmHg. Immediately, the administration of sevoflurane was discontinued and manual assisted ventilation was performed with 100% O2, while an external cardiac defibrillator was being prepared for attempting defibrillation. As an intravenous injection of esmolol was being prepared, ventricular fibrillation (VF) without measurable BP was detected. Instantly, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by chest compression was performed. As early defibrillation was attempted using 360 J, chest compression was resumed and 1 mg of epinephrine was administered intravenously. Thereafter, VF on ECG disappeared, and the heart rhythm returned to its normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Considering it difficult to proceed with the operation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) as soon as the patient's vital signs stabilized and normal spontaneous respiration was confirmed.\nAfter the patient was transferred to the ICU, arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) and electrolyte studies were conducted and the results showed a pH of 7.334, PaCO2 of 44.8 mmHg, PaO2 of 70.1 mmHg, base excess -2.7 mmol/L, HCO3- 23.3 mmol/L, SaO2 of 93%, Na+ 142 mmol/L, K+ 4.2 mmol/L, Cl- 103 mmol/L, Ca2+ 1.16 mmol/L, and Mg2+ 1.7 mg/dl; which were within their normal limits. However, chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema, while ECG detected a T-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF, and V2-6, and QTc prolongation to 547 ms (). On ultrasound, akinesia of the anteroseptum & inferoposterolateral wall of the left ventricle was detected, and in coronary angiography, the left ventricular ejection fraction was 38% demonstrating hyposystole, and an increase in the left ventricular cavity size to 60 mm were detected, while there were no other abnormalities seen. Thereafter, ECG was recorded daily on a continous basis with Holter monitor. Epinephrine provocation test was positive and hence the patient was diagnosed with LQTS. On the fifth day of admission, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. Afterwards, the patient's vital signs improved and were within their normal ranges and the QTc intervals on ECG also showed normalization. Hence on the twelfth day of admission, open reduction of the fractured zygomatic bone on the right side was performed under general anesthesia.\nIn the preoperative evaluation, blood tests showed findings within their normal ranges. On ECG, T-wave inversion persisted in leads II, III, and aVF. Normal T-waves were seen in V2-6 and the QTc of 406 ms was also within its normal limits (). As a premedication, 2.5 mg of midazolam was injected intravenously at the entrance of the OR. On arrival in the OR, vital signs were measured: BP 110/75 mmHg; HR 85 beats/min; SpO2 95%. Before induction of anesthesia, preoxygenation was performed with 6 L/min of O2, and propofol administration was initiated with an effect-site concentration of 4.0 \u00b5g/ml using a target-controlled infusion device (Orchestra\u2122, Fresenius Vial S.A, France). Afterwards, 0.15 \u00b5g/kg/min of remifentanil, a useful opioid, was continuously injected intravenously, loss of consciousness was confirmed. Following complete muscle relaxation by an intravenous injection of 70 mg of rocuronium, tracheal intubation was performed. BP recorded immediately after intubation was 100/60 mmHg, and HR was 75 beats/min. After the patient's vital signs stabilized, propofol was infused with an effect-site concentration of 2.5-3.0 \u00b5g/ml, and continuous remifentanil infusion was given at a rate of 0.05 \u00b5g/kg/min to 0.10 \u00b5g/kg/min. During anesthesia, no particular changes were noted in BP and on ECG. The left radial artery was catheterized to monitor the arterial pressure. Similarly, HR, ECG, SpO2, end-tidal CO2, etc. were monitored, but they did not reveal any particular changes. After completion of the operation, muscle relaxation was reversed immediately with an infusion of glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg and pyridostigmine 10 mg. After confirming normal spontaneous respiration and consciousness, the patient was extubated and when his vital signs were found to be stable, he was transferred to the recovery room (RR). The total time exposed to anesthesia was 3 hours and 45 minutes. In the RR, the patient was in a stable condition and after he fully recovered from the anesthesia, he was transferred to the general ward. On the nineth postoperative day, the patient was discharged without any complications. What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

    "question": "A 63-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our department because of an abnormal shadow at the left side of her chest wall on computed tomography. She had undergone total hysterectomy and radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma 4 years prior. One year after the first surgery, three metastatic lung nodules appeared at the upper lobe of her right lung, the lower lobe of her right lung, and the lower lobe of her left lung. Wedge resection for upper and lower lobe of her right lung was initially performed via three-port thoracoscopic surgery. Then, wedge resection for the lower lobe of her left lung was performed via eighth intercostal single incisional thoracoscopic surgery. After the surgery, an intrathoracic chest wall mass developed which increased in size gradually. Her gynecologist introduced her to our department for surgical resection of the mass. Her family, including her parents and two sisters, had been healthy and had no inheritable diseases. She had no symptom, drug history, tobacco smoking history, or psychosocial history, and she was a social drinker. She had not received any medications since the mass developed and until admission to our hospital. She had undergone an operation three times as mentioned above and had been a carrier of type B hepatitis.\nAfter her admission to our department, her general condition was good, and there were three operative scars at both sides of her chest and lower abdomen. Her chest sounds were clear and there was no neurological abnormality. She was 151.1 centimeters tall and weighed 49.8 kilograms. Her heart rate was 77/minute, blood pressure was 135/87 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.1 \u00b0C. The laboratory findings were white blood cells 5.25 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, and platelets 156 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL. A liver function test revealed: albumin 4.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 15 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 13 U/L, and total bilirubin 0.3 mg/dL. A renal function test revealed blood urea nitrogen 13.6 mg/dL and creatinine 0.79 mg/dL. An electrolyte test revealed sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, and chlorine 106 mEq/L. A tumor marker test revealed carcinoembryonic antigen 3.4 ng/mL and squamous cell carcinoma antigen 0.80 ng/mL. Another test revealed positive reaction to type B hepatitis surface antigen and C-reactive protein < 0.1 mg/dL. Computed tomography demonstrated a gradually increasing low-density mass measuring 2.0 \u00d7 1.8 cm in diameter (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a low-intensity mass in T1-weighted imaging and a high-intensity mass in T2-weighted imaging (Fig. ). The mass was thought to be a singular cyst; however, this type of cyst was rare and the mass was increasing. Therefore, dissemination of cervical carcinoma could not be excluded, and surgical removal of a part or tissue of the mass was performed.\nIn the right lateral position, thoracoscopic excision of the mass was done with two ports (3 mm and 2 cm access ports) by two general thoracic surgeons (Fig. ). First the 3 mm port was set at the sixth intercostal space on the inframammary line. Most of her left lung was attached to her chest wall; therefore, the second port was set above the cyst and lysis of adhesions was done. After the lysis, the cystic mass was found adhering to the upper lobe of her left lung. The adhesion of the mass to her lung was not strong and could be separated without injury to the visceral pleura. Therefore, the mass was thought to derive from the chest wall pleura and was resected by adhesiolysis.\nThe mass was a unilocular cyst containing mucinous fluid. On microscopic examination, the cyst was lined with a single layer of cuboidal epithelium (Fig. ); immunohistochemistry showed positive staining of calretinin and D2-40 (Fig. ). Thus, the cyst was diagnosed as mesothelial cyst derived from the chest wall pleura. Five years after the surgery, our patient had no evidence of cyst or cervical carcinoma on computed tomography.

    "question": "A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination. She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.\nUpon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th\u201375th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th\u201375th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5\u20133.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4\u201348 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.\nA right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm \u00d72.2 cm\u00d72.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()\nPostoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up.

    "question": "A 76-year-old woman with a history of bronchial asthma complained of edema. She had been diagnosed with thrombocytosis due to ET 3 years earlier. Her condition was stable at diagnosis, but edema occurred 2 months later, upon which administration of hydroxyurea was initiated.\nThe patient\u2019s height, weight, and blood pressure were 150 cm, 50 kg, and 180/80 mmHg, respectively. She was alert and appeared healthy. She did not have any remarkable heart, lung, or abdominal abnormalities. Pitting edema was demonstrated in her lower extremity.\nThe laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin, 15.8 g/dl; hematocrit, 47.3 %; platelets, 490,000/\u03bcl; white blood cells, 8,100/\u03bcl, C-reactive protein, <0.2 mg/dl; blood urea nitrogen, 25.7 mg/dl; serum creatinine, 1.2 mg/dl; total cholesterol, 182 mg/dl; total protein, 5.9 g/dl; albumin, 3.1 g/dl; globulin, 2.8 g/dl; lactate dehydrogenase, 241 IU/l; aspartate aminotransferase, 18 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase, 12 IU/l; total bilirubin, 0.3 mg/dl; \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, 25 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase, 284 IU/l; Na, 141 mmol/l; K, 4.8 mmol/l; and Cl, 109 mmol/l. Urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria and 2+ hematuria.\nRenal biopsy was performed (Fig. ); 13 glomeruli could be evaluated, 2 of which exhibited global sclerosis. Moderate mesangial proliferation with several crescents and arteriolosclerotic changes were observed. Immunohistological staining was positive for IgG and IgA with a granular pattern and negative for IgM, C1q, C3, and fibrinogen. Electron microscopy showed electron-dense deposits in the mesangium. The patient was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy with an active lesion, and treatment consisting of 30 mg prednisolone, 50 mg cyclophosphamide, and 80 mg telmisartan per day was started. Although treatment improved the proteinuria and hematuria, the patient\u2019s serum creatinine level remained unchanged. Telmisartan decreased her blood pressure, but her hematocrit level could not be normalized. The patient experienced a complicated acute myocardial infarction 3 years later. She died 5 years later from ischemic bowel disorder and heart failure. What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L.",

    "question": "A 12-day-old female infant presented with a history of poor sucking and was hospitalized for further examination of hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. She had been born at full term with a birth weight of 3,326 g and had shown no symptoms at birth. When she was brought to our hospital, her weight was 3,339 g. As the skin turgor and capillary refill time were normal, no obvious dehydration was observed. Neither hyperpigmentation of the skin nor virilization of the external genitalia was observed. Laboratory test results were as follows: serum sodium: 134 mEq/L; serum potassium: 6.2 mEq/L; serum glucose: 72 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 12 mg/dL; and creatinine: 0.49 mg/dL. Metabolic acidosis was not noted. Urinalysis results were normal. Urinary sodium and potassium levels were 12 mmol/L [fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) was 0.68%] and 16 mmol/L [fractional excretion of potassium (FeK) was 1.98%], respectively (Table ). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed mild hydronephrosis [Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) grade 1] in the left kidney (Figure ). The infant\u2019s feeding was dramatically improved by administering intravenous saline. The serum sodium level increased to 137 mEq/L; however, the serum potassium level was still above 6.0 mEq/L. Hormone evaluation results were as follows: adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): 50.3 pg/mL; cortisol: 25.4 \u03bcg/dL; plasma renin activity (PRA): 36.7 ng/mL/h; and aldosterone: 1,678.2 pg/mL (Table ). PRA and aldosterone levels were markedly elevated, suggesting profound tubular resistance to aldosterone. Hence, we suspected the presence of S-PHA with hydronephrosis.\nOn day four of her admission (16 days since birth), oral sodium chloride supplementation, as well as calcium polystyrene sulfonate, was started. However, the serum potassium level increased to 6.7 mEq/L, and an electrocardiogram revealed the peaking of T waves. Hydrocortisone (50 mg/m2) was intravenously administered, and the serum potassium level rapidly decreased to 5.4 mEq/L on the following day. With a presumptive diagnosis of CAH, we continued treatment with hydrocortisone. The infant\u2019s electrolytes remained normal on follow-up. However, a mass screening test performed on day four showed a very low concentration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP; direct method) of 2.0 ng/mL. To exclude a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, we performed a urine steroid profile analysis for further consideration. During that time, we continued steroid administration along with oral hydrocortisone. The patient was temporarily discharged on day 22 of admission (34 days since birth) and was prescribed oral hydrocortisone of 6 mg/day, sodium chloride supplementation of 1.0 g/day, and calcium polystyrene sulfonate of 2.0 g/day (Figure ). We confirmed that the urine steroid profile was normal, and steroid administration was gradually decreased. At six months of age, we discontinued all drugs after confirming that there had been no recurrence of electrolyte abnormalities and that there were no symptoms induced by high renin or high aldosterone levels. The patient is currently one year old. She has been followed up with no problems noted other than the continued but mild hydronephrosis. What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L.",

    "question": "A 63-year-old male patient was admitted through the emergency department with a 2-month history of watery diarrhoea of 6\u201310 stools a day, abdominal pain that woke him up at night, anorexia and weight loss of 10 kg. No fever or other symptoms were reported. He had been previously medicated with ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for possible small bowel bacterial overgrowth without improvement. The patient had also undergone a colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which were both normal.\nThe patient had history of arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia and had been medicated with olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 mg once daily for 10 years, atenolol 100 mg once daily, lercanidipine 20 mg once daily, clonidine 0.15 mg three times daily, and simvastatin 20 mg once daily. He lived in the countryside and drank well water that was not submitted to microbiological tests. He had no history of allergies, alcohol intake, contact with animals or recent travels abroad.\nAt admission the patient was conscious with normal vital signs. His weight was 99 kg with a body mass index of 29.89 kg/m2. Abdominal examination was unremarkable and no peripheral oedema or adenopathies were present.\nBlood tests revealed a haemoglobin of 14.4 g/l, white blood cells of 10.04\u00d7109/l, C-reactive protein of 0.16 mg/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 18 mm, albumin of 4.4 g/dl, sodium of 137 mmol/l, potassium of 3.7 mmol/l, low folic acid (2.5 mg/dl) and normal liver enzymes (). Abdominal ultrasound was normal. The patient was discharged to the outpatient clinic and was treated with metronidazole on the assumption he had a protozoal infection, without improvement. He lost another 5 kg, developed hypoalbuminaemia of 2.9 mg/dl and hypokalaemia with a need for oral supplementation. An extended study was then performed.\nLaboratory evaluation revealed thyroid function, cortisol level, protein electrophoresis, antinuclear antibodies and coeliac auto-antibodies were all normal. HIV and viral hepatitis tests were negative. Fasciola, Entamoeba and Giardia serological tests were negative, and gastrin and VIP levels were normal ().\nBacteriological, mycobacteriological, parasitological and clostridium stool tests were negative. Stool osmolarity was normal, and tests for reducing sugars and fat were negative.\nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopy was macroscopically normal with histology of duodenum (D3) biopsies showing moderate villous atrophy (). Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy including biopsies was normal. Thoracic, abdominal and pelvic CT scans were normal.\nAt this point the patient had lost a total of 20 kg and his blood pressure had dropped, so atenolol and clonidine were suspended. Simvastatin was also suspended. A gluten-free diet was initiated with no improvement, and fasting and a cholestyramine trial were attempted, also without improvement.\nFollowing a literature review, olmesartan-induced enteropathy was suspected and the drug was halted. Two days later the diarrhoea stopped, the patient gradually gained weight, and the hypoalbuminaemia and hypokalaemia resolved. After 2 months, the patient had regained his normal weight. Interestingly, the patient restarted olmesartan autonomously due to his disbelief in the presumed aetiology, only for the symptoms to recur with diarrhoea restarting after 2 days of therapy and ceasing again 1 day after its discontinuation.

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency unit complaining of limb numbness and watery diarrhoea (8\u201310 bowel movements/day) which started 2 weeks earlier. The patient reported a weight loss of about 10 kg in the last 2 months in the absence of hyporexia. Her clinical history unravelled microcytic anaemia treated with oral iron replacement. Physical examination showed severe weakness of the limbs with a bilaterally positive Trousseau\u2019s sign without cardiorespiratory abnormalities. Vital parameters were within the normal range. The abdomen was flat, without tenderness, while auscultation disclosed increased intestinal sounds. Her ECG showed a sinus rhythm with type 1 atrioventricular block, flat T waves associated with U waves and an elongated QTc interval (570 ms). Laboratory tests revealed severe electrolyte imbalance, with hyponatraemia (133 mmol/L), hypokalaemia (1.6 mmol/L), hypocalcaemia (ionised calcium of 0.9 mmol/L), hypophosphataemia (1.6 mg/dL) and hypomagnesaemia (1.4 mmol/L). Furthermore, the patient had hypochromic microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin of 85 g/L, with a mean cell volume of 68 fL and a mean cell haemoglobin of 20.6 pg), normal platelet count (297\u00d710\u02c69/L), iron (serum iron 18 \u00b5g/dL; ferritin 2 ng/mL) and folate deficiency (2 ng/mL), as well as hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia (total serum protein 4.4 g/dL; albumin 2.6 g/dL). Due to severe electrolyte imbalance, a conspicuous electrolyte replacement was rapidly administered, leading to a slight improvement in electrocardiographic abnormalities. The patient was then admitted to the internal medicine ward for adequate investigation and treatment. During the hospitalisation, the common causes of infectious diarrhoea were excluded by stool cultures, and the faecal occult blood test resulted negative. Both ultrasound and abdominal X-ray examinations were unremarkable. Liver function tests revealed a slight increase of transaminases, with alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase values of 47 U/L and 60 U/L (n.v. 5-35 for both parameters), respectively. Based on the lack of fever, normal C reactive protein and the presence of non-bloody, watery diarrhoea, the patient was further evaluated with an upper endoscopy. The examination revealed stigmata of villous atrophy at the duodenal level (), where biopsies were taken from the bulb and the second portion. Histopathological analysis showed the presence of a severe villous atrophy (Marsh-Oberh\u00fcber grade 3c) () without any evidence of aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes. Based on the histopathological result, we used enzyme-linked immunoassay to test IgA anti-TG2, which turned to be positive at low titre (23 U/mL, n.v. <10 U/mL). This result was associated with the positivity of IgA antiendomysial antibodies (1:80) revealed by indirect immunofluorescence. The genetic test showed human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 positivity. Therefore, a firm diagnosis of CD was established and the patient started a gluten-free diet (GFD). Due to rapid improvement after gluten withdrawal, a course with steroid treatment was deemed not necessary. Since diarrhoea and paraesthesia showed significant improvement with complete regression in about a week, the patient was discharged in good health.

    "question": "A 2-month old boy was admitted to our primary clinic because of poor weight gain, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Initially, he was thought to have electrolyte abnormalities caused by dehydration and discharged without an exact diagnosis. When he was 6 years old, he manifested voice change, acne, testicular enlargement, and premature pubarche. His height and weight were 124 cm (2.31 SDS) and 27 kg (2.63 SDS), respectively. The volume of each testis was 7 mL, the stretched penile length was 7 cm, and his bone age was 13 years by Greulich and Pyle's method, which was remarkably advanced for his chronological age. His serum 17-hydroxypregnenolone (17-OHP) and testosterone levels were elevated to 480 ng/mL (normal range: 0.32-3 ng/mL) and 2.0 ng/mL (normal range: 0.03-0.1 ng/mL), respectively. He was diagnosed with precocious puberty caused by CAH. He was treated with hydrocortisone (15 mg/m2/day) and 9\u03b1-fludrocortisone (0.1 mg/day). However, he did not take medicine after 11 months of treatment. At age 17 years, he visited our outpatient clinic because of bilateral testicular enlargement and short stature. He was scheduled to be treated by surgical resection of testicular tumors because testicular biopsy demonstrated large, polygonal, and eosinophilic cells with round nuclei and prominent nucleoli, which are consistent findings with Leydig cell tumors (). His height and weight were 155.1 cm (-2.90 SDS) and 68 kg (0.49 SDS), respectively, and body mass index (BMI) was 30.2 (>97th percentile). He was normotensive (110/70 mmHg). His right and left testicles measured 10\u00d76 cm, 7.5\u00d74.5 cm, respectively (), with both being of firm consistency. His pubic hair Tanner stage was grade V. Gynecomastia and skin hyperpigmentation were noted. Radiography of left hand and wrist showed a closed epiphyseal plate. His serum 17-OHP concentration was 506.20 ng/mL (normal range: 0.32-3 ng/mL), ACTH level was 187.6 pg/mL (normal range: 2-49 pg/mL), plasma renin activity was 20.0 ng/mL/h (normal range: 0.4-8.8 ng/mL/h), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) level was 270.6 \u00b5g/dL (normal range: 30-555 \u00b5g/dL). He had an androstenedione level of 18.0 ng/mL (normal range: 0.57-1.5 ng/mL), a luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration of 0.23 mIU/mL (normal range: 1.54-7.0 mIU/mL), a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level of 1.6 mIU/mL (normal range: 1.54-7.0 mIU/mL) and a testosterone level of 6.13 ng/mL (normal range: 3.5-9.7 ng/mL). His serum sodium and potassium concentrations were 141 mmol/L and 4.1 mmol/L, respectively, and serum \u03b1-fetoprotein and \u03b2-hCG levels were 1.4 ng/mL (normal range <20 ng/mL) and 1.0 mIU/mL (normal range <5 mIU/mL), respectively. Abdominal computerized tomography revealed a 1.5 cm-sized adrenal adenoma on the left side and focal adrenal hyperplasia on the right side. Mutation analysis of CYP21A2 revealed a compound heterozygote, c.293-13A>G and c.1066C>T (p.R356W). To reduce the size of his tumors and to improve his hormonal profile, he was prescribed ACTH suppressive therapy with dexamethasone (0.25 mg tid). After 3 weeks, the tumors markedly regressed. The volume of each testis estimated using a Prader orchidometer was 25 mL (). His serum 17-OHP and ACTH concentrations had decreased to 1.0 ng/mL and 9.4 pg/mL, respectively, and serum testosterone concentration was reduced to 0.05 ng/mL (normal range: 3.5-9.7 ng/mL). He was switched from dexamethasone to prednisolone (5 mg twice a day) for maintenance, which had no effect on the volume of his testes. Following the switch, 17-OHP concentration was 19.8 ng/mL, ACTH concentration was 45.3 pg/mL, plasma renin activity was 20.0 ng/mL/h, and testosterone level was 3.0 ng/mL.

    "question": "This was a 2-month-old male patient who was born at term with a birth weight of 3450 g. He was the second child of non-consanguineous Chinese parents. Since 2 weeks old he was admitted to local hospital due to recurrent vomiting, diarrhea, poor feeding, dehydration, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Prompt therapy with sodium chloride (NaCl) and 5% dextrose as well as sodium bicarbonate infusion were initiated, then the patient was transferred to our unit for further investigation.\nPhysical examination (PE) on admission showed: weight of 4 kg (\u22121SD), length of 55 cm (0 SD), no dehydration, no hyperpigmentation, and normal external genitalia. The laboratory findings were as follows: Plasma Na 130 mmol/L (Normal Range [NR] 135 ~ 145 mmol/L), K 6.86 mmol/L (NR 3.5 ~ 5.0 mmol/L), Cl 104 mmol/L (NR 96 ~ 106 mmol/L), Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 3.37 pmol/L (NR 1.6 ~ 13.9 pmol/L), cortisol < 5\u03bcg/dl (NR 5 ~ 20\u03bcg/dl), plasma renin activity (PRA) 1019.2 pg/ml (NR adult 4 ~ 24 pg/ml, neonatal renin 2.5\u201320 times higher than adult []), and plasma Ald 117.0 pg/ml (NR infants 1-12 months 50-900 pg/ml []). Further analysis showed plasma testosterone (T), progesterone (P), Androstenedione (A4), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels were in the normal range. Urinalysis and CT scan for adrenal and renal were also normal. Patient was treated with fludrocortisone (Fc) 0.1 mg/day along with sodium supplementation 2-3 g/day. Since 6-month-old his mother had stopped sodium supplementation. FC dose had been reduced from 1.5 years old till 1.67 years old and was then fully discontinued by his parents.

    "question": "A ten-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with complaints of cough, fever, vomiting, weakness and lack of appetite. She also suffered from alopecia and persistent/recurring respiratory infections. Both parents were reported to be healthy and they were consanguineous (first cousins). Their four children except for our patient were healthy.\nPhysical examination of the patient revealed normal vital signs. The percentiles of her weight and height were between the 3rd and 10th percentiles. She had pale skin, total alopecia and pitting in the nails of her hands and feet (). A crackling sound was heard during inspiration. Her puberty was stage I according to Tanner stages.\nHer hematology results revealed a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, hematocrit 19.9%, white blood cells 13200/mm3, platelets 35000/mm3, MCV 84fL and reticulocytes of 8.14%, as well as negative direct Coombs test result. Blood smear showed schistocytes (). Her biochemical investigation revealed: urea 142 mg/dL, creatinine 4.61 mg/dL, AST 97 U/L, ALT 79 U/L, LDH 2218 U/L, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.55 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 5.9 mmol/L, chloride 109 mmol/L, calcium 8.7 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.0 mg/dL, uric acid 8.0 mg/dL, ph 7.44, HCO3- 21 mmol/L and glucose 76 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed the following: pH 7.5, density 1010, protein (++), erythrocytes (+++), leucocytes (-) and dysmorphic erythrocytes in the urinary sediment.\nBased on these biochemical and urinary abnormalities, the patient was diagnosed as HUS. After seven plasma exchange sessions, the hemolysis finally stopped and the laboratory abnormalities and renal function reverted to normal. The respiratory infection was treated with appropriate antibiotic regimens.\nIn the hormonal evaluation, free thyroxine (fT4) was 1.11 ng/dL (0.8-2.2), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 3.028 mU/mL (0.6-5.5), anti-peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody 62 IU/ mL (<20), anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) antibody 65 IU/mL (<4.0), cortisol 25.5 mg/dL (3-21), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 28.1 pg/mL (10-60), estradiol 14 ng/dL (0.2.0), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 0.32 mIU/mL, luteinizing hormone (LH) 0.07 mIU/mL (0.02-0.3), anti-pancreatic islets antibody 1/100 (<1/10), parathyroid hormone (PTH) 65.9 ng/mL (10-65), renin 72 ng/L (5-35), aldosterone 248 pg/mL (20-300), vitamin B12 456 pg/mL (150-883) and folic acid 4.2 ng/mL (3.1-20.5) before plasma exchange therapy. Although thyroid ultrasonography was normal and the patient was not on Na-L-T4 treatment, both anti-TPO antibody and anti-TG antibody tests were positive. These findings suggested early diagnosed autoimmune thyroiditis. Cortisol response to ACTH stimulation test (1 \u03bcg ACTH) was as follows: initial 1 mg/dL, 30th minute 8.1 mg/dL, 60th minute 11.2 mcg/dL, 90th minute 14.1 mg/dL, and 120th 14.7 mg/dL. The cut-off level of this test was 14 mg/dL (9). These results were interpreted as a normal response to ACTH stimulation test and indicated that there was no adrenal insufficiency. In immunological evaluation, IgA was 24 mg/dL (29-384), IgM 24 mg/dL (50-278), IgG 464 mg/dL (625-1579), IgE 464 IU/mL (0-170), C3 90 mg/dL (90-180), C4 26 mg/dL (10-40), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) (-), anti-double strain DNA antibody (-), p-ANCA (-), c-ANCA (-) and anti-HBs (-) before plasma exchange therapy. Lymphocyte subsets were CD3 78% (55-78), CD19 2% (10-31), CD4 39% (27-53) and CD8 51% (19-34). The complement factor H gene region was proliferated by PCR method. Sequences which have single nucleotide polymorphism on complement factor H have been determined. CT homozygote polymorphism for His402Tyr was detected. This factor is considered to be a risk factor for development of HUS (). In radiological evaluation, pulmonary X-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltration and abdominal ultrasonography was normal except for hepatomegaly and grade I increase in renal echogenicity.

    "question": "An 11-year-old boy brought to the ED with a history of sudden onset of bright red urine at the end of micturition (terminal hematuria) with small blood clots that started three hours prior to his presentation. He had associated painful micturition and urgency. There was no history of fever, flank pain, vomiting, trauma, body edema, or ingestion of medications or any type of red-colored food. Two weeks prior to his presentation, he had diarrheal illness without blood in his stool, which resolved spontaneously. He sought medical advice at that time, but no stool culture was taken. When he presented with blood in his urine, he had no current diarrhea. The child is an otherwise healthy boy with no history of recurrent urine or other body site infections in the past. He had no previous history of gross hematuria. No petechia, ecchymosis, or bleeding from other orifices. He underwent a routine circumcision as a neonate. His growth and development are appropriate for his age. There is no family history of hematuria, kidney or urological disorders, malignancy, bleeding, nor immunodeficiency disorders.\nOn examination, he looked well and hydrated. His body temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, heart rate was 76 beats/minute, and his blood pressure was 103/60 mmHg. He was not in pain. He had no edema or skin rash, and his abdomen was soft with no distension, tenderness, or organomegaly. Local examination revealed normal male genitalia with no local signs of infection or inflammation.\nUrine analysis showed cloudy urine with a light orange color and urine pH of 8.5, specific gravity of 1.017, negative for glucose, negative for ketones, +3 blood, leukocyte esterase 500, negative nitrite, and +3 protein. Urine microscopy showed >30 red blood cells per high power field, five to 10 white blood cells per high power field.\nHis initial blood work showed prothrombin time was 12.3 seconds, partial thrombin time was 30.3 seconds, international normalized ratio of 1.03, white blood cell count of 9.8 x 109/L with cell differential count of neutrophils 7.35 x 109/L. His lymphocyte level was 1.60 x 109/L, eosinophils were 0.04 x 109/L, basophils were 0.03 x 109/L, and monocytes were 0.70 x 109/L. Blood chemistry showed serum sodium levels at 137 mmol/L, potassium at 4.1 mmol/L, chloride at 105 mmol/L, HCO3 at 23 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen at 3.5 mmol/L, and creatinine at 52 \u03bcmol/L. The rest of the blood work showed a hemoglobin level of 148 g/L, platelet count of 356 x 109/L, and blood glucose levels of 105 mmol/L.\nA midstream urine sample was collected two different times, and both samples were sent for culture before starting antibiotics. Both cultures were incubated and grew more than 100,000 colony forming units per ml of Gram-negative bacteria. Afterward, the identification and susceptibility test showed Salmonella Nontyphi species. It was sensitive to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. No further serotype identification was made due to a lack of test kit availability.\nRenal ultrasound showed a urinary bladder wall thickness of 0.3 cm in a full bladder with luminal mobile echogenic foci at 2 cm x 1.3 cm. Otherwise, both kidneys were healthy in size, echogenicity, and corticomedullary differentiation with no hydronephrosis or ureteronephrosis (Figure ).\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and was started empirically on intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, which was continued for four days until the final urine culture result was assessed. Then, the patient was discharged home to complete three more days on the same antibiotic.\nThe patient was seen one month after discharge for follow-up; he was doing well with no gross hematuria episodes and no microscopic hematuria in urine analysis. The urology team saw him, and the plan was to consider cystoscopy if he became symptomatic again with another UTI. He was last seen seven months after the treatment of Salmonella UTI, and he was doing well with no recurrence of infection in the urinary tract. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A previously healthy 23-month-old boy presented to our hospital with a 2-day history of fever, postprandial diffuse abdominal pain, and non-bilious vomiting (>5 episodes/day) that began 1 day before admission. After admission, the patient developed a watery diarrhea. In addition to food refusal, he was observed to produce lesser urine than usual upon void review. His medical and birth history were unremarkable (he was not administered any medications, he had no known allergies, and his immunizations were up to date). His family medical history was unremarkable, and he had no travel history at that time.\nUpon examination, the patient looked acutely ill and dehydrated. He was 90.2 cm (in the 75\u201385th percentile) tall and weighed 11.6 kg (in the 15\u201325th percentile). His abdomen was soft and flat with normoactive bowel sounds. Upon palpation of the abdomen the examination revealed the existence of a mild tenderness over the entire abdomen, without rebound tenderness or muscle guarding or rigidity. The rest of his physical examination was noted to be normal. The patient's vital signs showed a heart rate of 141 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 with a normal respiratory pattern, temperature of 38.6\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 98% on room air. He was observed to be mentally alert at the time of the examination. The initial laboratory tests revealed the following: white blood cells (WBCs) 6,500 cells/\u03bcL, hemoglobin (Hb) 13.2 g/dL, platelets 423,000/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 6.35 mg/dL, sodium 130 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, chloride 90 mmol/L, and total carbon dioxide 14.4 mmol/L. All other blood tests were within the reference range. His stool occult blood test was positive (748 ng/mL). It is noted that the tests for rotavirus and norovirus antigen were negative. An erect chest X-ray did not show pneumoperitoneum; however, an erect abdominal X-ray demonstrated abnormal dilatation of the small bowel loops with air-fluid levels suggestive of possible SBO (). The abdominal ultrasonography revealed mild wall thickening of the small bowel loops suggestive of acute enteritis, several enlarged lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant, and a normal-appearing proximal appendix (the tip of the appendix was not visualized), without any evidence of mechanical bowel obstruction such as an intussusception.\nThe patient was resuscitated using normal saline and received conservative management. At that time, cefotaxime was empirically administered intravenously. The following day, his condition rapidly deteriorated, and he developed a state of septic shock. Upon examination, the patient's vital signs now were: blood pressure (BP) 87/39 mmHg, heart rate 170 bpm, respiratory rate 56, temperature 38.1\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation 93% on room air. Our surgical team urgently came to the patient and performed physical examination; his abdomen was soft with mild tenderness and slight muscle guarding on palpation. They recommended continuing medical supportive care, but frequent physical examinations needed to be performed to detect subtle changes in the patient's signs and symptoms. The patient's laboratory tests were repeated and revealed: WBCs 5,300 cells/\u03bcL, Hb 9.7 g/dL, platelets 186,000/\u03bcL, CRP 28.96 mg/dL, sodium 129 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 95 mmol/L, and albumin 2.6 g/dL. Upon review, the coagulation tests revealed an abnormally prolonged prothrombin time at 21.5 seconds and an activated partial thromboplastin time at 56 seconds. The patient's venous blood gas analysis demonstrated metabolic acidosis: pH 7.28 and bicarbonate 15 mmol/L. Upon review, other blood tests remained within reference range. A plain abdominal X-ray was repeated and showed worsening of small bowel ileus. At that time, an urgent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT was performed in order to confirm the presence of a surgical abdomen. The imaging revealed diffuse dilatation of the large and small bowel loops (suggestive of paralytic ileus) with uniform enhancement of bowel wall and no lead point of bowel obstruction, mesenteric lymphadenitis, and mild ascites (). However, the radiologists were of the view that obstructive ileus could not be completely ruled out in this case. They did not find an abnormal appendix, but the condition of an acute appendicitis could not be excluded either. The patient was maintained on a nil per os status, and fluid resuscitation was continued. We tried rectal tube decompression, however, his condition did not show much improvement except the passage of small amount of rectal gas. He received albumin, packed red blood cells, and fresh frozen plasma intravenously. At that time, Metronidazole was additionally administered empirically, and his vital signs were closely monitored for any significant changes.\nOn the third hospital day, the patient became more lethargic despite medical therapy. His BP was observed to have normalized; however, it was noted that tachycardia and tachypnea persisted. On repeated physical examination, his abdomen now showed distention with hypoactive bowel sounds, however, muscle guarding or tenderness could not be clearly ascertained on palpation. The patient developed generalized edema and oliguria. Based on the patient's clinical condition, we decided to perform an urgent exploratory laparotomy at 44 hours after admission.\nUpon opening the peritoneum, approximately 400 mL of ascitic fluid was drained. Next, a segment of markedly dilated and infarcted small bowel was identified 30 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve (). It is noted that the total length of the necrotic small bowel was approximately 60 cm. The omentum and the colon appeared to be intact. Upon review, the small bowel intussusception or volvulus was not identified. Even at laparotomy, our surgical team could not find the lead point of bowel obstruction. The appendix appeared unremarkable macroscopically. In this case, after decompression of the bowel following an incision on an infarcted small bowel segment, 110 cm of the distal small bowel containing the necrotic segment was resected and end-to-end small bowel anastomosis was performed in addition to a prophylactic appendectomy.\nHistopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed multiple areas of mucosal necrosis with diffuse congestion. The patient blood cultures did not reveal any bacteria, and stool cultures did not reveal Salmonella or Shigella. His postoperative course was considered to be uneventful, and oral nutrition could be initiated on postoperative day 5. The patient was discharged in a good general condition on postoperative day 11. After discharge, the patient was noted as asymptomatic and did not report any serious residual complications. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 73-year-old Caucasian male presented to the hospital for acute renal failure secondary to diarrhea and dehydration. The patient was found to have C. difficile infection which was treated with oral vancomycin and Flagyl. He had a past medical history of diabetes on metformin, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, all diagnosed in the last six months before presentation. Family history was significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) in his brother at an unknown age. There was no family history of hematological malignancy or autoimmune disorders. There was no history of chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. The patient denied any history of smoking or recreational drug use. He used to drink alcohol occasionally and worked in a coffee factory all his life. There was no history of radiation exposure.\nUpon presentation, the patient's basic metabolic panel showed creatinine of 15, sodium of 140, potassium of 5.6, chloride of 106, blood urea nitrogen of 95, calcium of 9.2, and bicarbonate of 20. Complete blood count showed a WBC count of 8.3X103/\u03bcL, neutrophils 74%, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 253 X103/\u03bcL. Renal biopsy was done which showed acute tubular injury with an increased number of calcium oxalate crystals and arteriolosclerosis. It also showed low-grade large B-cell lymphoma immunophenotypically most consistent with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of MALT, involving approximately 10% of the kidney tissue. Immunohistochemistry of the kidney tissue showed CD 19, CD20 positive B cells, that were negative for CD5, CD10, CD23, CD200, CD38, and MYD 88. The Ki-67 proliferative index was low.\nCT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no bowel obstruction or appendicitis or acute inflammatory change. Non- obstructing right renal lithiasis was found. No hydronephrosis or obstructive uropathy was noted. No lymphadenopathy was noted on the CT. Autoimmune workup including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) was negative. HIV and hepatitis panel, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, were nonreactive.\nA positron emission tomography (PET) scan (Figure ) showed uniform activity in renal parenchyma with no other significant hyper-metabolic activity or lymphadenopathy.\nBone marrow biopsy showed normocellular marrow involved by low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma consistent with marginal zone lymphoma, approximately 10%-15% involvement. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow aspirate showed approximately 33% of lymphocytes that were monotypic B-cells, expressing CD19, CD20, CD22, CD45, and showed lambda light chain restriction. The B-cells were negative for CD5, CD10, CD23, CD200, and CD38.\nThe patient was started on dialysis, and he remained on intermittent hemodialysis three times a week for two months. However, his renal function improved without any treatments and interventions for his MZL. The patient eventually came off dialysis. Since the patient now remains completely asymptomatic, he did not receive any treatment for his MZL. The patient will follow up in a lymphoma clinic in three months with a repeat CT abdomen pelvis for close monitoring of his disease. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 16-year-old female with a five-day history of headache, fever, persistent vomiting, and complete loss of vision in both eyes was referred to the Ophthalmology unit from the children's emergency room of Abia State University Teaching Hospital. One month prior to presentation, she noticed a gradual, painless reduction in vision which was ignored.\nThe eye examination findings were as follows:\nVisual acuity was no light perception in both eyes. A left divergent squint was noted with defective inward movement of the left eye. Also noted was a right nasal subconjunctival haemorrhage. Both corneas were clear. Both pupils were markedly dilated and not reactive to light (). On fundoscopy/slit lamp examination, there was a white pupil, marked disc, and retina oedema. () Soft and hard exudates were seen, left hazy media, and a macular scar was noted. The intraocular pressure (IOP) were 37mmHg and 28mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively.\nA diagnosis of ocular hypertension, and bilateral ERD was made, secondary to CRF and hypertensive complications. Senior Loken syndrome was the differential diagnosis.\nA B-mode ocular ultrasound was requested.\nShe was placed on gutt 0.005% latanoprost/0.5% timolol, a drop in each eye, nocte; gutt 0.1% brimonidine, a drop in each eye, twice daily; gutt 0.1% diclofenac, vitreolent (0.3% potassium iodide and 0.3% sodium iodide) and 0.1% flurometholone, a drop in each eye, q.i.d.\nThe latanoprost/timolol and brimonidine are ocular antihypertensives used for the reduction of the IOP. Diclofenac was used for pain and inflammation. Fluorometholone is a low dose steroid used for its anti-inflammatory properties.\nShe was reviewed by the physicians and the following parameters were noted:\nOn presentation, her metabolic status showed the level of urea: 40.7 m/l (2.4\u20138.3), creatinine: 11.92mg/dl (0.6\u20131.1), potassium: 6.7 (3.4\u20135.2), chlorine: 91 (96\u2013107), sodium: 133 (138\u2013149), bicarbonate: 14 (24\u201330). Random blood sugar 245mg/dl; the urine specific gravity was 1.020, PH was 6.0, protein +++. Blood+++.\nThe systemic blood pressure (BP) was 220/140mmHg (>99 percentile for age). Systemic hypertension was managed with amlodipine 10mg daily, lisinopril 10mg daily, and intravenous furosemide 20mg daily. The hemoglobin level was 7g/dl on admission and she was transfused with 6 units of whole blood all through her stay in the hospital. A dialysis regimen of 3 times weekly was also recommended.\nThe B-mode ocular ultrasound scan showed normal sized and shaped globes. ( and ) The anterior chambers and the lenses were normal. There were thick echogenic membranes which are V-shaped, attached to the optic disc and ora serrata in the vitreous body on both sides. There were scattered ill-defined collections of slightly echogenic particles as well as a freely mobile membrane in the left vitreous body. The optic nerve shadows were normal. There was limited medial movement of the left eye. The movements of other extraocular muscles were within normal limits. An impression of bilateral retinal detachment with left-sided vitreous hemorrhage was made.\nA renal ultrasound scan showed bilateral small kidneys measuring 8.61cm \u00d7 3.4cm and 8.31 \u00d7 4.28cm on the right and left sides respectively (). (Normal kidney sizes for her age are 10.74\u00b11.35cm and 11.0 \u00b11.15cm on the right and left side, respectively.) There was a grade 3 increase in renal parenchymal echoes with the loss of corticomedullary echo differentiation. There were no renal cysts, calculi, or calyceal dilatation. Also noted was pelvic ascites. A diagnosis of bilateral chronic renal parenchymal disease with pelvic ascites was made.\nShe was discharged on request one month after admission and was placed on a weekly follow-up at the pediatric outpatient clinic.\nIn the third month of follow up, the ophthalmic review showed improvement of left eye visual acuity to hand movement. There was a reduction in the IOP to 35mmHg and 23mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. This recording was after her fourth hemodialysis. At this time, the systemic BP was 160/100mmHg.\nThe patient was inconsistent with hemodialysis due to financial constraints. She had only six hemodialysis treatments over seven months, prior to her demise. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 47-year-old man arrived to the emergency room due to generalized tonic-clonic seizures and altered mental status. He had a history of long-standing uncontrolled type 2 diabetes treated irregularly with insulin and metformin (HbA1c 10.1%), with no known microvascular or macrovascular complications. He had no history of alcohol consumption and twenty-four hours earlier he referred nocturia, polyuria and polydipsia. On the day of admission, while asleep, he suddenly developed three consecutive episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures along with urinary sphincter loss and subsequent postictal state.\nOn physical examination he was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, temperature 36.5\u00b0C, and room-air oxygen saturation of 98%. His body mass index was 32.2. Mucous membranes were remarkably dry. The patient was lethargic and had a Glasgow coma scale of 11/15, muscle strength was 4/5 in both lower extremities, and deep tendon reflexes were diminished. Cranial nerves were normal, sensitivity was preserved, and meningeal signs and primitive reflexes were absent. Due to the patient status cerebellum function could not be evaluated. Finger-stick glucose could not be recorded due to high blood glucose levels and venous blood gas analysis reported pH 7.36, PCO2 42 mmHg, PO2 32 mmHg, lactate 1.2 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 23.7 mEq/L. Urinary and plasma ketones were negative. Hydration with intravenous normal saline solution at 500 mL/h and an insulin infusion at 0.14 U/kg were started. Plasma glucose was 838 mg/dL (46.5 mmol/L), blood nitrogen urea 21 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL with a MDRD calculated glomerular filtration rate of 71 mL/min, serum sodium 133 mmol/L, and chlorine 89 mmol/L. Calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, hemoglobin, white blood count, and platelets were all within normal limits. Serum albumin was 2.1 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase 192 UI/L, alanine aminotransferase 19 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 21 U/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, and serum osmolality 320 mOsm/kg ().\nHead computed tomography, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray were normal. The patient after 24 hours of treatment continued with altered mental status and paraparesis progressed (3/5). Plasma glucose was lowered down carefully at a rate of 30\u201340 mg/dL/hr and was within 200\u2013300 mg/dL []. Serum osmolality dropped down to 305 mOsm/Kg (). Twenty-four hours after admission a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered and revealed increased signal intensity on T2-weighted FLAIR images with restricted diffusion in the medulla and central pons (). Mammillary bodies, thalamus, third ventricle, and both hemispheres were respected. Lumbar puncture was normal, electroencephalogram showed a nonspecific wave activity, and urinary and serum toxicology panel were negative. During all his admission serum sodium was documented to be within normal range. ODS was diagnosed and aggressive supportive therapy was started. During the next 3 weeks the patient progressively regained consciousness and muscle strength and was able to feed himself. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and MRI showed no residual damage. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "Mild proteinuria had been incidentally detected in a 22-year-old woman during a regular health check-up 2 years prior to presentation. She visited a local clinic for a follow-up check. She took medication to treat hyperlipidemia for 1 year and did not take any other drugs including diuretics or laxatives. She was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of persistent mild proteinuria.\nThe prenatal course was unremarkable. On physical examination, her height was 153 cm, her body weight was 49 kg and her blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg. No edema was found, and normal muscle strength and reflexes were noted. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. The laboratory examination revealed blood urea nitrogen of 10.9 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.68 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mmol/L, potassium of 2.59 mmol/L, chloride of 94.7 mmol/L, magnesium of 2.05 mEq/L, and bicarbonate of 31.2 mEq/L. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C4 were normal. Anti-nuclear antibody was negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.007, trace protein, pH 8.0, and no red blood cells. The spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was 0.95 g/g creatinine. Abdominal sonography revealed normal-sized kidneys, without nephrocalcinosis or stones. Plasma renin activity was elevated at 27.98 ng/mL/hr (normal range, 0.50 to 1.90 ng/mL/hr in a supine position), but serum aldosterone was 13.2 pg/mL within normal limits (normal range, 1 to 16 pg/mL in a supine position). The urine prostaglandin E2 level was elevated at 2,815 ng/day (normal range, 400 to 620 ng/day). These findings suggested BS or pseudo-BS/GS caused by vomiting or diuretics.\nLight microscopy of renal biopsy demonstrated 14 glomeruli, two of which were globally sclerotic. Most glomeruli appeared moderately increased in size and cellularity due to prominence of the mesangium and JGA. Five glomeruli showed marked enlargement with hyperplasia () and hypergranulosis of the JGA (). The mesangium was diffusely expanded due to mild to moderate increase in cells and matrix (). There was moderate tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with infiltration of lymphocytes. The interlobular arteries and arterioles displayed mild to moderate intimal fibrous thickening and medial sclerosis. Immunofluorescence revealed weak positive (1+) staining for IgG, IgA, and fibrinogen and trace (+/\u2013) of staining for C3 and lambda in the mesangium (). Electron microscopy revealed mild increase in the mesangial cells and matrix with rare small mesangial electron-dense deposits and hyperplastic juxtaglomerular cells with increased electron dense renin and progranules ().\nGenetic analysis revealed a homozygous deletion of exon 1\u201314 and heterozygous deletion of exon 15\u201319 in the CLCNKB gene (). Her father had heterozygous deletion of exon 1\u201314 (), and her mother had heterozygous deletion of all examined exons of the CLCNKB gene (). However, her parents displayed no renal symptoms or abnormal renal function. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "An 11-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder controlled on Trileptal, learning disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and pica presented with altered mental status and vomiting. She was ill with fever, cough, nausea, and anorexia for two weeks prior to presentation and had completed a five-day course of azithromycin to treat atypical pneumonia. On the morning of presentation, she had multiple episodes of emesis and an inability to tolerate oral intake, which prompted evaluation in the emergency department.\nIn the emergency department, she was found to be lethargic and hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 70s on room air. Vital signs showed a temperature of 36.8\u00b0C, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/71 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. She was placed on high-flow nasal cannula 20 liters per minute and 0.5 FiO2. Physical examination showed a lethargic child in no acute distress. Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II-XII intact, and normal speech, motor, and sensation examinations. Respiratory effort was normal, and there were end-expiratory rales bilaterally. She was mildly tachycardic with regular rhythm and normal distal perfusion. Abdominal examination was benign without hepatosplenomegaly.\nInitial laboratory evaluation showed venous blood gas of pH 7.39, pCO2 of 65 mmHg (8.64 kPa), and HCO3 of 40 mEq/L (40 mmol/L). Chemistry was significant for sodium of 130 mEq/L (130 mmol/L), chloride of 87 mEq/L (87 mmol/L), bicarbonate of 37 mEq/L (37 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28 mg/dL (10 mmol/L), and creatinine of 0.57 mg/dL (43.46 \u00b5mol/L). Liver enzymes were increased with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1,396 U/L (23.31 \u00b5kat/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1,003 U/L (16.75 \u00b5kat/L). Urine drug screen was negative. Chest X-ray, as read by the radiologist, revealed bilateral perihilar opacities with no focal infiltrate (Figure ). On admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, she was escalated to BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) support, but due to progressive alteration in mentation, she was orally intubated for acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Shortly after intubation, she was awake, alert, and requested a quick extubation.\nAfter extubation, repeat physical and neurologic examinations were nonfocal with normal cranial nerve function. However, it was noted that her carbon dioxide levels continued to rise. During the day, she could be coached to take deep breaths to lower her carbon dioxide level. At night, her carbon dioxide levels rose to 96 mmHg (12.8 kPa), which could only be controlled with noninvasive ventilation. Multiple studies including drug screen, thyroid studies, lead levels, hepatitis screen, cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and cultures, and urine electrolytes were sent and normal. Encephalopathy panel revealed N-type calcium channel receptor, for which the patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin. Head imaging with CT and MRI were normal. On further history taking, it was revealed she had significant intellectual impairment and tremendous daytime somnolence with failing school performance. In combination with the fact that most laboratory studies were negative or unrevealing and that she had no respiratory drive in response to hypercarbia, genetic studies for CCHS were sent on day 2 of hospitalization and resulted positive for heterozygous c.765_779dup PHOX2B gene variant on day 22 of hospitalization.\nAfter the diagnosis of LO-CCHS was made, a multi-disciplinary team including pulmonology, neurology, otolaryngology, social work, and child life met with the family to discuss treatment options. After discussing options with the family and patient, she had a tracheostomy placed and was discharged on invasive mechanical ventilation only during the night time and at times of rest. She had improvement in lab values following tracheostomy placement, as venous blood gas revealed pH of 7.40, pCO2 of 43 mmHg (5.7 kPa), and HCO3 of 26.4 mEq/L (26.4 mmol/L). Chemistry results were as follows: sodium of 135 mEq/L (135 mmol/L), chloride of 98 mEq/L (98 mmol/L), bicarbonate of 33 mEq/L (33 mmol/L), BUN of 10 mg/dL (3.57 mmol/L), and creatinine of 0.2 mg/dL (15.25 \u00b5mol/L). She was discharged home after 43 days of hospitalization.\nAt home with tracheostomy ventilation at night time, she has done remarkably well with significant improvement in mental status and excessive daytime tiredness. Her end-tidal carbon dioxide has been maintained between 35 to 45 mmHg (4.7 to 5.9 kPa) with normalization of her acid-base balance. She has returned full-time to school and has accelerated to the top 25% of her class within eight months of treatment. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 52-year-old white male with O2-dependent COPD, hypertension, GERD, idiopathic gastroparesis, and chronic low back pain was noted to have persistent hypokalemia in the 2.7\u20133.3 meq/L range over more than 2 years. He complained also of chronic generalized weakness and fatigue. He denied nausea or vomiting, but did have occasional loose stools. The hypokalemia persisted despite discontinuation of diuretic treatment for hypertension and fludrocortisone that had been prescribed briefly for orthostatic hypotension. There was no improvement with aggressive oral potassium supplementation in amounts up to 120 meq per day. The patient's serum potassium level normalized on three occasions when he was hospitalized and given supplemental potassium (COPD exacerbations in 7/06 and 1/07, pseudoseizures in 7/07), but the hypokalemia promptly recurred after discharge from the hospital (Figure ). His medications were paroxetine, trazodone, pregabalin, sustained-release morphine, loratadine, isosorbide mononitrate, lisinopril, metoprolol, simvastatin, omeprazole, metoclopramide, potassium chloride, calcium/vitamin D tablets, alendronate, and mometasone, tiotropium, and albuterol inhalers. He smoked one-half pack of cigarettes per day and did not drink alcohol.\nOn physical examination, he was a chronically ill-appearing man wearing a nasal cannula. Height was 69 inches, weight 205 pounds. There were no cushingoid facies, buffalo hump, or abdominal striae. Vital signs were temperature 98.6 degrees, pulse 95, respiratory rate 14, blood pressure 128/73. There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. Lungs showed decreased breath sounds and mild expiratory wheezes bilaterally. Heart sounds were regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, with no masses or organomegaly. Extremities showed no edema, clubbing or cyanosis. The neurologic examination revealed mild generalized muscular weakness (4+/5) and normal deep tendon reflexes.\nLaboratory results include serum sodium 137 mg/dL, potassium 3.0 mg/dL, chloride 95 mmol/L, CO2 30.0 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 5 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, calcium 9.3 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.1 mg/dL, albumin 3.6 g/dL, ferritin 126 ng/mL, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, white blood cell count 10.6 K/cmm, and platelet count 160 K/cmm. Serum aldosterone was 4.8 ng/dL (normal 4\u201331 ng/dL) and the plasma renin activity was 0.33 ng/mL/hr (normal 1.31\u20133.96 ng/mL/hr upright, 0.15\u20132.33 ng/mL/hr supine). Spot urine potassium was 8.6 mEq/L, urine sodium was < 10 mEq/L, and urine chloride was 16 mmol/L.\nIn the absence of a clear explanation for this patient's chronic hypokalemia, he was asked to give the details of his diet. He admitted to drinking 4 liters of Pepsi-Cola per day for the past several years. It was his habit to sip cola slowly but almost continuously, throughout the day. When hospitalized, he had stopped drinking cola and his potassium levels had temporarily normalized. In early May 2008, he decreased his cola intake to 2 liters per day, with a resultant increase in the serum potassium from 3.0 to 3.5 mg/dL (Figure ).

    "question": "A 91-year-old Puerto Rican man presented for evaluation of progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past six months associated with two weeks of productive cough of yellowish sputum. The patient also had complaints of fatigue, palpitations and dyspnea with minimal exertion. His past medical history was significant for pulmonary tuberculosis in 1969 for which he received approximately 24 months of medical treatment. The patient also had a history of coronary artery disease, bronchiectasis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and has had multiple exacerbations of his bronchiectasis and COPD which did not require hospitalization. He had a history of smoking 30 cigarette packs per year but discontinued cigarette smoking 45 years prior to his admission. He denied alcohol or drug use and had no history of prior surgeries. He had been followed by a pulmonologist for over seven years, and spirometry testing done four months before his presentation showed an forced expiratory volume1 (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of 64%, FEV1 of 71%, and FVC of 84%. One year prior to presentation, an echocardiographic assessment demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate pulmonary hypertension, and a dobutamine stress echocardiogram demonstrated a defect in the inferior wall consistent with a previous infarction.\nOn physical examination, the patient was tachycardic at a heart rate of 140 beats per minute, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and saturating oxygen at 94% on atmospheric air. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented to person, time, and place and able to speak in full sentences. He did not demonstrate jugular venous distention, but his trachea was deviated towards his right side. There was no evidence of stridor. The patient\u2019s breath sounds were diminished bilaterally with more prominently diminished sounds over his right lung fields. Coarse rhonchi were notable over his right lower lung. No wheezing or rales were appreciated. Heart sounds were more prominent on the right side of the chest and were characterized as an irregular tachycardia, with no murmurs, gallops or accentuated heart sounds appreciated. Laboratory studies demonstrated a white blood cell count of 7100/mm3, hemoglobin level 9.1g/dL, hematocrit 28.0%, sodium 137mEq/L, potassium 4.0mEq/L, chlorine 101mEq/L, bicarbonate 30mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 16mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.6mg/dL, glucose 140mg/dL, troponin I: 0.03ng/mL, B-type natriuretic peptide 320ng/L, and normal liver and kidney function. Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.480, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 46, partial pressure of oxygen of 116 and an oxygen saturation of 99% on two L of oxygen. An electrocardiogram showed a multifocal atrial tachycardia without T wave or ST segment changes (Figure ). A chest X-ray demonstrated opacification of the right hemithorax with a marked mediastinal shift to the right and hyperinflation of the left lung (Figure ). A computed tomography scan of the patient\u2019s chest showed hyperinflation of his left lung, cystic bronchiectasis, mediastinal shifting to the right with clockwise rotation of his trachea and marked absence of normal lung parenchyma in his right lung (Figures , ). Venous Doppler ultrasound of his lower extremities was negative for venous thrombosis. The patient\u2019s presentation was attributed to a cardiac arrhythmia secondary to his extensive lung disease and was treated with calcium channel blockers to control his heart rate. However, four days into his hospital course, he became lethargic with a three gram drop of his hemoglobin and subsequently went into cardiac arrest. The patient was immediately intubated and was resuscitated according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocol. During the arrest he was noticed to have profound coffee ground emesis. Despite resuscitation efforts, the patient remained pulseless and subsequently died. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "An 85-year-old woman called an emergency medical service (EMS) for hematochezia. Her medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic constipation, and chronic low back pain. Her medications were apixaban 5 mg/day in 2 doses, furosemide 40 mg/day, bisoprolol 10 mg/day, and perindopril 10 mg/day. Her height was 150 cm and weight 42 kg (body mass index 18.7 kg/m2). She lived at home with her husband and was completely independent with acts of daily life.\nA basic life support ambulance was dispatched. When they arrived, the ambulance crew noted cyanosis in bilateral hands and feet. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented to place, person, and date, and conversant, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. She had been complaining of tiredness, anorexia, and constipation for 8 days and blood in her stools. Blood pressure was 130/40 mmHg, heart rate 143 beats/min, respiratory rate 14 cycles/min, and temperature 37 \u00b0C. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was hard to measure with a high variability of the results displayed on the oxymeter. A medical team (advance life support ambulance with an emergency physician on board) was sent for additional support.\nWhen the medical team arrived on the scene, the medical history found that hematochezia had started within the last 24 h, but was also associated, in the past several days, with melena and diffuse abdominal pain. The clinical examination showed signs of tissue hypoperfusion with skin mottling of the lower limbs, peripheral vasoconstriction, increased capillary refill time, and peripheral cyanosis. The skin was very pale. Blood pressure was 112/40 mmHg, heart rate 86 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 cycles/min, temperature 37 \u00b0C, and SpO2 remained difficult to measure due to severe peripheral vasoconstriction. Placed at the ear, the oxymeter was able to show an SpO2 of 90% while the patient was on oxygen at 9 L/min via mask. The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with inverted T waves in V4, V5, and V6. The hemoglobin, measured twice on a capillary and venous point of care sample, was 5 g/dL. Capillary blood glucose, controlled three times, was not measurable despite the normal level of consciousness of the patient.\nManagement consisted of oxygen at 9 L/min via high flow mask, intravenous catheterization and rapid intravenous fluid infusion with 500 mL of isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl), and intravenous administration of 12 g of glucose with a 30% glucose solution. Anemia correction was deferred. Thirty-nine minutes after the medical team arrival, the patient was transported to an intensive care unit (ICU).\nAt the hospital, the symptomatology was unchanged. Laboratory results were are follows (normal values in parentheses): pH 7.30 (7.3\u20137.42), pCO2 30 mmHg (35\u201345), pO2 297 mmHg (> 90), bicarbonate 15 mmol/L (22\u201326), sodium 140 mmol/L (136\u2013145), potassium 5.0 mmol/L (3.7\u20135.2), chloride 108 mmol/L (95\u2013105), glucose 5.9 mmol/L (3.8\u20136.1), lactate 0.56 mmol/L (0.60\u20132.00), creatinine 251 \u03bcmol/L (55\u2013100), and urea 45.1 mmol/L (2.5\u20137.5). Hematology was as follows: leukocytes 19,000/mL (4000\u201310,000), red blood cells 1,980,000/mL (4,000,000\u20135,2000,000), hemoglobin 4.8 g/dL (12.5\u201315.5), and platelets 324,000/mL (150,000\u2013400,000). The prothrombin level was 39% (70\u2013125). The apixaban anti-Xa was 484 ng/mL.\nTherapies consisted of 50 IU/kg of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate to reverse apixaban, transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells, and 3 units of plasma. An esogastroduodenal fibroscopy did not show any lesions. A colonoscopy visualized, in the left angle and in the sigmoid colon, an ischemic colitis with ulcerations responsible for the bleeding in the previous days. No active bleeding was seen. The final diagnosis was hemorrhagic shock secondary to intestinal bleeding on ischemic colitis in the context of apixaban overdose, itself complicated by acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis.\nDuring the remainder of the patient\u2019s stay in the ICU, there was no hemorrhagic or hypoglycemia recurrence, the acid-base balance was restored, and the kidneys recovered normal function. The patient was discharged to the internal medicine department on day 10. Her mental status was closely monitored and remained normal throughout her hospital stay.

    "question": "A 24-year-old man was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) with a possible diagnosis of seizure disorder and sepsis. He had a past medical history of cerebral palsy and spastic quadriparesis. Three years ago, he had an ITB pump implanted for spasticity refractory to the high doses of oral baclofen. He had a significant improvement in spasticity, social and functional capacity in the past three years.\nLater, he developed some disorientation and increased spasticity. He was taken to a local physician who prescribed oral baclofen (120 mg daily in four divided doses) for his increased spasticity. He also advised him to have his ITB pump checked immediately. The following day, his spasticity increased even after taking oral baclofen. He developed multiple seizures and respiratory distress in the next 24-hour period. Subsequently, he was admitted in a local hospital where he was orally intubated and transferred to our ICU for aggressive management.\nOn presentation, his temperature was 104.6\u00b0F (40.3\u00b0C), heart rate 127 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 85/45 mm/Hg. His ventilator settings were: assist-control ventilation mode; respiratory rate, 15 breaths per minute; tidal volume, 650 mL; positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), 5 cm H2O; and FiO2, 60%. His spontaneous respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% was noted on pulse oximetry. In the local hospital, he was documented to have a high fever of 107\u00b0F (41.6\u00b0C) and he had received intravenous lorazepam, phenytoin, pantoprazole, piperacillin/tazobactem and dopamine. On physical examination, neurologically he was unconscious with decerebrate posturing and his Glasgow coma scale was 6. He had an absent corneal and gag reflexes. He was moving all four limbs in response to noxious stimuli. He was also noted to have an extreme spasticity in all four limbs. Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lower base. Cardiac examination was unremarkable. He had a palpable baclofen pump on abdominal wall and bowel sounds were heard. The differential diagnoses were septic shock, meningitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant hyperthermia.\nThe initial laboratory results showed serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) 5250 U/L (Normal, 25\u2013235 U/L) and CPK-MB fraction 12.1 ng/ml (Normal, 0.5\u20136.3 U/L). Serum chemistry revealed sodium 142 mmol/L, potassium 5.1 mmol/L, chloride 120 mmol/L, bicarbonate 13 mmol/L, and creatinine 2.1 mg/dl. Hemogram showed white blood cell count 12.2 K/UL, hemoglobin 16.5 g/dl and platelet count 9 K/UL (Normal, 130\u2013400 K/UL). Liver function test showed aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) 1128 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (AST) 1140 U/L, alkaline phophatase 90 U/L, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dl, conjugated bilirubin 0.7 mg/dl, prothrombin time 20.2 seconds (Normal, 10\u201312.5 seconds), and INR 2.0 (Normal, 0.9\u20131.1). Blood and urine cultures were obtained. Chest radiograph was normal. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed atelectasis of the left lung base. His CT scan of head did not show any acute infarct or bleeding. His initial management included intravenous fluids, norepinephrine, platelet transfusion, phenytoin, propofol and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone) for suspected meningitis and septic shock. He received intravenous lorazepam (4\u20138 mg every four hours) for his spasticity. Next day, his spasticity improved and an ITB specialist investigated his baclofen pump. His baclofen pump analysis revealed that it was stopped due to some programming error, which was restarted at a previously prescribed baclofen rate (260 \u03bcg/day).\nOn third hospital day, his serum CPK was 15,878 U/L, AST was 2566 U/L, ALT was 2993 U/L, while CPK-MB fraction came down to 3.4 ng/ml. His urine output decreased (<400 ml/ day) and serum creatinine increased in the range of 5\u20136 mg/dl. Later, he was hemodialyzed few times during the course of hospitalization due to acute renal failure. His echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 20\u201325% and severe global hypokinesis. His electroencephalogram did not reveal any epileptogenic activity. He developed full-blown multisystem organ failure with an evidence of shock liver, renal failure, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and myocardial depression. His nutrition was started on nasogastric tube feedings, and proper ventilator care was taken through a tracheostomy tube. His serum baclofen obtained at the time of admission was less than 0.02 \u03bcg/ml (Expected values, 0.08\u20130.4 \u03bcg/ml). After a three-week course of aggressive management in ICU, he was weaned off from the ventilator and his multiple organ shock resolved. At a six-month follow-up, he was observed in a nursing home with his baseline functional, social, and family activities. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 10-month-old boy with a body weight of 9.6 kg presented with progressive lethargy. His past medical history was unremarkable. He had suffered from gastritis 2 weeks before and started vomiting again 2 days before admission. The patient had no fever, excessive sweating or diarrhea, and his urine output was normal. Physical examination revealed a sleepy but easily arousable infant with a heart rate of 160 per minute, a respiration rate of 32 per minute and a body temperature of 37.7\u00b0C. On all four extremities, a blood pressure of 135/95 mm Hg was measured, a value above the 99th percentile (P) by age and height (e.g. P 95th is 103/56 mm Hg). There were no signs of meningitis or intracranial hypertension, no abnormalities in sensibility and strength, and reflexes were normal. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed no heart murmurs, and breath sounds were normal. The abdomen was not painful to palpation and there were no masses. No edema was found, and the skin was unremarkable. Based on the combination of hypertensive crisis and the neurological findings, the diagnosis of malignant hypertension was made and the patient was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit for evaluation and intravenous antihypertensive therapy [, , ]. Nicardipine at 1 mcg/kg/min lowered his blood pressure to an acceptable level of 105/55 mm Hg (P 95th) within a few hours.\nLaboratory results showed a normal complete blood cell count, serum electrolytes (Na 137 mmol/l, K 4.1 mmol/l, Cl 104 mmol/l), creatinine 13 \u00b5mol/l, urea 3.6 mmol/l and glucose 5.6 mmol/l. Glomerular filtration rate was 118 ml/min, and blood lactate as well as ammonia levels were normal. An arterial blood gas analysis revealed a mild meta-bolic acidosis with respiratory compensation (pH 7.40, bicarbonate 17.7 mmol/l, pCO2 29 mm Hg).\nA computed tomography of the brain revealed no intracranial bleeding, no tumor and no signs of elevated intracranial pressure. An abdominal ultrasound showed normal kidneys without hydronephrosis, and Doppler studies were unremarkable. On the ultrasound, an abdominal mass with the characteristic \u2018target sign\u2019 of an ileocecal intussusception was visualized in the right lower quadrant (fig. ). Radiographically guided hydrostatic reduction with water-soluble contrast failed. Laparotomy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of intussusception. After repositioning, intestinal perfusion was adequate and bowel resection was not necessary. The anesthetics used during the surgery had no major influence on the blood pressure. Following surgery, the mental status returned to normal and antihypertensive medication could be discontinued. His blood pressure decreased to a normal level (P 50th 90/40 mm Hg).

    "question": "The patient was a 33-year-old Caucasian male with advanced AIDS (CD4+ cell count: 59 cells/mm3, HIV-1 RNA level of 308,000 copies/mL) and an extensive history of opportunistic infections including prior disseminated histoplasmosis, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) pneumonia, cutaneous varicella-zoster infection, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) gastric ulcer. He had been placed on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with emtricitabine/tenofovir and raltegravir as well as opportunistic infection prophylaxis with itraconazole, azithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), and valganciclovir, although the patient reported being poorly adherent to all prescribed medications. He presented to the hospital with a two-week history of worsening cough, shortness of breath, intermittent fever and chills, and black tarry stools. On admission, he appeared cachectic, chronically ill, and in obvious distress. Vital signs were notable for tachycardia and mild tachypnea. Physical examination revealed facial Molluscum contagiosum, ulcerations on the right lateral tongue, oropharyngeal thrush, mild diffuse abdominal pain, and moderate hepatosplenomegaly. A complete blood count was significant for pancytopenia with a leukocyte count of 2,800 cells/\u03bcL (93% neutrophils, 4% lymphocytes, and 1% monocytes), hematocrit of 20% (down from the patient's baseline of 30%), and platelet count of 28,000/mL. The results of a comprehensive metabolic panel were as follows: sodium 133 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, chloride 102 mmol/L, bicarbonate 22 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 16 mg/dL, creatinine 0.76 mg/dL, glucose 103 mg/dL, calcium 7.7 mg/dL, AST 113 units/L, ALT 25 units/L, and alkaline phosphatase 450 units/L.\nOn the evening of admission, the patient became febrile to 39.5\u00b0C and increasingly tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic requiring supplemental oxygen, several liters of intravenous fluids, and two units of packed red blood cells. A chest radiograph was obtained which showed a diffuse miliary pattern concerning for PCP pneumonia and/or disseminated opportunistic infectious process such as tuberculosis, MAC, or fungal infection. He was started on empiric treatment with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, high dose TMP/SMX, prednisone, ethambutol, azithromycin, and liposomal amphotericin B. He responded well to broad-spectrum treatment over the next few days and subsequently underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). BAL cultures returned positive for H. capsulatum. The patient also underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) given his persistent melanotic stools and progressively declining hematocrit (nadir of 18%) requiring multiple blood transfusions. EGD was significant for a well-healed scar on the greater curvature of the stomach from prior CMV gastric ulcer and new diffuse erosions throughout the second, third, and fourth segments of the duodenum (). Multiple biopsies were taken which showed duodenal mucosa with granulomatous inflammation. Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) stain identified macrophages with small intracellular yeasts consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis (). Bone marrow involvement was also suspected in light of the patient's significant pancytopenia, but he had previously refused bone marrow biopsy. Urine Histoplasma antigen came back markedly elevated at >39 ng/mL (above the upper limit of detection for this particular assay) confirming the diagnosis, and the patient was treated with a two-week course of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B followed by indefinite oral itraconazole.\nFollowing a two-week inpatient hospitalization, the patient demonstrated excellent improvement. All major presenting symptoms were resolved, including the melanotic stools, and his hematocrit was stable at his baseline. By the time of discharge, the patient had regained his prior level of functioning including full ambulatory capacity. Several weeks after discharge, sputum acid-fast culture returned positive for MAC for which he was continued on ethambutol and azithromycin. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

He initially was unable to walk out of the bus due to sudden weakness of both lower limbs with marked numbness but no pain and was later supported out of the bus. Initially, swelling was painless but later became mildly painful as the swelling increased in size. He experienced numbness and pins and needles sensation in gloves and stocking distribution for the previous one year. He has no history of intermittent claudication and no frothiness of urine but was said to have experienced deteriorating vision for the previous one year. A known type 2 diabetic diagnosed 11 years ago on account of osmotic symptoms was regular on antidiabetic (metformin,) and subsequently controlled on subcutaneous mixtard insulin.

    "question": "A 29-year-old Caucasian male with an established history of Liddle syndrome, diagnosed at the age of 8, and a 10-pack-year smoking history, presented to a local hospital with the sudden onset mid-sternal chest pain radiating to the back. The chest pain was associated with lightheadedness, headache, diaphoresis, palpitations, nausea, and one episode of non-bloody emesis. Family history was significant for LS in his father, younger brother, and paternal uncle. His father and paternal uncle met an early demise secondary to intracerebral bleeds from elevated blood pressure related to LS. In addition, he also confessed to being non-compliant with his antihypertensive medications for many years. His initial vitals were a temperature of 98.2 F, pulse rate of 83 beats/min, respiratory rate of 19 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and a blood pressure (BP) of 220/120 mmHg. His BP was equal in bilateral upper extremities with strong bilateral pedal pulses. A 12-lead electrocardiogram performed in emergency room revealed evidence of a left ventricular hypertrophy without any acute ST-T wave changes (Figure ).\nGiven his concerning constellation of symptoms and findings on physical examination, a stat computerized tomographic angiogram (CTA) of the chest was performed, which showed an acute penetrating ulcer in the proximal descending thoracic aorta with intramural hematoma extending from the origin of the left subclavian artery into the suprarenal abdominal aorta, consistent with Stanford Type B aortic dissection (Figures -). The intramural hematoma extended to the origin of the celiac artery resulting in a high-grade stenosis (Figure ). CTA of the abdomen and pelvis also revealed fusiform dilatation of the suprarenal abdominal aorta with a maximal diameter of 3.4 x 3.3 cm.\nThe patient was immediately started on intravenous labetalol and nitroprusside drip for heart rate and blood pressure control and was subsequently transferred to our hospital for further management and hemodynamic monitoring. His initial lab work was notable for a sodium of 134 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride of 99 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 19 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 16 mg/dl, and creatinine of 0.84 mg/dl. Routine echocardiography demonstrated a normal ejection fraction of 60-65% with left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient required continuous intravenous infusions of various BP medications, including labetalol, nitroprusside, and nitroglycerin to achieve target BP goals in first 24-48 hours. However, it was not until the patient was started on 20 mg of oral amiloride that he was weaned off some of the anti-hypertensive drips. In addition, the patient also required clonidine, metoprolol, nifedipine, hydralazine, and isosorbide mononitrate to strictly maintain his BP at goal. By Day 3 of his hospitalization, BP control was achieved with an oral antihypertensive regimen as mentioned above and all the intravenous drips were discontinued. The patient remained asymptomatic during the ICU stay.\nA cardiothoracic consultation was obtained and medical management was the initial recommendation. However, on hospital Day 6, a repeat CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed to confirm stabilization of the penetrating ulcer. It revealed that the intramural hematoma in the mid-thoracic aorta had formed a deep penetrating ulcer, in addition to stable fusiform dilatation of the suprarenal abdominal aorta with a maximal diameter of 3.4 x 3.3 cm (Figure ).\nVascular surgery was consulted and the patient underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with the exclusion of the intramural hematoma and penetrating ulcer in the mid-descending thoracic aorta using a Gore\u00ae TAG\u00ae Thoracic Endoprosthesis 26 x 10 (WL Gore & Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ) on hospital Day 8. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on multiple oral BP medications as outlined above after 10 days of hospitalization. The patient followed up in the clinic one month after discharge from the hospital and reported feeling well with no further episodes of chest pain. His blood pressure had been well controlled on multiple oral antihypertensive medications, including amiloride. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

On arrival to the emergency department (ED), he was tachycardic with a heart rate of 101 beats per minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The rest of his vital signs were within normal limits. His physical exam revealed no acute distress; he was awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Skin exam revealed multiple soft cutaneous neurofibromas and cafe au lait spots. Lung auscultation revealed good air entry bilaterally. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs or gallops appreciated. Laboratory test illustrated a white blood count of 15.9 k/ul, hemoglobin of 12.2 gm/dl, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >90 mL/min/1.73 m2, glucose of 66 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 12 mg/dl, creatinine of 0.68 mg/dl, sodium of 136 mmol/dl, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L, chloride of 104 mmol/L, CO2 of 26 mmol/L, calcium of 8.6 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 19 u/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 26 u/l, alkaline phosphatase of 275 u/l.

CT of the chest was positive for left basilar consolidation with surrounding ground-glass opacities and innumerable bilateral thin-walled cysts (Figures , ). The latter finding raised suspicion for neurofibromatosis-associated diffuse lung disease (NF-DLD). On chart review of previous hospital admissions, a CT of the chest from two years ago showed emphysema with scattered fibrosis and scarring, but no cysts were reported. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics were initiated.

    "question": "A 67-year-old man with past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), history of alcoholism, and history of chronic kidney disease stage 3 presented with chest pain for 1 week. Chest pain was intermittent, left sided, 8/10 in severity, non-radiating, dull in nature, exacerbated by exertion and mildly relieved by rest. Remaining review of system was negative. He stopped taking all his cardiac medications for 1 year. Vitals were as follows: blood pressure 130/76 mm Hg, pulse 142/beat per minute respiratory rate 18/min. Pulse oximetry was 97% on 2 L nasal cannula. Cardiac examination was significant for tachycardia with irregularly irregular pulse but no murmur, rub or gallops. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Other system examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory data showed sodium 137 (136 - 145 mmol/dL), potassium 5.1 (3.5 - 5.2 mmol/dL), chloride 105 (96 - 110 mmol/dL), bicarbonate 22 (24 - 31 mmol/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 37 (5 - 25 mg/dL), creatinine 1.85 (0.44 - 1.0 mg/dL), glucose 130 (70 - 99 mg/dL), aspartate transaminase (AST) 176 (10 - 42 IU/L), alanine transaminase (ALT) 208 (10 - 60 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.39, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 6.87 (0.3 - 4.5 IU/mL). Serum troponin was 0.01 (reference value < 0.04 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed 2:1 atrial flutter. Initially patient was given cardizem and \u03b2-blocker boluses but heart rate did not improve. He was loaded with amiodarone 150 mg intravenous push (IVP) over 10 min and continued on amiodarone drip 1 mg/min over 6 h. Heparin drip was started for anticoagulation. On the following day morning labs showed significantly elevated liver enzymes and worsening renal function from his base line on the day of admission. AST was 4,250 (10 - 42 IU/L), ALT 2,422 (10 - 60 IU/L), and INR 2.28. Creatinine was 3.2 mg/dL (0.44 - 1.0 mg/dL), and BUN 44 mg/d reference value (5 - 25 mg/dL). At that moment patient was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure (BP) of 105/55 mm Hg, HR 70 beats per min and pulse ox of 95% on room air. Six hours later, patient became confused and unable to protect his airways. A rapid response was called, and the patient was intubated for airway protection and transferred to intensive care unit (ICU). Amiodarone was immediately stopped. Right upper quadrant ultrasound, a computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis without contrast were normal. Blood cultures, toxicology screen including acetaminophen level, hepatitis panel, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) were all negative. Alpha-1 antitrypsine (A1AT) was 126 (90 - 200 mg/dL), and ceruloplasmin 18 (17 - 54 mg/dL). Hereditary hemochromatosis mutation with C282Y heterozygote and H63D was negative. Patient was immediately started on N-acetylcysteine drip for 72 h. Patient\u2019s liver enzymes continued to rise and peaked at 21,000 (10 - 42 IU/L) for AST and 9,020 (10 - 60 IU/L) for ALT (, ). Total bilirubin increased to 3.9 (, ). INR was 3.8 (day 3 of admission) (). Patient was deemed not a candidate for liver transplant due to history of alcoholism and acute-on-chronic kidney injury. As patient\u2019s kidney function continued to worsen, he was started on hemodialysis (on the fifth day). His platelets count began to drop on day 3. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected and heparin was stopped. Heparin-induced platelet antibodies with reflex to serotonin were positive. Patient was started on argatroban but serotonin release assay came back negative. Patient was successfully extubated to nasal cannula on day 8. LFTs improved and came down AST 79, ALT 192, and albumin of 2.5. INR was falsely high when patient was receiving argatroban () but improved after argatroban was stopped. Kidney function eventually improved, and he did not need more hemodialysis. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "Mr. R.E. is a 72-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which at one point progressed to confusion and slurred speech. Past medical history was most significant for a fall four months previously that resulted in fracture of several ribs on his left side. On presentation he was alert, oriented, and hemodynamically stable with: temperature 36.7\u00b0C, BP 143/83 mmHg, HR 85 beats per minute, RR 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 96% on room air. He denied shortness of breath, fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological examinations were unremarkable. Abdominal examination revealed extreme diffuse pain to palpation and percussion, positive rebound tenderness, but no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. Mucous membranes were dry, and petechiae were observed along the inner left thigh.\nInitially laboratory investigations revealed: hemoglobin (Hb) 138 g/L, white blood cell count (WBC) 14.7\u00d7109/L, neutrophil count 13\u00d7109/L, platelets 28\u00d7109/L, sodium 132 mmol/L, chloride 95 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, bicarbonate 27 mmol/L, BUN 18.6 mmol/L, plasma creatinine 112 \u03bcmol/L, total bilirubin 22.2 \u03bcmol/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1, prothrombin time (PTT) 30 seconds, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 95 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 57 U/L, serum creatine kinase (CK) 807 U/L, troponin-T < 0.01 \u03bcg/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 282 U/L, serum lipase 13 U/L and total amylase 58 U/L. Urinalysis was positive for blood with 20 to 30 erythrocytes per high power field, protein 1.0 g/L and pH of 6.5. A CT of the abdomen with contrast showed the entire spleen to be non-enhancing suggesting complete infarction, which was suspected to be caused by spontaneous embolization of the splenic artery at the hilum (Figure ). No definite active vascular extravasation was seen, however there was soft tissue stranding, a small amount of high attenuating fluid in the perisplenic fat and along the right paracolic gutter, and a small to moderate volume of hemoperitoneum in the pelvis.\nAlthough an atypical presentation, the initial concern was a microangiopathic disorder such as thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Additional investigations for other vasculitic or autoimmune causes showed: C3 complement level 0.55 g/L (normal 0.66 to 1.68 g/L), C4 complement level 0.07 g/L (normal 0.10 to 0.40 g/L), antinuclear antibody (ANA) very weakly positive. pANCA, cANCA and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies were all negative. Direct and indirect Coombs tests, as well as anti-phospholipid IgM and IgG were likewise all negative. Five units of platelets were transfused but it did not increase the platelet count. Thirty-six hours following presentation the hemoglobin remained stable (125 g/L), WBC decreased to 7.5\u00d7109/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 38 mm/h, and C reaction protein (CRP) was elevated at 346.3 mg/L. The peripheral blood smear showed reactive granulocytosis but no evidence of hemolysis, and the patient remained afebrile.\nForty-eight hours after presentation the patient\u2019s condition began to deteriorate with: T 37.8\u00b0C, HR 110, RR 26, oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. The patient had high fever, chills, rigor and low back pain, but physical examination was unremarkable. Platelet count further decreased to less than 10\u00d7109/L, hemoglobin decreased to 109 g/L, serum LDH increased to 306 U/L, and total bilirubin increased to 45.7 \u03bcmol/L along with an increase in creatinine from 74 to 102 \u03bcmol/L. There was no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) given a normal Klaus fibrinogen level at 4.30 g/L, INR 1.1, and PTT 26 seconds.\nOn day three of admission, peripheral blood smears showed some evidence of mild schistiocytes, suggesting the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). Pulmonary condition began to deteriorate, with increased requirement to 6 liters of oxygen per minute producing an oxygen saturation of 88 to 90%. The patient became hemodynamically unstable with a BP 95/58 and experienced decreased level of consciousness. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with evidence of pulmonary edema. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and decreased level consciousness. The nephrology service was consulted and plasma exchange therapy was empirically initiated on the suspicion for TTP as the etiology of his deterioration. Following initiation of plasma exchange, blood culture results obtained on admission to the hospital were found to contain gram-negative rods, and piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 grams IV Q8H was initiated. Two subsequent blood cultures both showed evidence of an unknown gram-negative organism and the patient remained febrile with temperature 39.5\u00b0C. Cardiac echocardiogram did not reveal any valvular vegetation and a head CT scan was also unremarkable. Plasma exchange was stopped on day five of admission due to failure of platelet count to increase with plasma exchange therapy, the presence of gram negative blood cultures, and the degree of thrombocytopenia being largely out of proportion to the level of LDH rise.\nOn day six of admission, the microbiology laboratory reported that the gram-negative organism identified to be a capnocytophaga species based on its fastidious growth and morphology on gram stain (Figures and ). Antibiotic therapy was switched to imipenem 500 mg IV Q6H given reports of some capnocytophaga species being resistant to certain beta-lactams []. Subsequently, on day seven of admission the platelet count increased to 60\u00d7109/L, but the patient continued to be febrile with a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C and WBC count continued to increase to 22.5\u00d7109/L. Due to his persistent confusion and decreased level of consciousness, antibiotic therapy was changed to meropenem 2 grams IV Q6H to decrease the risk of imipenem induced seizure activity. In an attempt to identify the cause of the splenic infarction a trans-esophageal echo was performed, but it did not demonstrate valvular vegetations.\nThe patient\u2019s condition began to improve clinically with meropenem. Fever gradually resolved, platelet count continued to increase, and WBC count began to normalize. Following extubation the patient\u2019s neurological status continued to improve. On further questioning, the patient reported that several days prior to his presentation to the hospital he sustained a cut to his hand while performing automobile repairs. He reports that shortly after sustaining this cut that his dog licked his wound. The patient also reported that he plays with his dog in the evenings on a regular basis and often receives minor bites or scratches to his hands.\nThe patient was discharged home from the hospital on day twenty-one of his admission with no further antibiotic therapy. On discharge his WBC count was 14.2\u00d7109/L and platelets were 295\u00d7109/L. Blood culture samples were sent to the Central Public Health Laboratory, Toronto, Canada and through gene sequencing the organism C. canimorsus was isolated.

    "question": "An 80 year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of repeated twitching in her upper chest and arm. The patient and her family reported that this had been going on for the past three days, however there was no accompanying chest pain. The patient reported a history of asthma, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. The patient also had an automatic implantable defibrillator (AICD).\nOn presentation, these twitches were observed to occur rhythmically and regularly, in approximately 3-5 second intervals, in the bicep, shoulder, and upper chest on her left side. The patient\u2019s skin and soft tissue around the AICD were normal, with no signs of erythema, tenderness, or swelling, and no palpable hematoma.\nHer initial vital signs were: pulse 74 beats per minute; blood pressure 120/54 mmHg; respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute; temperature 36.30C; O2 Sat 97%. Her physical examination was unremarkable except for an AICD in the upper left chest wall. Initial blood work showed a white blood cell count of 7.42 x103/m3, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, sodium 136 mmol/L; potassium 5.4 mmol/L; Cl 103 mmol/L; HCO3 31 mmol/L; BUN 37 g/dL; creatinine 1.86 g/dL; glucose 204 mg/dL; Troponin I <0.02 ng/ml. An electrocardiogram was obtained showing an intermittent atrial pacing at 100 beats per minute, left axis deviation, artifacts, premature ventricular contractions, right bundle branch block, non-specific diffused ST-T changes; and no ST elevations (Figure ).\nUpon consultation with a representative of the AICD manufacturer to interrogate the device, the contractions were noted to be occurring in conjunction with its firing. Supine portable chest x-ray revealed a fractured and coiled lead on the upper portion of the device (Figure ).\nThe AICD device representative reprogrammed the device, ceasing its firing, and accordingly the patient\u2019s muscle twitching ceased. The patient was admitted and care transferred to an electrophysiological cardiologist to remove the fractured wire and replace the AICD. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old man with no medical history presented with headache since the morning and increasing nausea and drowsiness during the day. He became progressively confused in the late afternoon after which his partner consulted a doctor. On arrival at the emergency department he had an epileptic seizure with spontaneous recovery. Neurological and physical examination were unremarkable. Clinically he was euvolemic. CT head showed diffuse sulcal effacement without signs of haemorrhage, basilar artery thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or an intracranial tumour. Venous blood gas analysis, taken minutes after the seizure, showed a pH of 6.89, Pco2 10.8 kPa, bicarbonate 15.4 mmol/L, base excess \u221219.4 mmol/L and a lactate of 18.0 mmol/L. Blood chemistry was remarkable for sodium 131 mmol/L, chloride 82 mmol/L, albumin 51 g/L and an osmolality of 278 mOsmol/kg. The urine toxicology test was positive for acetaminophen but negative for opiates, amphetamines and cocaine. He was then treated with ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, acyclovir and dexamethasone awaiting the results of the lumbar puncture but the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was normal.\nThis prompted us to reconsider the laboratory results. Patients relatively high haematocrit (0.48 L/L), together with the increased albumin level, were suggestive for haemoconcentration. However, we realised that measurements were done in a venous blood sample, which may have been \u2018haemoconcentrated\u2019 by water influx into the muscles during rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, we suggested that his arterial sodium concentration could well be lower, possibly low enough to explain the seizure. And indeed, in an arterial blood gas analysis taken 45 min after the seizure, the plasma sodium level was 118 mmol/L. Analysis of this hyponatremia revealed a urine sodium level of <20 mmol/L and an osmolality of 92 mOsmol/kg. He was diagnosed with primary polydipsia (the polyuria explaining the relatively low urine sodium concentration) and was admitted to the intensive care unit. In the first hours after admission his urine production was over 1 L/hour and the plasma sodium level rapidly increased to 128 mmol/L.\nAfter regaining consciousness he told he had been drinking an excessive amount of water extra throughout the day (4\u20135 L) because he thought that his headache was caused by dehydration. He further explained that he was living a healthy lifestyle in which drinking ample amounts of water played a central role. What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 64-year-old female patient presented to an emergency department with severe shortness of breath and lethargy that was preceded by 3 days of vomiting and reduced oral intake leading to dehydration. She had a recent history of undergoing a gastric sleeve weight loss surgery 4 weeks prior. Her other significant past medical history included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, osteoarthritis, vitamin B12 deficiency, migraines, obesity for which she was treated with the gastric sleeve surgery, in addition to type 2 diabetes mellitus for which she was treated with insulin, metformin, and dapagliflozin. Since she had the surgery she lost 20 kg with insulin dose reductions, while remaining on metformin and dapagliflozin.\nOn examination, she was noted to be tachypnoeac and tachycardiac with heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Her other physical examination including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological systems were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas on presentation showed a pH of 6.93 [7.35-7.45], pO2\u2014151 mm Hg [83-108], pCO2 9 mm Hg [34-45], HCO3 2 mmol/L [22-28], lactate 1.5 mmol/L [<2.2], sodium 142 mmol/L [135-145], potassium 4.3 mmol/L [3.5-5.0], chloride 123 mmol/L [95-110], and glucose of 13.5 mmol/L [4.0-7.8]. Given the modest elevation in glucose, a diagnosis of DKA was not considered at initial presentation, with ketones level not being ordered by the treating physicians. The cause of severe metabolic acidosis was not clear at this stage. She was investigated to exclude ischemic bowel and a computed tomography of her abdomen excluded this.\nHer treatment included rapid rehydration with 3 L of normal saline administered over 3 hours, along with 10% dextrose and normal insulin. She was also given 300 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate intravenously to correct severe acidosis, leading to improvement in pH (see Figure ). She was subsequently admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) for further electrolyte correction and management of DKA. After 10 hours of hospitalization, in ICU her pathology results had improved with pH of 7.27, blood glucose level (BGL) 9.1 mmol/L, but her ketones remained elevated at 6.9 mmol/L while on an insulin infusion at 2 units per hour with potassium replacement of 60 mmol at the standard rate of 10 mmol/h. After review by an endocrinologist, the diagnosis of euglycemic DKA was established and the rate of insulin and glucose 10% infusion increased to 4 units/h and 80 mL/h, respectively, to resolve ketosis. Twenty-four hours into patient's treatment, she was still ketotic with level of 3.7 mmol/L with large requirement of potassium replacement and drop in phosphate level to <0.3 mmol/L [0.75-1.5]. Concurrently, the pH normalized at 7.39 and the patient was planned to be switched to intermediate and short-acting insulin once oral intake was adequate with cessation of oral hypoglycemic therapy including on discharge. Phosphate was replaced by sodium and potassium phosphate 26.4 mmol infused over 2 hours and regular 1000 mg of oral phosphate tablets administered three times a day. By middle of the second day of admission, patient's ketones fell to 0.4 mmol/L, while still on an insulin infusion at 4 units/h dextrose 10% infused at 80 mL/h. Overnight of the second day, patient BGL dropped to 5.7 mmol/L with insulin infusion being stopped while dextrose 10% continued at 40 mL/h with further 60 mmol of potassium administered to target a level above 4 mmol/L. In the morning of the third day, the ketone level has risen to 2.2 mmol/L and potassium level remained at 3.6 mmol/L. On the fourth day of admission, the patient was transferred to a medical ward with further optimization of her insulin dosing regimen by an endocrinologist with initiation of a combination of intermediate and short-acting insulin (Novomix 30\u00ae) at a dose of 6 units twice a day with additional short-acting insulin dose at of 4 units when BGL were above 12 mmol/L. Her BGL was stable at 11.9 mmol/L, and her phosphate levels improved with oral phosphate dosing dropped down to 1000 mg twice a day, and potassium level at 4.5 mmol/L with oral potassium changed from immediate release 14 mmol tablets to slow release 8 mmol tablets. On the eighth day of admission, the patient was discharged home with Novomix 30\u00ae insulin dosed three times a day, 14 units in the morning, 24 units at lunch, and 24 units at night, with an outpatient endocrinology review in the following week.

    "question": "An 18-year-old Black female who had been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, subsequently suffering frequent pain crises and undergoing repeated transfusions, presented to the emergency room with a 21-day history of progressive lower limb oedema accompanied by dyspnoea and orthopnoea. In addition, she reported a 3-day history of severe chest pain, together with a productive cough and fever as high as 38 \u00b0C. She reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, she was found to be very pallid and normotensive (blood pressure, 130/80 mmHg), with a heart rate of 104 bpm, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, as well as being found to have developed anasarca. One month prior, she had undergone outpatient laboratory tests, which had shown that her renal function was normal\u2014with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.75 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease\u2013Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD\u2013EPI) equation, of 134.9 ml/min/1.73 m2\u2014urine analysis showing no haematuria or proteinuria.\nBlood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 6.1 g/dl; haematocrit, 18.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; reticulocyte fraction, 6.11%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 433 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.36 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 18,820 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,630 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 2790 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and urea, 29 mg/dl. The patient showed signs of hyperfiltration, including a serum creatinine concentration of 0.49 mg/dl and a CKD\u2013EPI-determined eGFR of 148.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. A urine sample was found to contain 100 leucocytes/field and 70 erythrocytes/field. In addition, 24-h proteinuria was 8.99 g. Further analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 3.9 g/dl; albumin, 1.2 g/dl; globulins, 2.7 g/dl; total cholesterol, 210 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 114 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 37 mg/dl; triglycerides, 205 mg/dl; C4, 26.1 mg/dl (normal range, 10\u201338 mg/dl); C3, 62 mg/dl (normal range, 73\u2013149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 24.9 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The patient also tested negative for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia and an anti-streptolysin O level of 816 IU/ml (normal range, < 200 IU/ml). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed mild congestion and infiltrate in the right lung base. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.\nGiven the clinical presentation, the diagnostic hypothesis was pneumonia and anasarca due to nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. The patient was started on ceftriaxone (1 g, twice daily). Computed tomography angiography of the chest ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and acute chest syndrome, thus indirectly confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia.\nAfter the infection had been controlled, the patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy revealed 7 glomeruli with global endocapillary proliferation; neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate (Fig. a); synechiae in 10% of the glomeruli; occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane; and a preserved Bowman\u2019s capsule. The tubules were dilated, with foci of epithelial regeneration and neutrophils within their lumina. There was focal oedema in the interstitium. The interlobular arteries had a normal aspect, with intimal proliferation in the arterioles. Immunofluorescence performed on frozen sections showed intensity of deposition of C3 (2+/3+), IgG (1+/3+), IgA (1+/3+) and lambda light chains (1+/3+), with a granular pattern, distributed diffusely throughout the capillary loop. Collectively, the histological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of APIGN accompanied by microangiopathic changes related to the underlying disease.\nTreatment with a diuretic and an anti-proteinuric agent (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was instituted, and the patient evolved to clinical improvement (normalisation of blood pressure, as well as resolution of the proteinuria and haematuria). However, the signs of hyperfiltration persisted even after resolution of the proteinuria. In the final evaluation, the serum creatinine concentration was 0.33 mg/dl and the CKD\u2013EPI-determined eGFR was 187.8 ml/min/1.73 m2. Evolution of laboratorial tests are available in Fig. .

The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory tests at the time of admission revealed an HbA1c level of 9.9%, fasting blood glucose level of 202 mg/dL, insulin level of 15.85 \u03bcIU/mL, and C-peptide level of 2.97 ng/mL. Liver function tests showed an elevated AST level at 47 IU/L and ALT level at 69 IU/L. A lipid panel and comprehensive metabolic panel showed a total cholesterol level of 165 mg/dL, triglyceride level of 104 mg/dL, HDL-C of 50 mg/dL, total protein of 7.6 g/dL, and albumin of 4.8 g/dL (). The free fatty acid level was elevated at 671 \u03bcEq/L.\nThere were no significant findings on a chest radiograph. An abdominal ultrasound showed moderate fatty liver.\nFor glycemic control, combination therapy of oral medication (metformin 500 mg BID) and lifestyle modification through adjustments in dietary habits was prescribed. We evaluated her dietary and nutritional knowledge and then counseled her to consume regular meals with 70\u201390 g of protein per day, maintain daily nutritional requirements of approximately 1800 kcal, and eat a low-carb, low-fat diet. She was recommended to modify her habitual preference of salty and spicy foods, reduce her salt intake, track her meals, and attend outpatient monitoring appointments every 1\u20132 months.\nFor an exercise program, she was instructed to include aerobic and weight exercises that improve muscle strength. She was advised to walk >1 hour at least 5 days per week and visit a health training center for \u22651 hour of strength exercises at least 3 times per week. We measured her height and weight every 2 months, and used InBody720, a type of BIA for accurate assessment of obesity. On diagnosis, patient\u2019s BMI was 29.9 kg/m2 (FMI, 12.7 kg/m2; FFMI, 17.2 kg/m2) and PBF was 42.5%. Two years later after the diagnosis, an abdominal ultrasound showed improvements in her fatty liver and her HbA1c was successfully reduced to 6.0%. The oral medication was discontinued due to the successful glycemic control. At the time, her fasting blood sugar was 97 mg/dL, insulin level was 5.62 \u03bcIU/mL, and C-peptide level was 2.79 ng/mL. Her BMI (FMI+FFMI) was 23.2 kg/m2 (7.0 kg/m2+16.2 kg/m2), which was within the overweight range (85\u201390th percentile), and her PBF was 30.2%. Her BMI at that point was 6.7 kg/m2 lower than that prior to therapy, with a 5.7 kg/m2 reduction observed in her FMI (). Liver function tests and a lipid panel revealed the following: AST, 20 IU/L; ALT, 34 IU/L; total cholesterol, 115 mg/dL; triglycerides, 70 mg/dL; and HDL-C, 30 mg/dL (). The changes in the patient\u2019s weight and body composition during treatment are shown in . Since discontinuing the oral medication, the patient has maintained an HbA1c level <6.5%.

    "question": "A male patient aged four years and 10 months was brought in with a complaint of short stature. It was indicated that although his development was normal until 12 months of age, it halted afterwards. It was found out that the patient was born at term in breech position through cesarean section with a normal Apgar score and birth weight of 3,750 g, hospitalized postnatally for five days due to birth in breech position and was not noted to be hypothermic and hypoglycemic, was diagnosed with LCP at four years of age following detailed examination due to complaints of pain in the hips, and consequently underwent surgery (). Family history indicated that the patient's parents were related to each other within the second degree of consanguinity. His first sibling was being followed up for Tangier disease, and his second sibling was being followed up for hyperlipidemia by the Department of Pediatric Metabolism. Physical examination findings showed that the patient was prepubertal, and that he had a height of 96 cm (standard deviation score [SDS], -3.2), body weight of 14.6 kg (SDS, -1.9), 2 cm shorter left leg compared to right leg, a surgical scar in the left inguinal region, and stretched penile length of 4.5 cm. Other systemic examination findings were normal. While the patient's chronological age was four years and 10 months, his bone age was consistent with a 2-year-old's (according to Greulich and Pyle).\nLaboratory tests yielded the following results: white blood cell count, 11,300/mm3; hemoglobin, 12.1 g/dL; thrombocyte, 320,000/mm3; urea, 7 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.9 ml/dL; serum sodium, 148 mmol/L; potassium, 4.3 mmol/L; chloride, 102 mmol/L; calcium, 9.7 mg/dL; phosphorus, 4.4 mg/dL; normal liver function; fasting blood glucose, 92 mg/dL; total cholesterol, 130 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein, 41 mg/dL; low density lipoprotein cholesterol, 69 mg/dL; triglyceride, 50 mg/dL; and urine density, 1,022 g/cm3.\nDetailed laboratory analyses showed thyroid function consistent with central hypothyroidism (sT4, 0.49 ng/dL [0.8-1.9 ng/dL]; thyroid-stimulating hormone, 2.57 mU/L [0.5-5 mU/L]). The patient was also determined to have hypocortisolemia (basal serum cortisol level of 2.75 g/dL, stimulated serum cortisol level of 5.71 g/dL [with low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone]) and GHD (peak GH values in glucagon and levodopa tests while the patient was euthyroid were 0.257 and 0.46 ng/mL, respectively). Serum IGF-1 level was 15 ng/mL (SDS, -3) and Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) level was 900 ng/mL (SDS, -2.6). An etiology-oriented hypophyseal magnetic resonance imaging was performed due to high prolactin levels (37.4 ng/mL [normal range, 0-25 ng/mL]), which revealed in the sellar cavity center that the adenohypophyseal gland height was 3 mm, neurohypophyseal localization was abnormal, and that there was no signal intensity. In addition, T1A hyperintense nodular appearance with dimensions of 3 mm\u00d72.5 mm showing diffused homogeneous contrast retention following injection of contrast agent was observed at the median eminence level (ectopic neurohypophysis). The pituitary stalk was not identified as a separate structure (). Considering the patient's medical history, it was deduced and evaluated as a pituitary stalk interruption syndrome due to difficult birth. The patient was sequentially started on hydrocortisone, L-thyroxin, and GH therapy. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration? Please outuput your answer in terms of mg/dL.",

    "question": "A 49-year-old African American male presented to our hospital center after ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation achieved after 10 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation by emergency services. Personal cardiovascular risk factors included untreated hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Cardiac past medical history included one episode of diaphoresis and palpitations, four years prior to this admission. Per the patient, workup at that time at another local hospital revealed an unspecified arrhythmia and cardiac hypertrophy, but the patient did not follow up. The patient denied a family history of recurrent syncope or unexplained cardiac death, but reported unspecified cardiac hypertrophy and unspecified arrhythmia in one brother, and coronary artery disease in mother and brother.\nOn arrival to the emergency department, the patient was asymptomatic. Clinical examination showed a blood pressure of 135/67, with irregular heartbeat of 72 beats per minute, decreased heart sounds and soft systolic murmur but no S4 on cardiac auscultation. Troponin-T was minimally elevated at 0.021 ng/mL. Lipid panel was deranged \u2013 cholesterol 239 mg/dL, triglycerides 149 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 170 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 48 mg/dL. Transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase 504 unit/L, alanine aminotransferase 332 unit/L), elevated creatinine 1.5 mg/dL and anion gap were noted on laboratory studies. Other labs were unremarkable including normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin and thyroid-stimulating hormone.\nSerial 12-lead ECGs showed deep T inversions in V3-V6 and early repolarization in V1 and V2 leads (Figures , ). On arrival, the patient was also in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Figure ), which resolved with intravenous Amiodarone. Septal infarct of undetermined age, possible inferior subendocardial injury, possible anterolateral subendocardial injury, and prolonged QT were also reported on automated interpretation of ECG. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed patent coronary arteries, however, the classic ace of spades sign was seen on ventriculogram (Figure ). Initial transthoracic echocardiogram without contrast was interpreted as normal left ventricular wall thickness, with an ejection fraction of 70% and no wall motion abnormalities.\nThe patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg twice a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) for secondary prevention of another cardiac arrest. The patient was asymptomatic up to discharge three days after admission. Liver function enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) trended down to 65 unit/L and 199 unit/L, respectively. Creatinine also normalized to 1.1 mg/dL.

    "question": "A 12-year-old White male, who had also been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, sought treatment for a 20-day history of non-productive cough and lower limb oedema, which had evolved to anasarca, together with a new onset of hypertension. He had previously experienced one episode of pain and had undergone one transfusion. He reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, he was found to be pallid (+ 3/+ 4) and hypertensive (blood pressure, 160/90 mmHg), with a heart rate of 112 bpm, a respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.\nBlood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 5.9 g/dl; haematocrit, 17.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; negative result on the Coombs direct antibody test; reticulocyte fraction, 4.26%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 970 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.65 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 17,330 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,100 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 1700 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and urea, 45 mg/dl. He also showed signs of hyperfiltration, with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.65 mg/dl, and an eGFR, as determined with the Schwartz formula, of 140.0 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. An urine sample obtained at submission was found to contain 20 leucocytes/field and > 100 erythrocytes/field; 24-h proteinuria was 12.5 g. Metabolic analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 6.1 g/dl; albumin, 2.6 g/dl; globulins, 3.1 g/dl; total cholesterol, 211 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 118 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 66 mg/dl; triglycerides, 133 mg/dl; C4, 25 mg/dl (normal range, 10\u201338 mg/dl); C3, 106 mg/dl (normal range, 73\u2013149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 2.1 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Tests for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were also negative. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia. Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and signs of mild pulmonary congestion. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.\nThe patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy showed 43 glomeruli with diffuse endocapillary hypercellularity (numerous lymphocytes and neutrophils). Synechiae were observed in 10% of the glomeruli in Bowman\u2019s capsule. There was also occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane, as well as overall expansion of the mesangial matrix (Fig. b). There were no changes in the tubules, interstitium or arterioles. Immunofluorescence showed deposition of C3 (2+/3+) and lambda light chains (1+/3+), with a granular pattern, distributed throughout the capillary loop\u2014the so-called \u201cstarry sky\u201d pattern\u2014consistent with a diagnosis of APIGN.\nTreatment with a diuretic and an anti-proteinuric agent (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was instituted, and the patient evolved to clinical improvement, including normalisation of blood pressure and a significant reduction in the level of proteinuria (24-h proteinuria, 1.34 g) after 10 days. Renal function was preserved. The patient left outpatient treatment after 18 months. In the final evaluation, he still presented no proteinuria or haematuria, although the signs of hyperfiltration persisted, his serum creatinine concentration being 0.5 mg/dl and his Schwartz-derived eGFR being 182 ml/min/1.73 m2.

He was treated with dietary restriction, daily NPH insulin injection, and lipid lowing medication such as fibrate derivatives. His father was noted to have hypertension, old cerebral infarction and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His mother had hyperlipidemia (type IV) and his elder brother had recurrent acute pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus. He didn't have xanthoma or xanthelasma. He had no alcohol drinking history and no biliary calculus disease. His height was 176 cm and weight was 87 kg, showing marked obesity. On physical examination, his abdomen was slightly distended with hypoactive bowel sounds and he had direct tenderness on epigastrium without rebound tenderness. On admission, laboratory data showed white blood cell count of 15,210/mm3. Blood chemistry tests revealed fasting blood sugar level of 228 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase level of 379 IU/L, and aspartate aminotransferase level of 20 IU/L. The serum amylase level of 160 mg/dL was slightly higher than the normal range (25~125 mg/dL). Serum lipase level was increased to 1596 U/L (normal range of 13~60 U/L). Serum calcium level and blood urea nitrogen level were within normal limits. The lipid profiles such as total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density cholesterol and low density cholesterol were 272 mg/dL, 605 mg/dL, 28 mg/dL and 98 mg/dL, respectively. A diagnosis of type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia was made based on serum lipoprotein electrophoresis [0% of chylomicron (0-2.0), 62.9% of \u03b2-lipoprotein (36.5-59.1), 22.5% of pre-\u03b2-lipoprotein (3.8-33.8), and 14.6% of \u03b1-lipoprotein (20.4-46.4)].

On physical examination, her height was 160 cm and body weight was 70 kg. Her blood pressure was 230/145 mm Hg, and her heart rate was 100 beats per minute. Auscultation of the chest revealed a coarse breathing sound with crackling and regular heart beats with no murmur. The liver and spleen were not palpable, and her bowel sounds were normal.\nA blood examination revealed a 7,200/mm3 leukocyte count, 16.5 g/dL hemoglobin, a 274,000/mm3 platelet count, 296 mg/dL random glucose, 8.3% hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 28 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 1.5 mg/dL creatinine, 7.0 g/dL protein, 3.6 g/dL albumin, 33 IU/L aspartate aminotransferase, 24 IU/L alanine aminotransferase, 292 IU/L alkaline phosphatase, 2.58 mg/L high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 248 mg/dL total cholesterol, 111 mg/dL triglycerides, 41 mg/dL high density lipoprotein, 181 mg/dL low density lipoprotein, 136 mmol/L sodium, and 4.2 mmol/L potassium. The results of a routine urinalysis were as follows: proteinuria, 2+; glycosuria, 2+; red blood cell, 0 to 1/high power field (HPF) and white blood cell, 5 to 9/HPF; and spot urine protein to creatinine ratio, 428 mg/g. A thyroid function test (TFT) revealed 88 ng/dL T3 (normal range, 78 to 182), 1.44 ng/dL free T4 (normal range, 0.8 to 1.78), and 9.86 mIU/L thyroid stimulating hormone (normal range, 0.17 to 4.05). The TFT results showed subclinical hypothyroidism, but thyroid autoantibodies were negative.\nCardiomegaly was detected on a chest radiograph, and the cardiothoracic ratio was 66% (). The electrocardiogram showed inverted T waves in the lateral and inferior leads, with no significant ST changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed LV hypertrophy and severe systolic dysfunction (). The interventricular septal diameter was 1.3 cm, the LV posterior wall diameter was 1.8 cm, the LV internal diameter in diastole was 5.8 cm (normal range, 3.9 to 5.3), the LV internal diameter in systole was 5.1 cm (normal range, 2.1 to 4.0), and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 25% (). Coronary angiography was performed, and the results were normal.\nThe patient was treated with multiple antihypertensive drugs, including calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and \u03b2-blockers to control a hypertensive crisis, but her blood pressure remained >160/100 mm Hg. Abdominal computed tomography was performed to evaluate secondary hypertension, which revealed no abnormalities in either the renal arteries or adrenal glands.\nTo manage diabetes mellitus, she was referred to Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong. Because the patient had uncontrolled hypertension, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and bone overgrowth, a diagnosis of acromegaly was suspected. Rough and thick skin was observed, and skin tags were noted around the neck. An enlarged jaw and protruded frontal bones were observed, and soft tissue overgrowth of the heel was noted on a lateral view of a foot X-ray (). The basal IGF-1 level was measured as 183.8 ng/mL, which was within the normal range (90 to 360). Acromegaly was diagnosed after performing a 75-g glucose-loading GH suppression test (). In a thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test, GH levels were found to be increased (). MRI of the sella revealed a 5-mm microadenoma on the left side of the pituitary gland (). A combined pituitary stimulation test performed before surgery revealed that both basal and stimulated hormone levels were normal.\nHyperglycemia was treated with 500 mg metformin twice a day and 12 U insulin glargine once a day via subcutaneous injection. We performed a diabetic complication test, and fundoscopy showed severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ().\nThree weeks after admission, combination antihypertensive therapy caused a reduction in blood pressure to <140/80 mm Hg. A follow-up echocardiogram showed no significant difference in LV hypertrophy, but LVEF was improved to 66% ().\nAfter transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor, the tumor was identified as a GH-secreting adenoma () that showed strong staining with anti-GH antibodies in immunohistochemical analysis ().\nWe performed a follow-up 75-g glucose-loading GH suppression test 2 weeks after surgery, and GH levels were suppressed to 0.15 ng/mL, which means cure state (). The levels of GH and IGF-1 were 0.57, 243.7 ng/mL on postoperative day (POD) 3, 0.38, 295.4 ng/mL on POD 50, and 0.4, 249.5 ng/mL 6 months after surgery (). A follow-up transthoracic echocardiography 6 months after surgery revealed improved LV hypertrophy and LVEF compared with preoperative values.\nThe patient was prescribed calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-receptor blockers. Her blood pressure was maintained at 120/70 mm Hg 1 year after surgery. Her blood glucose levels were well controlled, with an HbA1c of 5.4%, using only 500 mg/day metformin without insulin. The degree of diabetic retinopathy was improved somewhat, and the patient was followed-up at the outpatient clinic. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 19-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with persistent substernal chest pain\nfor 3 hours after staying up late for 1 week. He had been in good health without\nhypertension, hyperlipemia, or other related diseases.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation and towering T\nwaves in the V1 to V6 leads () and the cardiac troponin level was 0.248 ng/L (upper limit of normal:\n0.1 ng/L). His left ventricular ejection fraction was 55% and glycated hemoglobin level was\n5.0%. The patient\u2019s lipid levels were as follows: total cholesterol, 3.67 mmol/L; total\ntriglycerides, 1.53 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.91 mmol/L; and\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2.42 mmol/L. He was diagnosed with acute anterior\nmyocardial infarction. His vital signs on presentation were stable with a pulse of\n88 beats/minute, blood pressure of 145/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute,\narterial blood oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and temperature of 36.2\u00b0C. The current\nevidence did not support the diagnosis of aortic dissection, acute pericarditis, acute\npulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or digestive tract diseases. Therefore, we carried out\nfollow-up treatment after obtaining the patient\u2019s consent. After he received aspirin 300 mg,\nticagrelor 180 mg, and a bolus of 3000 units of intravenous heparin, he underwent emergency\ncoronary angiography (CAG). CAG showed thrombosis in the proximal left anterior descending\nartery (pLAD), and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) thrombus grade 4 and TIMI\ngrade 1 distal flow (),\nbut a normal circumflex artery and right coronary artery. A bolus of heparin (3500 IU) and a\nglycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist (tirofiban) was administered, and a 6F BL3.5 guide catheter\n(Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted, followed by repeated manual thrombus aspiration.\nSubsequent CAG showed TIMI grade 3 flow (). After taking into consideration the patient\u2019s age, intracoronary OCT\nwas performed to assess whether more interventions were essential. OCT showed a residual red\nand white thrombus and plaque erosion in the pLAD. The minimal lumen diameter of the pLAD\nwas 1.92 mm, the area was 2.95 mm2, and the area of stenosis was 48% (). Accordingly, stent\nimplantation was avoided for the patient. He was discharged with optimal medical therapy,\nwhich comprised aspirin, ticagrelor, metoprolol, and a statin, for 12 months as recommended\nby guidelines for prevention of secondary coronary events. CAG and OCT 1 month after primary\npercutaneous coronary intervention showed that an organized thrombus remained in the pLAD\nand that a lipid plaque was under the endomembrane with an unbroken fibrous cap and no\nplaque rupture ().\nCholesterol crystals and microphage infiltration were detected. The patient has remained\nasymptomatic and no adverse events were observed during 6 months of follow-up. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 32-year old Korean female was admitted with a complaint of edema and pain on the left leg for 2 months. In January 1993, she was diagnosed as SLE at another hospital and manifested gross hematuria, proteinuria, azotemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypocomplementemia, positive FANA, positive anti-ds DNA antibody and positive anti-ENA antibody. In May 1993, she was transferred to Kangnam St. Mary\u2019s Hospital with steroid (prednisolone 1mg/kg) medication. We checked the titer of anticardiolipin antibody (ACA), which was 100 GPL IU/ml and followed up the titer of ACA regularly at 2 months\u2019 intervals and the titer of ACA IgG was persistently elevated. Her parity was 0-0-0-0 and she showed thrombocytopenia (35,000/mm3) and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (59.2 sec, control 27.0 sec). Her clinical features were Antiphospholipid syndrome in SLE and she was treated with baby aspirin 100 mg/day and steroid (prednisolone 1mg/kg) at the outpatient clinic. From April 1994, she suffered from edema and pain on the left leg and was admitted to our hospital in June 1994. On admission, she had polyarthralgia but did not complain of fever, malar rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcer, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, xerostomia, xerophalmia and allopecia. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. pulse rate 76 beats per minute, respiration rate 20 per minute and body temperature 36.5\u00b0C. There were no pathologic lesions in her eyes, ears, nasal or oral mucosa. Chest auscultation and abdomen palpation revealed no abnormalities and peripheral arterial pulsation was normal. There were no cutaneous vasculitis and abnormal neurologic signs.\nOn laboratory findings, hemoglobin was 10.6 g/dl, hematocrit 32%, white blood cell 8.1\u00d7103/mm3 (neutrophil 82%. lymphocyte 10%) and platelet 122\u00d7103/mm3. Renal function showed blood urea nitorgen 5.3 mg/dl, creatinine 0.9 mg/dl and 24hr urine protein 6.18 g/day. Urinanalysis showed 0 to 2 white cells and 10 to 20 red cells per high power fields. Lipid profile revealed total cholesterol 170 mg/dl. triglyceride 98 mg/dl and HDL-cholesterol 51 mg/dl. The AST was 16 IU/L. ALT 12 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 229 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dl, total protein 4.1 g/dl and albumin 2.1 g/dl. The prothrombin time was 11.8 sec (control 12.1 sec) and activated partial thromboplastin time 59.2 sec (control 26.6 sec). On immunologic studies, FANA was positive (homogenous pattern, titer 1 : 1280), anti-ds DNA antibody 5 IU/ml, C3 21 mg/dl and C4 15 mg/dl. Rheumatoid factor was negative and ANCA was positive (GS-ANA, titer 1 : 80). Anti-cardiolipin antibody Ig G was 100 GPL IU/ml. Lupus anticoagulant was positive by the Kaolin clotting test. Anti-ENA and anti-Ro antibodies were all negative. The direct and indirect Coombs\u2019 tests were all negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 18 mm/hr and C-reactive protein 2.4 mg/l. The immunoglobulin G, A, M levels revelaed 928, 274, 106 mg/dl, respectively. The serum viral hepatitis markers revealed that HBs antigen was negative, HBs antibody positive and HCV antibody negative. Gastrofiberscope showed esophageal varix, grade 2, and gastric fundal varix. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a moderate amount of ascites, moderate splenomegaly and marked coarse increased liver echogenecity. At computed tomography of the abdomen, we could not trace the inferior vena cava at the intrahepatic portion(). Doppler ultrasonography of the left leg showed no thrombosis in the superficial femoral vein and popliteal vein. Inferior and superior venocavograms showed obstructions at the intrahepatic portion of IVC and at both subclavian veins and abnormal collateral vessels were found around the obstructions (, ). We injected Heparin 5,000 units and Urokinase 500,000 units intravenously at the bolus during venocavogram and further thrombolytic therapy (Heparin 5,000 units/day and Urokinase 500,000 units/day continuously all day long) was done for additional two days. We followed the venocavogram to evaluate the extent of thrombosis, compared with pre-thrombolytic therapy, but we could not find any interval change. We decided to give the patient Warfarin 5 mg/day, Prednisolone 1 mg/kg and baby aspirin 100 mg/day and to follow her up at the outpatient clinic. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 22-year-old male patient with a past medical history of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous nephropathy, which was diagnosed by renal biopsy 1 year ago, was admitted to the emergency room and transferred to our cardiac care unit with the complaint of chest pain along with dizziness, headache, and radiating pain to his left arm for 4 hours. The patient took no drugs in the past 6 months. On clinical examination, his pain was reported to be 5/10 according to the visual analogue pain scale, he was afebrile, with a maximum temperature of 36.6\u00b0C, and had ortho-arteriotony, with a blood pressure of 128/85 mmHg, and no tachycardia or bradycardia (pulse rate of 66 beats per minute). The patient\u2019s face was bloated, but there was no jugular venous distention, muffled breath sounds, rhonchi or moist rale, the third or fourth heart sound gallop, pericardial rub, peritoneal irritation, hepatosplenomegaly, or leg oedema. Electrocardiogram on admission showed that ST elevated to 0.1\u20130.2 mv in II, III, aVF, and V4\u2013V6 ().\nInitial abnormal serum laboratory results were as follows: troponin I, 3.499 ug/L; myoglobin, 1200 ug/L; creatine kinase-MB, 69 U/L; creatine kinase, 678 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 343 U/L; cholesterol, 6.43 mmol/L; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 5.02 mmol/L; glucose, 2.44 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.76 mmol/L; prothrombin time, 10.3 s; activated partial thromboplastin time, 24.5 seconds; serum total protein, 39.1 g/L; albumin, 20.2 g/L; and 24-hour urine protein, 11.054 g/24 hours.\nAccording to the results, our preliminary diagnosis was acute inferior myocardial infarction (Killip grade I) combined with nephrotic syndrome, and we performed a percutaneous intervention procedure, which was followed by 300 mg aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel orally immediately. During the operation, we saw that the left coronary artery had thickened and the left main artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery were normal. However, there was a great deal of thrombi blocking the anterior and middle anterior descending branch, resulting in 95% stricture () and leading to bloodstream classification at thrombolysis and thrombin inhibition in myocardial infarction grade II. Next, we applied the thrombus suction technique and injected 13 ml of tirofiban to dissolve blood clots. Unfortunately, there was still medium thrombi remaining and 60% stricture in the re-examination of coronary arteriography (). The bloodstream classification at thrombolysis and thrombin inhibition in myocardial infarction grade III. Because the anterior descending branch dilatation made it unsuitable for stent implantation, we had to stop further operation. Next, we gave him a therapeutic regimen of low-molecular-weight heparin for 7 days, 100 mg aspirin per day, and 90 mg ticagrelor twice a day to fight platelet aggregation, and 40 mg atorvastatin per night to remedy hyperlipidaemia persistently.\nOne day after the operation, his postoperative electrocardiogram showed that the elevated ST segments in II, III, aVF, and V4\u2013V6 were down to baseline, and an inverted T wave began to appear in V2\u2013V6 (). An echocardiography performed 3 days after admission showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 48.2%, enlarged bilateral atrium, dilated left ventricle, segmental weak pulse of left ventricular wall, mild regurgitation of bicuspid valve or of tricuspid valve, and the estranged left ventricular cells (). Laboratory tests on the same day showed a higher troponin I of 31.833 ug/L, lower myoglobin of 27.9 ug/L, creatine kinase-MB of 21 U/L, creatine kinase of 74 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase of 489 U/L. After 4 days, the serum laboratory results showed the following results: troponin I, 6.912 ug/L; myoglobin, 29.5 ug/L; creatine kinase-MB, 17 U/L; creatine kinase, 36 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 330 U/L; cholesterol, 2.86 mmol/L; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 1.63 mmol/L; triglyceride, 2.28 mmol/L; and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.57 mmol/L. All the related indexes were decreased. On the 14th day after the operation, the patient had a third examination of coronary arteriography, which revealed that there was barely any blockage caused by thrombi in the anterior descending branch and no stricture in the coronary artery (). The patient was discharged on the 17th day, as his vitals were stable and symptoms disappeared. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration? Please outuput your answer in terms of mg/dL.",

    "question": "A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed with hypertension by a private clinic in August 2013, based upon a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg and she was prescribed antihypertensive drugs to treat the condition. Initial therapy consisted of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and losartan 50 mg daily. After 1 week, her blood pressure was still high, so the doctor changed her medication to amlodipine 5 mg, losartan 100 mg, and indapamide 2.5 mg per day. Five days after initiating this second regimen of drugs, she developed pretibial pitting edema, and thorough workup was done for the symptom. There were bilateral adrenal masses on abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT). Routine blood tests revealed the following: potassium 2.2 mmol/L, plasma renin activity (PRA) 0.12 ng/mL/hr, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) 16.76 ng/dL, and an aldosterone/renin ratio (PAC/PRA) >30, indicative of primary hyperaldosteronism.\nFollowing her possible diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism, the patient was referred to our hospital for additional testing. At the time of admission, her blood pressure was 155/111 mm Hg, height was 164.5 cm, and weight was 63.5 kg (body mass index, 23.47 kg/m2). Pretibial pitting edemas were detected, but no physical signs of Cushing syndrome were observed.\nA routine blood test at the time of admission showed the following: white blood cell 6,900/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet 351,000/\u00b5L, total protein 6.9 g/dL, albumin 4.1 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 76 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 126 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 7.3 mg/dL, creatinine 0.71 mg/dL, sodium 141 mmol/L, potassium 2.9 mmol/L, chloride 101 mmol/L, total cholesterol 210 mg/dL, triglyceride 104 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 50 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein 141 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c 5.9%. Biochemical evaluation of pheochromocytoma showed no excessive catecholamine production. The transtubular potassium concentration gradient was 12.64%, suggesting the possibility of hyperaldosteronism or hypercortisolism. PAC and PRA were 24.4 ng/dL and 0.76 ng/mL/hr, respectively, and the PAC/PRA ratio was 32.11 (). After correcting for hypokalemia, a saline loading test was performed, which revealed no suppression of the aldosterone level after saline administration, consistent with a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism (the basal PAC 24.4 ng/dL increased to 27.3 ng/dL after a 2 L saline infusion). Dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) resulted in no suppression of cortisol levels (). Adrenal CT demonstrated two bilateral adrenal masses in each of the adrenal glands, including a 1.6-cm mass on the right and a 2-cm mass on the left adrenal gland (). An adrenal cortical scan using iodine-131-6\u03b2-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) showed focally increased radioactive uptakes in the bilateral adrenal gland areas, with a substantially higher uptake on the left side ().\nBilateral adrenal venous sampling (AVS) with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation () revealed inadequate right adrenal venous blood sampling (right adrenal vein cortisol level/peripheral blood cortisol level [CRt/CP] <10), whereas the cortisol concentration in the left adrenal venous blood showed successful sampling on the left side. One explanation for this difference may be that the low level of CRt was the result of suppressed cortisol secretion due to excessive cortisol secretion from the left adrenal mass. The left adrenal vein aldosterone/cortisol (ALt/CLt) ratio was lower than that of peripheral blood, implying the possibility of suppressed aldosterone secretion from this side caused by a contralateral adrenal mass which might secrete excessive aldosterone []. Four days after the first AVS, a second AVS was performed using low-dose DST but without ACTH infusion (). This time, we also measured the epinephrine levels in the both adrenal veins and peripheral blood; a large peripheral-to-adrenal gradient of epinephrine assured successful catheterization on both sides []. CLt/CP testing confirmed that the left adrenal mass was a cortisol-secreting adenoma [].\nEven though those two AVS results appeared to provide clear evidence of the lateralization of functioning adrenal masses, such an independent functioning of bilateral masses was highly suspicious. We therefore concluded that sequential adrenalectomies, rather than concurrent operations, would be beneficial for making a definitive diagnosis. Moreover, the patient agreed to do sequential operations. The first procedure was a laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy of the right adrenal gland to remove the putative aldosterone-producing mass, with the goal of controlling hypertension and hypokalemia. A firm, 1.5-cm ovoid, well-circumscribed, bright yellow tumor mass lacking necrosis or hemorrhage was arising from the cortex of the adrenal gland in the pathologic specimen. Within 24 hours after surgery, the patient's blood pressure had fallen to 110/80 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication, serum potassium normalized at 4.5 mmol/L, and PAC decreased to 3 ng/dL. These large postoperative changes strongly suggested that the right adrenal adenoma was producing excessive aldosterone. By day 3, an overnight DST continued to show no cortisol suppression, indicating persistent secretion of corticosteroid from the left adrenal mass. To limit the likelihood of subclinical Cushing syndrome progressing to overt Cushing syndrome, we opted to completely remove the left adrenal gland as a means of controlling hypercortisolism. The excised portion of the adrenal mass contained an encapsulated brown solid mass.\nThe patient began taking prednisolone 10 mg once a day for steroid replacement 1 day after the second surgery. By 2 months she had lost 5 kg of body weight. At that time, a rapid ACTH test revealed adrenal insufficiency (). At 16 months after surgery, the patient has gradually reduced her prednisolone intake to 5 mg every other day. Her blood pressure and serum potassium levels have remained within normal ranges, without the need for additional antihypertensive medications or potassium supplements.

    "question": "A 19-year-old-male presented in May 2007 with swelling of the lower limbs and periorbital puffiness of 2 months\u2019 duration. Evaluation at his primary health centre had revealed albuminuria on dipstick analysis, prompting referral to our institution. He gave no history of recent infections, arthralgia, oral ulcers, cough or haemoptysis. On examination, he had bilateral leg oedema extending up to his knees. The blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 90 b.p.m. and respiratory rate 14/min. The cardiovascular, abdomen, chest and nervous system examinations were within normal limits. Urinalysis showed 4+ proteinuria, but no erythrocytes or leucocytes. The 24-h urine protein excretion was 6.3 g. The serum creatinine was 71 \u03bcmol/L (0.8 mg/dL); serum total protein and albumin were 55 and 17 g/L (5.5 and 1.7 g/dL), respectively, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases were 12 and 14 IU/L, respectively. Serum cholesterol was 10.4 mmol/L (400 mg/dL), triglyceride 2.8 mmol/L (250 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein 7.2 mmol/L (280 mg/dL) and high-density lipoprotein 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL). He tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HCV antibody and human immunodeficiency virus I/II. The antinuclear antibody test was negative.\nKidney biopsy (A) revealed 10 glomeruli, which were normal on light microscopy (LM), as were the tubulointerstitial and vascular compartments. Immunofluorescence did not reveal any immune deposits and electron microscopy (EM) showed diffuse foot process effacement.\nA diagnosis of minimal-change disease (MCD) was made and the patient was started on oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day. However, the proteinuria did not show any reduction. At the end of 4 months, the daily urinary protein excretion remained at 5 g. He was deemed to be steroid resistant and treated first with oral cyclophosphamide at 2 mg/kg for 3 months, followed by oral cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/day, average C0 120 ng/mL) and oral prednisolone (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 6 months, mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day for 6 months and finally a combination of tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg/day, average Tac C0 7 ng/mL) and oral prednisolone (0.1 mg/kg/day). The nephrotic state persisted throughout this period, with serum albumin <20 g/L (2.0 g/dL) and the serum creatinine 62\u201380 \u03bcmol/L (0.7\u20130.9 mg/dL) (). During the entire course of his illness, he was continued on supportive therapy with torsemide 10\u201320 mg twice daily, atorvastatin 20 mg/day and losartan 150 mg/day.\nAt this time, the kidney biopsy was repeated. LM revealed 13 glomeruli, 2 of which showed segmental collapse of the capillary tuft with an overlying crown of podocytes along with synechiae formation, 2 showed segmental endocapillary cellularity with foam cells, 2 were globally sclerosed and the remaining 7 did not show any significant abnormality (B). Tubules showed abundant protein absorption droplets along with patchy tubular atrophy occupying 20% of the biopsy area. Tubules close to the medulla showed marked nucleomegaly along with nuclear smudging associated with tubular necrosis, interstitial oedema and mild-to-moderate patchy plasma cell-rich interstitial inflammation occupying 10% of the biopsy area. Blood vessels were within normal limits. Immunofluorescence was negative for all immunoglobulins, C1q and light chains. EM showed segmental sclerosis with evidence of collapse (C). There was diffuse and extensive foot process effacement, and no reticular aggregates were seen. Ki 67 immunostain showed nuclear positivity in the podocytes of glomeruli showing collapse (D). CD 20 staining was negative. A final diagnosis of CG was made. The patient's serum tested negative by polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus and parvovirus B-19.\nIn view of his resistance to the above therapies and a persistently severe nephrotic state with the biopsy showing many plasma cells, the patient was treated with 4 weekly injections of rituximab (375 mg/m2/dose). His oedema subsided and he stopped requiring the diuretic 3 months after the last dose. Six months after the last dose of rituximab, the 24-h urine protein was 1.8 g with a serum albumin of 37 g/L (3.7 g/dL). The patient has now been followed up for 18 months and remains asymptomatic. On his last follow-up, his 24-h urine protein is 1.2 g, serum creatinine 80 \u03bcmol/L (0.9 mg/dL) and serum albumin 47 g/L (4.7 g/dL). shows the evolution of his clinical and laboratory parameters during the course of the treatment.

    "question": "A 45-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to substernal chest discomfort on mild exertion, which occurred three weeks prior to presentation. The frequency and severity of his angina increased over time and the patient described a squeezing chest pain with an onset three days prior to presentation. The past medical history included hypertension, diagnosed three years ago, and smoking history of ten pack-years. There was no family history of coronary artery or hematologic disease. At the time of admission he was on aspirin and anti-hypertensive medications. On physical examination, the blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and the heart rate was 70 beats per minute. The heart sounds were unremarkable with normal S1 and S2 sounds. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The electrocardiogram showed no ST-segment change, T wave inversion or pathologic Q waves suggestive of myocardial ischemia. No abnormality was found on chest roentgenogram. On complete blood count, the hemoglobin was 13.9 g/dL, white blood cell count was 9,400/L, and the platelet count was 106\u00d7104/\u00b5L. Electrolytes, renal and liver function tests were not remarkable. Levels of CK-MB and Troponin-T were within normal range. Total serum cholesterol was 161 mg/dL, triglyceride was 95 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein was 39 mg/dL. Serum homocystein level was 12.7 nmol/mL (reference range 5-15 nmol/mL), and hsCRP was 1.91 mg/L (reference range <3 mg/L). Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen level were within normal range. The iron profile was not remarkable. Bone marrow study showed a hypercellular marrow with markedly increased megakaryocytes, and a normal myeloid/erythroid ratio (). Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells revealed a normal 46, XY karyotype with no evidence of bcr/abl rearrangement. Liver and spleen were not enlarged on sonogram images. An elective coronary angiography, two days after admission, showed total occlusion at the mid right coronary artery (RCA) with well-developed collaterals from proximal RCA to PD and PL branches. In addition, there was diffuse irregular, up to 70%, luminal narrowing with haziness noted at the proximal RCA. The left coronary angiography showed a 40% luminal narrowing at the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD). The echocardiography, performed three days after admission, showed no regional wall motion abnormality with about 60% of left ventricular ejection fraction. On color Doppler imaging, there was no significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation noted. There was a relaxational abnormality observed in the diastolic filling pattern. The patient was taking aspirin 100 mg/day, clopidogrel 75 mg/day, atenolol 25 mg/day, diltiazem 90 mg/day and nicorandil 15 mg/day from the day of admission. The chest pain was controlled by medical treatment; therefore, we decided to postpone coronary artery intervention until the platelet count reached a normal level. Treatment with hyroxyurea 500 mg/day and anagrelide HCl 1 mg/day was started as cytostatic therapy. The platelet count was normalized (23\u00d7104/\u00b5L) five weeks after initiation of cytostatic therapy, and coronary artery intervention was then performed. The totally occluded mid RCA lesion was thought to be a chronic total occlusion because of the presence of good collateral flow from the proximal RCA. We thought that the proximal RCA, stenotic lesion with haziness, resulted from a plaque rupture resulting in an occlusive thrombus, and caused the ischemic symptoms that the patient presented with. Two coronary stents were placed at the proximal and mid RCA. No residual stenosis was observed after the procedure (). The LAD lesion was not treated. The patient was discharged two days after the procedure without any hemorrhagic or thrombotic complication; he remained on aspirin, clopidogrel, hydroxyurea, and anagrelide. The patient was free of symptoms for six months during the follow-up period, and his platelet count remained within normal range. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "In January 2014, a 45-year-old Japanese man was referred to our clinic owing to obesity, daytime sleepiness, and snoring during sleep. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 10 points. He underwent overnight diagnostic polysomnography in February 2014. Upon admission, his height was 178.6 cm, weight was 130.7 kg, abdominal circumference was 122 cm, and BMI was 41.0 kg/m2. Physical examination showed that the thyroid gland was not palpable. His serum levels of creatine kinase and creatinine were elevated at 1581 U/L and 1.46 mg/dL, respectively, while his other laboratory results were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase, 57 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 49 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 353 U/L; total cholesterol (TC), 335 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 45 mg/dL; triglycerides (TGs), 211 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 248 mg/dL; fasting blood sugar, 86 mg/dL; glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 6.1 %; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), >500 \u03bcIU/mL; free triiodothyronine, 1.4 pg/mL; free thyroxine, <0.15 ng/dL; thyroid peroxidase antibody, 10 IU/mL; and thyroglobulin antibody, >4000 IU/mL (Table ). Blood samples were evaluated using routine methods at Sapporo Clinical Laboratory Inc. (Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan). Based on these results, indicating hypothyroidism and thyroglobulin antibody positivity, the patient was diagnosed with severe primary hypothyroidism (Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis). His dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance were considered as secondary changes due to primary hypothyroidism and obesity. Because polysomnography showed an apnea\u2013hypopnea index (AHI) of 71.2 events/h (normal, <5 events/h) and a minimal SpO2 of 60 %, he also was diagnosed with severe OSA associated with autoimmune hypothyroidism. Therefore, in the beginning of March 2014, nasal CPAP (ICON+Auto, auto-adjusting CPAP; Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Limited, Auckland, New Zealand; minimal pressure, 4.0 cmH2O; maximal pressure, 18.0 cmH2O) and low-dose levothyroxine (12.5 \u03bcg/day) were initiated. Upon initiation of the CPAP therapy, the patient was informed that he would have to continue with the CPAP therapy unless his body weight decreased sufficiently.\nIn April 2014, the patient\u2019s body weight had decreased to 125.2 kg, and post-CPAP polysomnography indicated improved OSA (AHI, 2.8 events/h; minimal SpO2, 88 %). A monthly follow-up visit was scheduled to check his body weight and adherence to CPAP. The memory stick of the CPAP machine showed that he used CPAP for an average of 6 h per night, 6 days a week, and that he had an AHI of approximately 2.0 events/h. In the course of gradually increasing the dose of levothyroxine, the patient reportedly felt better and had recovered from his fatigue and lethargy.\nTo address his weight loss as a priority, an LCD was initiated in July 2014 []. Yamada et al. [] reported the benefits of a non-calorie-restricted LCD with the amount of carbohydrates limited to 70\u2013130 g/day for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. The patient consumed 50 g of white rice per meal in addition to vegetables, fish, eggs, and meat in the morning and at noon; however, he did not eat rice, noodles, or other carbohydrates at night. In February 2015, the dose of 175 \u03bcg/day levothyroxine appeared to maintain a euthyroid state (TSH, 0.75 \u03bcIU/mL), and his other laboratory results were within normal limits, including an HbA1c level of 5.3 %, TC level of 194 mg/dL, and TG level of 89 mg/dL.\nFinally, in July 2015, the patient\u2019s body weight reached 98.3 kg, a reduction of 32.4 kg (25 % of his initial body weight), while his BMI decreased from 41.0 to 30.8 kg/m2. Figure shows changes in his body weight and TSH level over time. The patient felt motivated by the prospect of discontinuing the CPAP therapy, and was encouraged by the consistent weight loss at the monthly clinical visits. He also wanted to continue with the LCD because he did not find it difficult. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration? Please outuput your answer in terms of mg/dL.",

The patient reported an athletic lifestyle, with recent exertional chest pain while kayaking and cycling. The patient reported that his most recent episode of pain awoke him from his sleep, prompting him to seek evaluation in the emergency department.\nLaboratory testing revealed an elevated troponin I of 0.43 ng/mL (normal: <0.08 ng/mL), troponin T of 0.13 ng/mL (normal: <0.01 ng/mL), and pro B-type natriuretic peptide of 898 pg/mL (normal: <125 pg/mL). ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with deep symmetrical T wave inversions across anterior precordial leads suggestive of Wellens syndrome with Type B findings (Figure ).\nSignificant risk factors were evaluated and not found to be present. The patient was found to have a lipid profile of cholesterol 145 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 32 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein 95 mg/dL, non-HDL 113 mg/dL, triglycerides 88 mg/dL, very low-density lipoprotein 18 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c of 5.6%. The patient denied any history of hypertension and presented with a blood pressure of 122/79 mmHg on admission.

The patient was considered a moderate risk based on the HEART Score for six-week risk of major adverse cardiac events.\nThe patient underwent emergent cardiac catheterization, which revealed one-vessel CAD with a complete ostial occlusion of the LAD (Figure ). The right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery did not have any angiographically significant disease. Well-established collaterals were present from the dominant RCA, which supplied the mid-segment of the LAD (Figures , ). Due to the proximal location and nature of the occlusion, no intervention was attempted, and the patient was immediately referred to cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).\nThe patient underwent successful CABG with the left internal mammary artery to the LAD.

Two years prior, she was diagnosed with MDS of the refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 subtype, according to World Health Organization classification. The International Prognostic Scoring System score was 3 and classified as high risk group. Following induction chemotherapy with azacitidine until the 16th cycle, the patient achieved complete remission. Chromosome analysis showed hyperdiploid clone with complex karyotypic abnormalities including trisomy 8 (55,XX, +1, +4, del(5)(q13), +6, +8, +9, +10, +14, +21, +22[17]/46, XX[3]).\nThe patient had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) 2 years previously. Serum glucose level was controlled without complications such as diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy including microalbuminuria.\nLaboratory test revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin concentration, 6.0 g/dL; white blood cell count, 2.25\u00d7109/L; platelet count, 12\u00d7109/L); slightly abnormal serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, 213 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein, 26 mg/dL; triglyceride, 284 mg/dL); normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time; and elevated levels of fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product and D-dimer. Thrombolytic therapy and antiplatelet drugs were contraindicated due to thrombocytopenia. Electrocardiography and echocardiography showed no abnormal result.\nOn physical examination, the patient was alert and hemodynamically stable. Her initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 6 (facial palsy 1, right arm motor 4, dysarthria 1). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed scattered acute infarction in the left cerebral deep white matter near primary motor cortex-white matter junction, corona radiata, and angular gyrus. Brain magnetic resonance angiography indicated severe stenosis and/or acute thrombosis of left proximal M1. And, perfusion MRI showed abnormal perfusion with delayed mean transit time (, , ).\nOn the third day of admission, she underwent rehabilitation consult. Manual muscle strength test (MMT) of right arm was grade 1 proximally and grade 0 at wrist; and the strength of right leg was grade 3 at whole lower limb. The patient scored 40 on the Korean version of Modified Barthel Index, suggesting total dependency of activities of daily living (ADL), and exhibited anomic aphasia. On the 27th day of admission, the patient was unable to open her right eye. The result of follow-up MMT was grade 0 at right whole upper limb, grade 1 at right hip and knee, and grade 2 at right ankle. Further radiologic study was not done despite possibility of progression. During the hospitalization period, conservative treatments alone were administered including intravenous hydration, transfusion, antibiotics for the recurrent infection, and bedside rehabilitative therapy. Additional chemotherapy was not possible because of poor general condition. On the 44th day of admission, the patient was transferred to a secondary referral hospital. On the day of discharge, her NIHSS score was 10 (facial palsy 2, right arm motor 3, right leg motor 2, limb ataxia 1, sensory 1, dysarthria 1), which was increased from that on admission.

    "question": "In December 2020, a 51-year-old non-obese Japanese man presented to the Diabetes Care Center at Jinnouchi Hospital in Kumamoto, Japan, because of the suspicion of T2DM with hyperglycemia by an annual health screening (fasting glucose; 164 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); 8.8 %). He was initially pointed out his hyperglycemia at fasting condition by a health screening three years ago (fasting glucose; 140 mg/dL, HbA1c; 7.6 %) but he did not go to the hospital because he had no symptoms and did not recognize his own disease severity. He was an office worker and did not have a habit of excessive soft drink intake, and an unbalanced diet caused zinc deficiency. He was a current smoker (10 cigarettes/day) and had a daily drinking habit (30 g of alcohol/day). He did not have an active exercise habit. He did not have a family history of T2DM, cardiovascular disease, or any habitual medications.\nAt his first visit to our outpatient service, clinical examination showed a body height of 168.1 cm, bodyweight of 62.2 kg, body mass index (BMI) of 22.2 kg/m2 (non-obese), blood pressure of 150/79 mmHg (hypertension), and regular pulse rate of 77 beats/min. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory examination showed hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose concentration, 172 mg/dL); elevated concentration of HbA1c (8.5 %) with normoinsulinemia (4.2 \u03bcU/mL; normal rage: 2.2~12.4 \u03bcU/mL), high total cholesterol (248 mg/dL), and high triglyceride (342 mg/dL); and a reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (39 mg/dL) (Table ).\nHe did not have diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, thyroid dysfunction, or adrenal abnormality. He was non-obese but not salcopenic, and he had no evidence of excess fat accumulation assessed by bioelectrical impedance analyzer [] and abdominal computed tomography (Table ).\nWe performed 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (75g-OGTT) and we found the well-maintained basal insulin secretion without hyperinsulinemia, prolonged hyperglycemia, and poor elevating insulin response to glucose load (Table ).\nBased on the results of blood insulin levels in 75g-OGTT, we possibly speculated the presence of pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction as his primary pathogenic cause of diabetes (Table ).\nThree weeks after his first visit, he was admitted to our hospital for assessment and treatment of his hyperglycemia. We found that his antibody titer to glutamic acid decarboxylase was undetectable (<5.0 U/mL) and his daily urinary C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) excretion was unexpectedly accelerated at 182.07 \u00b5g/day, thus establishing a definitive diagnosis of T2DM (Table ).\nAfter admission, we provided the hospitalized dietary (1800 Kcal/day) and exercise therapies according to our standard protocol []. On the second day of hospitalization (before treatment), his blood glucose levels were still elevated under the optimal dietary therapy (Table ).\nOn the third day of hospitalization, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp examination [] revealed no insulin resistance (M-value>8.0), enhanced insulin sensitivity (M/I>12.0), and elevated insulin clearance assessed by the metabolic clearance rate of insulin (MCRI>500) (Table ).\nWe also found the strongly increased hepatic insulin clearance assessed by the molar ratio of CPR/insulin at fasting condition (Table ). Abdominal computed tomography showed normal subcutaneous and abdominal fat deposition and normal hepatic fat accumulation as assessed by the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio (Table ). His pathogenic condition of abnormal glucose-metabolism suggested the possibility of attenuated insulin actions by the elevated insulin clearance but neither pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction nor insulin resistance.\nBecause of the preserved capacity of endogenous insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and the absence of insulin resistance, the patient initially received lifestyle modification therapy with stopping smoking and drinking, taking adequate calorie intake, reducing salt intake, and introducing an exercise habit during the hospitalized treatments []. He also received an explanation for his diabetic conditions and his novel pathogenesis of hyperglycemia with elevated insulin clearance. Because we have no established and evidence-based interventional strategies to treat his elevated insulin clearance, we started to treat him with metformin (initial dose of 500 mg/day and maintenance dose of 1000 mg/day) and followed up his hyperglycemia. His hyperglycemia was not life-threatening at the time of hospital admission (no ketosis and no symptom), and dietary therapy and metformin were effective for his hyperglycemia. During the hospitalized therapy, we measured fasting blood glucose levels every morning and measured the daily blood glucose profile. At the same time, we started statin (rosuvastatin; 5 mg/day), fibrate (fenofibrate; 160 mg/day), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril; 5 mg/day) to treat his hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and we subsequently added ezetimibe 10 mg/day and \u03b1-glycosidase inhibitor (voglibose; 0.9 mg/day). On the fourteenth day of hospitalization, his blood glucose concentration and blood pressure (blood pressure; 119/71 mmHg) were well-controlled (Table ). We finally found a decrease in daily urinary CPR excretion (103.75 \u00b5g/day) and blood insulin level (1.8 \u03bcU/mL) as compared to the pre-treatment condition. His elevated hepatic insulin clearance was not rapidly changed after the two weeks of hospital therapies (molar ratio of CPR/insulin at fasting condition; 41.8). After 17 days of in-hospital therapies and education, the patient was discharged with the recommendation to continue appropriate dietary therapy (1800 kcal/day as described above) and at least 30 minutes of daily exercise. The patient continued treatment with all the medications described above and underwent monthly outpatient follow-ups.\nAfter discharge, we followed him at our outpatient service as usual [], which led to an improvement in his blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations. In March 2021, his blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid parameters have been well managed at our outpatient service (fasting glucose; 117 mg/dL, and HbA1c; 6.6 %, blood pressure; 112/71 mmHg, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 59 mg/dL, and triglyceride; 75 mg/dL). We want to re-perform the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp examination to evaluate insulin clearance and insulin sensitivity at our outpatient service after 12 months of treatment or after glycemic control had been improved. We are not sure whether we will be able to re-evaluate the elevated insulin clearance in the future. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "The 35-year-old male patient presented to our clinic with the complaints of headache, sore throat, a one-month history of a rapidly growing mass in the neck, and weight loss. At presentation, the patient had been followed up due to the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis for the last 10 years. Physical examination revealed a pain in the neck and a 1 cm nodule in the thyroid isthmus on palpation. Moreover, the breath sounds were decreased in the right lung. Laboratory tests were as follows: white blood cell: 3800/mm3, hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL, platelet: 159,000/L, C-reactive protein (CRP): 25 mg/L (normal, 0 to 1 mg/dL), glucose: 90, urea: 47, creatinine: 1.07 mg/dL (0.84\u20131.25), aspartate transaminase (AST): 26 U/L (8\u201340), alanine transaminase (ALT): 43 U/L (5\u201335), sodium: 139 mmol/L (136\u2013146), potassium: 4.7 mmol/L (2.5\u20134.5), triglyceride: 342 mg/dL (35\u2013150), HDL: 35 mg/dL (40\u201360), total cholesterol: 302 mg/dL (120\u2013200), and sedimentation: 76/h. The cardiothoracic ratio was increased on the PA-AC graph. Pericardial effusion was detected during the consultations with the relevant departments. During the investigation of the etiology of the pericardial effusion, nephrotic-range proteinuria (3.6 gr/day) was detected. Subcutaneous biopsy was performed on suspicion of amyloidosis in the etiology of proteinuria but no sign of amyloidosis was found in the immunohistochemical analysis. Duodenal and rectal mucosal biopsies were performed but amyloid was detected only in the rectal mucosa. The presence of amyloid was confirmed by the appearance of Congo Red and apple-green birefringence and immunohistochemical staining patterns. Thyroid function tests were as follows: Ft3: 2.14 pg/mL (normal, 2.5 to 3.9 pg/mL), Ft4: 1.01 ng/dL (0.61\u20131.12), TSH: 0.29 \u03bcIU/mL (0.34\u20134.2), anti-thyroid peroxidase (Anti-TPO): 28 IU/mL (0\u201335), and antithyroglobulin (AntiTG): 110 IU/mL (0\u2013115). On ultrasonography, both thyroid parenchymata were heterogeneous, whereas a 12 \u00d7 8 mm heterogeneous, degenerated, mixed nodule was detected in the isthmus and a 13 \u00d7 8 mm cystic nodule was detected in the inferior segment of the right lobe. Thyroid scintigraphy revealed low thyroid activity and increased background activity in the thyroid area. Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid gland revealed a 12 \u00d7 8 mm mixed nodule with benign cytological results in the isthmus and an 18 mm cystic nodule at the junction of the left lobe with the isthmus. Thyroid scintigraphy was normal. In the follow-up period, total thyroidectomy was performed due to euthyroidism. Pathological analysis revealed amyloid deposition in the entire thyroid gland and deposition of amorphous eosinophilic material between the follicular structures. Amyloid was histochemically stained with PAS and Congo Red stains and was immunohistochemically classified as AA (Figures , , and ). The patient has been followed up for the last 15 months, and he is currently undergoing the treatment of levothyroxine intoxication and is in remission for amyloidosis that developed secondary to ulcerative colitis.

    "question": "A 53-year-old female presented to our hospital complaining of a 6-month history of backache. Judging from the blood testing results, she had hypercalcemia, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was increased to 1,253 U/L (normal range, 35 to 130); the patient was sent to the endocrinology department. Her past history was significant for a surgical procedure for fibrocystoma of her right humerus 20 years ago, and she had donated one of her kidneys to a relative 7 years previously. She had taken atorvastatin 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, and omega-3 fatty acid 1,000 mg daily for the past 3 years to treat high blood pressure and dyslipidemia. The patient had been misdiagnosed with a thyroid nodule and hypothyroidism at another hospital 4 years previously and had immediately been prescribed levothyroxine 50 \u00b5g/day. At that time, the thyroid ultrasonography revealed two nodules that were 0.3 and 0.5 cm in diameter on her right lobe and another nodule that was 2.3\u00d71.3 cm in size that was projected backwards. She had fine needle aspiration cytology for the nodule on the left lobe, and this had revealed a benign nodule. She had been followed up every 6 months by neck ultrasonography. Two years later, when the nodule on the left lobe of the thyroid had increased in size to 2.9\u00d71.7 cm, they carried out radiofrequency ablation. However, the thyroid nodule remained the same size even after the radiofrequency ablation, so they monitored its size every 6 months for 2 more years (). During that time, the patient began experiencing backache and visited the orthopedics department of our hospital where she was suspected of having metabolic bone disease due to the high serum ALP value.\nThe patient presented with generalized weakness and fatigue without other hypercalcemic symptoms. The peripheral blood examination was as follows: leukocyte count, 7,020/mm3; hemoglobin, 9.3 g/dL; platelet count, 249,000/mm3; prothrombin time (PT), 14.4 seconds (normal range, 11.9 to 14.3); activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 31.3 seconds (normal range, 29.1 to 43.5); serum iron, 65 \u00b5g/dL (normal range, 40 to 160); total iron binding capacity (TIBC), 258 \u00b5g/dL (normal range, 230 to 430); transferrin saturation, 25%; and ferritin, 158.6 ng/mL (normal range, 13 to 150). Serum chemistry values were also obtained: blood urea nitrogen, 26.9 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.98 mg/dL; glucose, 110 mg/dL; ALP, 1,011 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 23 U/L; and alanine aminotransferase, 11 U/L. Serum calcium was 14.6 mg/dL, phosphate was 3.5 mg/dL, and ionized calcium was 7.2 mg/dL. Serum protein and serum albumin were 6.9 and 3.7 g/dL, respectively. The results of the serum electrolyte test revealed that sodium was 135.7 mmol/L, potassium was 4.3 mmol/L, chloride was 104.0 mmol/L, and serum osmotic pressure was 286 mOsm/kg. According to the serum lipid examination, the total cholesterol was 146 mg/dL, triglyceride was 95 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein was 33 mg/dL, and low density lipoprotein was 79 mg/dL. A thyroid function test found T3 was 108.9 ng/dL (normal range, 80 to 200), thyroid stimulating hormone was 0.40 mIU/L (normal range, 0.27 to 4.2), and free T4 was 0.74 ng/dL (normal range, 0.93 to 1.70). Under dual energy X-ray absorptiometry-based bone density examination, the T-score of the lumbar region was -1.4, while the T-scores of the neck were -1.2 on the left and -1.8 on the right. Except for the fifth lumbar vertebra, which had spondylolisthesis, nothing remarkable was found on magnetic resonance imaging.\nAccording to further blood tests, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was 9.6 ng/mL (normal range, 4.8 to 52.8), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was 10.5 pg/mL (normal range, 19.6 to 54.3), while the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was 1,911 pg/mL (normal range, 15 to 65). When we performed bone scanning with 99mTc, the amount of cortical bone radioactive isotope uptake increased very high (). Because we suspected hyperparathyroidism, we carried out a 99mTc sestamibi scan and suspected the lesion that had been previously diagnosed as a left thyroid nodule was likely a parathyroid adenoma (). Using thyroid Doppler ultrasonography, we discovered a hypervascular adenoma that was 5-cm-sized solid mass with similar echo of surrounding thyroid tissue in the center, and slightly low echo in outer part in the inferior site of left thyroid gland (), while on the right thyroid parenchyma we discovered two thyroid nodules, 0.3 and 0.5 cm each in diameter, that the patient had had 4 years before. We performed neck computed tomography and found there was no neck lymph node metastastasis and local invasion of other organs ().\nThe patient received both hydration and diuretic treatments until she underwent a surgical operation to control the hypercalcemia; she also had pamidronate 90 mg intravenous injections twice a week. On the 11th day after hydration and diuretic treatment, her condition had improved; serum calcium was reduced to 11.6 mg/dL, and creatinine improved to 1.11 mg/dL. On the 12th day, the patient had left parathyroid excision and was diagnosed with a parathyroid adenoma (). Following the surgical procedure, iPTH normalized to 42.5 pg/mL, but calcium and vitamin D were prescribed for 9 months to cure the hypocalcemia that had developed due to hungry bone syndrome. It has been a year since the surgical operation, and her calcium, phosphate, ALP, and iPTH all remain at normal levels. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 22-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of heavy menstrual bleeding for 10 days. Blood loss was severe, requiring around 4\u20135 tampon changes per day, and she complained of feeling dizzy and weak. She was unmarried and had no history of similar menorrhagia.\nAbout 10 months earlier she had prolonged menstrual bleeding at that time, but as the menstrual cycle was normal and the bleeding was not very severe, she had not sought gynecological advice. About 3 weeks earlier she had experienced generalized muscle aches and joint pains (especially involving the upper and lower extremities), along with low-grade fever and bleeding from the gums. She had visited a primary healthcare center, where laboratory examination showed thrombocytopenia (50,000 dL) and anemia (6.5 g/dL). Dengue fever was suspected, and she was given a blood transfusion.\nAt our hospital she was initially admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology emergency department because of the severe menstrual bleeding. However, after ultrasound examination ruled out gynecological abnormalities, she was referred to the internal medicine department. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, but the conjunctiva was pale, and her hair showed a tendency to fall out easily. Multiple erythematous macules were present on the skin; however, there was no \u201cbutterfly rash\u201d on the face. Systemic examination was otherwise normal.\nHemogram showed the following: hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL; hematocrit 36%; MCV 76.4 fL; MCHC 31.4 g/dL; serum iron 45 \u00b5g/dL; TIBC 279 \u00b5g/dL; transferrin saturation 16%; thrombocyte count 55,200/dL; and leucocyte count 7,310/dL (with normal differential count). Kidney function tests showed normal serum urea and creatinine levels, with eGFR of 129.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation). The random blood glucose level was 105 mg/dL. The lipid profile showed total cholesterol, 218 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein 161 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein 27 mg/dL; and triglyceride 150 mg/dL. Liver function tests and serum electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Coagulation function tests showed partial thromboplastin time 9.7 s (11.3); activated partial thromboplastin time 31.8 s (34.7); fibrinogen level 429.9 mg/dL; and D-dimer 0.2 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody was positive at a titer of 1/1,000, with C3 86.4 mg/dL, C4 15.4 mg/dL, CRP 2.4 mg/dL, and anti-dsDNA 614.5 IU/mL. Lactic acid dehydrogenase was 464 U/L, reticulocyte count 1.42%, immature platelet fraction 6.7%, and serum albumin 3.87 g/dL. Urinalysis showed a large number of erythrocytes, epithelial cells, and amorphous crystals. Proteinuria was present (2+). Total 24-h protein excretion was 1,148 mg. Kidney ultrasound examination was done as a part of routine examination, which revealed bilateral dilatation of the pelvicalyceal systems showing hydronephrosis grade 1 on the left kidney (Fig. ) and grade 2 on the right kidney (Fig. ) without evidence of kidney cyst or stones. Moreover, ultrasound examination on the urinary bladder shows an increased bladder wall thickness (Fig. ).\nBased on these findings, we diagnosed SLE complicated by lupus nephritis and lupus cystitis. Treatment was started with intravenous methylprednisolone (62.5 mg/day; 1.5 mg/kg/day). The vaginal bleeding stopped within 2 days, and the patient's general condition improved. Laboratory parameters also showed good response to corticosteroid therapy. After 5 days of intravenous therapy, the patient was switched to oral methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day). She was discharged from hospital on the 8th day, with the advice to continue methylprednisolone at the same dose and she is scheduled for follow-up after 1 month.

His family history was positive for cardiovascular disease as his father had fatal MI at a young age.\nPast medical records depicted that he was admitted to a local hospital in 2014 with a diagnosis of right-sided weakness secondary to cerebrovascular accielectrocardiogram dent. The magnetic resonance imaging scans of brain showed an acute infarction of area supplied by the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Magnetic resonance angiography of the circle of Willis depicted occlusion of the left MCA at the horizontal M1 segment. The extracranial arteries did not show any abnormalities like plaque formation on evaluation by cervical echography. After initial management with intravenous (IV) aspirin, the patient was administered with IV clopidogrel. Long-term anticoagulation was not prescribed since no cause was identified. There were no complications and the patient\u2019s hemiparesis gradually improved during the following months. Later in 2017, he developed SOB with acute retrosternal chest pain. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4. Troponin T was raised up to 7,120 ng/L [normal (N)= 0-14]. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed moderate left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, concentric LV hypertrophy, regional wall motion abnormities and mild mitral regurgitation (Figure ). The patient was initially administered with xylocaine, heparin, nitroglycerine, atropine, metoprolol, clopidogrel and loop diuretics. Cardiac catheterization revealed total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery for which the patient underwent primary angioplasty to LAD with a drug-eluting stent. After adequate management, the patient was discharged on aspirin, clopidogrel, bisoprolol, rosuvastatin, spironolactone, hydroxyzine and loop diuretics.\nOn examination, his blood pressure (BP) was 165/90 mmHg, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute and heart rate was 70 beats per minute with no arrhythmia. General physical examination revealed palmar erythema, splinter hemorrhages and mild pedal edema. The SOB of New York Heart Association class III along with orthopnea was accompanied by productive cough and hemoptysis. Apex beat could not be palpated while lung fields were found to be clear on auscultation. Neurological examination showed no focal neurological deficits with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15. Other systemic examinations were insignificant.\nLaboratory evaluation on admission revealed hemoglobin of 14.5 g/dL (N=13.8-17.2), total leukocyte count of 7 x 109/L (N=4-11), platelet count of 249 x 109/L (N=150-400), prothrombin time of 10.7 seconds (N=11-13.5), activated partial thromboplastin time of 16.7 seconds (N=26-36) and international normalized ratio of 1.10 (N\u2264 1.1). Serum electrolytes were normal, and creatinine was documented to be 0.8 mg/dL (N=0.6-1.2). Total bilirubin, albumin and globulin levels were within the normal range. Lipid profile was also normal with serum cholesterol of 114 mg/dL (N< 200), low-density lipoprotein of 55 mg/dL (N=60-130), high-density lipoprotein of 60 mg/dL (N=60), and triglyceride level of 75 mg/dL (N<150). However troponin I levels were raised up to 0.1 ng/mL (N\u2264 0.04).\nThe initial ECG had 1-2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads I, V2-V5 and aVL with ST-segment depression in reciprocal leads (Figure ). Chest X-ray showed an enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse pulmonary edema (Figure ). The patient was initially managed with ascard, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, valsartan, bisoprolol, spironolactone,and omeprazole.\nTTE showed dilated LV with moderate dysfunction, akinetic LV apex, apical mid interventricular septum and inferior wall, and an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. Carotid Doppler and duplex study of neck vessels (common carotid, external carotid, internal carotid and vertebral arteries) were found to be normal. Cardiac catheterization revealed a patent stent and thrombotic occlusion of the LAD. Considering the past history of stroke and MI in this young patient, blood samples were sent for a detailed coagulation profile. The serum homocysteine level was found to be 10 \u00b5mol/L (N=4-15), while factor V Leiden was also negative. Deficiency of PC and PS was finally diagnosed; values seen were 41.9% (N=70-123) and 53% (N=70-140), respectively.\nAlthough the patient recovered from SOB and pedal edema, the EF showed no improvement despite adequate antiplatelet therapy. The BP also dropped to 100/70 mmHg. The patient was discharged with anticoagulants, diuretics, beta-blockers and nitrates. The patient was advised for regular follow-ups, but unfortunately, he could not maintain follow-ups. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

The pain was intermittent, not related to eating, and lasted for 3 days prior to admission. He had no fever, nausea, vomiting, or other gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient also denied any history of abdominal trauma or surgeries. On arrival, blood pressure was 156/104 mm Hg, and heart rate was 80 beats per minute (). His abdomen was soft, non-tender and non-distended, and with normal bowel sounds. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. The patient had a normal complete blood count (CBC), coagulation panel, and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). Lipid panel showed a total cholesterol level of 221 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein of 153 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein of 46 mg/dL, and triglyceride of 110 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a short (1.7 cm) segment dissection of the superior mesenteric artery with mild induration of the adjacent fat (). The distal branches of the SMA appeared patent. The patient was treated conservatively with bowel rest, fluid resuscitation, intravenous heparin, and serial abdominal examinations. Home antihypertensive medications including daily amlodipine 5 mg, lisinopril 20 mg, and triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide 37.5-25 mg were resumed and his blood pressure was well controlled throughout admission ().

    "question": "Case 1 is a 47-year-old male who recalls gradually worsening illness starting around the age of 25 that he partially attributes to poor food choices and opioid use. By the age of 36, he recalls knowing that he had \u201cundeniable, serious illness,\u201d and by the age of 38, he weighed over 400 pounds and suffered from severe sleep apnea, asthma and trouble breathing, eczema, allergies, hypertension (SBP/DBP = 255/155 on 2 medications), high total cholesterol (300 mg/dL), high triglycerides (279 mg/dL), and chronic shoulder and joint pain. He had difficulty moving and completing basic activities of daily living, such as putting on his shoes. He was on a number of medications that cost him approximately USD 7680 out of pocket, annually, while his insurance company paid a total of USD 19,646 for medications in 2009 alone. In addition to seeing a physician at least once every 1\u20132 weeks for his various conditions, he attended monthly appointments to aspirate fluid from his knees, had multiple visits to the ER, underwent shoulder surgery, and had one ankle reconstruction surgery with a second one imminent. Around 2012, at the age of 38, he decided to pursue gastric bypass surgery; however, his physician did not clear him to undergo the procedure, due to his poor underlying health. This event, combined with the recent deaths of two close family members, is what ultimately prompted him to begin considering lifestyle changes to improve his health. Initially, his approach to change was \u201cgoing one step further than the day before.\u201d First, he forced himself to simply get up from his chair once, and then twice per day, and then he progressed to being able to go on walks and walk up the stairs. He began researching additional lifestyle changes and watched documentaries, such as Forks Over Knives, which he describes as providing an entirely new perspective on food. He adopted dietary changes that began with a green juice fast followed by calorie restrictions, reducing red meat, and changing from full to lower fat dairy. On 1 January 2013, he adopted a strict, whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) dietary pattern. Thus, what started initially as a set of small lifestyle changes ultimately fostered a completely new lifestyle approach\u2014one where fitness and plant-based eating were the focus. Approximately 6 months into the lifestyle change, Case 1 had lost 150\u2013200 pounds, and although he does not recall his exact numbers, his cholesterol was cut in half, and triglyceride levels were in the normal range. By 2015, his cholesterol was 112 mg/dL and triglycerides were 74 mg/dL. In just 3\u20134 years, he went from barely standing up from a chair to running his first marathon in May 2016; by 2017, he was completing Ironman competitions and later ran an ultra-marathon. His current laboratory values as of 20 May 2021 include a total cholesterol of 103 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dL, triglycerides 61 mg/dL, non-HDL cholesterol 67 mg/dL, and blood pressure 122/78. Post lifestyle change, he also notes significant improvement in his level of happiness and quality of life, specifically with respect to being able to enjoy time with his family, traveling, and gaining a new outlook on life.\nAside from the possibility of gastric bypass surgery (USD 18,000\u201335,000) [], Case 1 was a candidate for a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine for obstructive sleep apnea (USD 1000\u20133000) [] and a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) machine for pain management (approximately USD 100\u2013500) [] prior to his lifestyle change, highlighting an approximate average savings of USD 28,800 in discreet medical costs potentially avoided. Post lifestyle change, he reports spending only USD 61 per year on medications (B12 injections), as opposed to his previous approximated average spending of USD 7600+ in annual medication costs. Pharmaceutical costs covered by his insurance company decreased from USD 19,000+ in 2009 to USD 122.24 in 2015 and 2016 combined. In addition, his grocery costs are approximately half of what they were prior to his lifestyle change. What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

    "question": "A 37-year-old young female patient presented with progressive dyspnea, hypoxia, and left lung consolidation. She had presented to our emergency department, with a 3-day history of shortness of breath, fever, and nonproductive cough. Her past medical history included recently diagnosed and untreated Hepatitis C, related to prolonged intravenous heroin abuse. She was on methadone de-addiction program but was continuing to occasionally using heroin, the last time a week prior to admission. She was also an active smoker, with a 20 pack-year history.\nOn clinical examination she appeared malnourished and dehydrated, with multiple skin tattoos and burn marks on the left forearm. Temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, respiratory rate 30/Min, blood pressure 90/50 mmHg, pulse rate 120 beats/min, oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Heart sounds were dual, with no added sounds or murmurs. There were no crackles or wheezes audible on auscultation but air entry was markedly reduced on the left side. Routine laboratory investigations showed a hemoglobin of 99 g/L. white cell count 23.7 \u00d7 109/L with a neutrophil count of 22.75 \u00d7 109/L, and lymphocytes of 0.79 \u00d7 109/L, CRP 206 mg/L, Alanine transaminase (ALT) 26 U/L, Aspartate transaminase (AST) 18 U/L, urea 3.5 mmol/L, creatinine 42 \u03bcmol/L. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed complete left-sided consolidation with no mediastinal shift [Figures and ]. Venous access was obtained via central cannulation of the internal jugular vein and she was resuscitated with 2 L of normal saline, started on ticaricillin/caluvulanate 3.1 g 6 hourly and referred to intensive care unit for admission with a presumptive diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia.\nDespite adequate fluid resuscitation, the patient remained hypotensive with decreasing urine output, and noradrenalin infusion was initiated to improve blood pressure. She was intubated for worsening tachypnea and fatigue. Prior to intubation, chest computed tomography (CT) was performed, which confirmed consolidation of both the lobes on the left side; interestingly, no foreign body was described on the initial CT report, but detected on review after bronchoscopy [Figures and ]. Serology was drawn to assess for Hepatitis, HIV, and atypical infection. The antibiotic regime was augmented with the addition of vancomycin and azythromycin.\nIn view of the history of intravenous drug abuse a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which demonstrated mild tricuspid regurgitation, no vegetations, and normal cardiac function. The patient was ventilated on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation volume control mode, with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, Peak end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 and FiO2 of 0.5. There was only a minimal endotracheal aspirate and a repeat CXR showed the persistence of the left lobe consolidation with no improvement inspite of mechanical ventiltion. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed on day 2 to obtain diagnostic specimens and to look for any airway obstruction by mucous plugging. Bronchoscopy unexpectedly revealed a nearly completely obstructed left main bronchus by a foreign body, which resembled an earring. The foreign body was pulled out using a biopsy forceps. The foreign body became lodged in the endotracheal tube (ETT) necessitating removal of the ETT and foreign body en masse and reintubating the patient with a new ETT. On closer examination of the foreign body was a 25G hypodermic needle []. Subsequent CXR showed clearing of consolidation and the patient was extubated on day 4 and transferred to medical ward for further management. Sputum culture during bronchoscopy also yielded Pseudomonoas aeroginosa, which was sensitive to ticaricillin/caluvulanate. Antibiotics were de-escalated, and the patient was discharged on day 6 with oral antibiotics []. On questioning, it became apparent that she inhaled drugs from the same table she kept her drug paraphernalia. It seemed that while snorting drugs, she inadvertently inhaled the hypodermic needle.

    "question": "An 18-year-old Black female who had been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, subsequently suffering frequent pain crises and undergoing repeated transfusions, presented to the emergency room with a 21-day history of progressive lower limb oedema accompanied by dyspnoea and orthopnoea. In addition, she reported a 3-day history of severe chest pain, together with a productive cough and fever as high as 38 \u00b0C. She reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, she was found to be very pallid and normotensive (blood pressure, 130/80 mmHg), with a heart rate of 104 bpm, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, as well as being found to have developed anasarca. One month prior, she had undergone outpatient laboratory tests, which had shown that her renal function was normal\u2014with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.75 mg/dl and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease\u2013Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD\u2013EPI) equation, of 134.9 ml/min/1.73 m2\u2014urine analysis showing no haematuria or proteinuria.\nBlood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 6.1 g/dl; haematocrit, 18.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; reticulocyte fraction, 6.11%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 433 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.36 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 18,820 cells/mm3; neutrophil count, 13,630 cells/mm3; lymphocyte count, 2790 cells/mm3; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm3; and urea, 29 mg/dl. The patient showed signs of hyperfiltration, including a serum creatinine concentration of 0.49 mg/dl and a CKD\u2013EPI-determined eGFR of 148.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. A urine sample was found to contain 100 leucocytes/field and 70 erythrocytes/field. In addition, 24-h proteinuria was 8.99 g. Further analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 3.9 g/dl; albumin, 1.2 g/dl; globulins, 2.7 g/dl; total cholesterol, 210 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 114 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 37 mg/dl; triglycerides, 205 mg/dl; C4, 26.1 mg/dl (normal range, 10\u201338 mg/dl); C3, 62 mg/dl (normal range, 73\u2013149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 24.9 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The patient also tested negative for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia and an anti-streptolysin O level of 816 IU/ml (normal range, < 200 IU/ml). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed mild congestion and infiltrate in the right lung base. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.\nGiven the clinical presentation, the diagnostic hypothesis was pneumonia and anasarca due to nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. The patient was started on ceftriaxone (1 g, twice daily). Computed tomography angiography of the chest ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and acute chest syndrome, thus indirectly confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia.\nAfter the infection had been controlled, the patient underwent renal biopsy. Light microscopy revealed 7 glomeruli with global endocapillary proliferation; neutrophil and macrophage infiltrate (Fig. a); synechiae in 10% of the glomeruli; occasional splitting of the glomerular basement membrane; and a preserved Bowman\u2019s capsule. The tubules were dilated, with foci of epithelial regeneration and neutrophils within their lumina. There was focal oedema in the interstitium. The interlobular arteries had a normal aspect, with intimal proliferation in the arterioles. Immunofluorescence performed on frozen sections showed intensity of deposition of C3 (2+/3+), IgG (1+/3+), IgA (1+/3+) and lambda light chains (1+/3+), with a granular pattern, distributed diffusely throughout the capillary loop. Collectively, the histological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of APIGN accompanied by microangiopathic changes related to the underlying disease.\nTreatment with a diuretic and an anti-proteinuric agent (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was instituted, and the patient evolved to clinical improvement (normalisation of blood pressure, as well as resolution of the proteinuria and haematuria). However, the signs of hyperfiltration persisted even after resolution of the proteinuria. In the final evaluation, the serum creatinine concentration was 0.33 mg/dl and the CKD\u2013EPI-determined eGFR was 187.8 ml/min/1.73 m2. Evolution of laboratorial tests are available in Fig. .

So, differential diagnosis was extended and complementary exams were ordered: plasmatic amylase 96 U/L (reference range: 28\u2013100 U/L), lipase 17 U/L (13\u201360 U/L), TSH 0.024 \u03bcIU/L (adult reference range: 0.27\u20134.2 \u03bcIU/L), free-T4 2.16 ng/dL (reference range: 0.82\u20131.63 ng/dL), total-T3 0.18 ng/mL (reference range: 0.5\u20132.0 ng/mL), free-T3 0.42 pg/mL (reference range: 2.1\u20133.8 pg/mL); CPK-MB 101.3 U/L (reference range: 0\u201325 U/L), total CPK 505.7 U/L (normal: 39\u2013308 U/L); troponin T 25.0 ng/mL (reference range: 0.12\u20130.6 ng/mL). Based on these results, hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 h, methimazole 20 mg every 8 h, and Lugol\u2019s solution 10 drops every 8 h, were added on the second day of treatment. Because of shock, beta-blocker was not administered. On the third day of treatment a good evolution was observed, norepinephrine and insulin infusion were discontinued, and NPH insulin was initiated. Based on physical examination, chest x-ray (CXR) ( and ), and progressive decrease in partial oxygen pressure () compatible with acute lung edema, intravenous furosemide 20 mg every 12 h was administered for 2 days.\nAlthough ECG was normal, troponin determinations were repeated over the next days and persisted elevated. Echocardiography (5 September 2017) showed borderline pulmonary artery systolic pressure (35 mm Hg), severe LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction 35%), diastolic dysfunction of restrictive type and global hypokinesia ().\nOn the 6th day of treatment, hydrocortisone and Lugol\u2019s solution were stopped, and methimazole was reduced by half. The patient was discharged on 7 September 2017, with almost complete recovery.\nWe also performed other complementary exams: Twenty-four hour-urine sodium, chloride, and potassium levels were also normal. Direct stool examination showed 0\u20131 leucocytes/HPF, no parasites, no blood, no erythrocytes. Urine culture and HIV serology was negative. Anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were negative. Cardiac catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy were not performed. Follow-up echocardiography at 6 months was completely normal. After the patient was discharged, no additional (blood or imaging) study was performed, other than echocardiography.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this article and accompanying images.

    "question": "An 85-year-old male presented to our hospital with a 2-month history of a productive cough with white phlegm and a 2-day history of hemoptysis in October 2014. He reported no fever, chest pain, chills, night sweats, or dyspnea.\nOn physical examination, the patient was afebrile. His heart rate was 80 beats per minute and regular, blood pressure 136/72 mm Hg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. He was alert and not in acute distress. There was no lymphadenopathy in the neck. The lungs were clear and there were no heart murmurs. His abdomen was not tender, and there was no organomegaly. The neurological examination was unremarkable.\nThe patient's white blood cell (WBC) count was 3430/mL, with 51.3% neutrophils, 32.9% lymphocytes, and 10.8% monocytes; his hemoglobin was 117 g/L; his hematocrit was 38.9%; and his platelet count was 207,000/mL. The patient's C-reactive protein (CRP) level was normal. Serum chemistry tests showed the following results: sodium, 142.3 mmol/L; potassium, 3.9 mmol/L; chloride, 106.2 mmol/L; blood urea nitrogen, 5.9 mmol/L; creatinine, 86.3 \u03bcmol/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 21 U/L (normal range 15\u201340 U/L); and alanine aminotransferase, 16 U/L (normal range 9\u201350 U/L). The international normalized ratio was 1.02, the partial-thromboplastin time was 27.1 seconds, and the d-dimer level was 180 \u03bcg/L. The brain natriuretic peptide was 17.0 pg/mL; tumor marker tests revealed: carcinoembryonic antigen, 2.32 ng/mL; squamous cell carcinoma antigen, 0.90 ng/mL; neuron-specific enolase, 6.24 ng/mL; and CY211, 2.25 \u03bcg/L.\nComputed tomography (CT) revealed a mass in the right lower lobe (Fig. A). Electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm, with a ventricular rate of 79 beats per minute. No metastatic lesions were found on brain magnetic resonance imaging or in bone using emission CT.\nThe hemoptysis was treated with 30 mg of ambroxol and 600 mg of p-aminomethyl benzoic acid daily. Sputum cultures were negative. Lung function tests after inhaling 400 \u03bcg of albuterol yielded an FEV1/FVC = 59.7% and FEV1 = 46.2%. Bronchoscopy showed stenosis in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (Fig. ). A CT-guided transthoracic needle lung biopsy showed SCLC after histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations (Fig. ).\nSeven days after the transthoracic needle lung biopsy, the patient's temperature increased to 40\u00b0C and he developed a worsening cough with purulent sputum. Repeat laboratory tests showed a WBC count of 13,890/mL, with 87.0% neutrophils, 6.5% lymphocytes, and 0.9% monocytes; hemoglobin, 128 g/L; hematocrit, 38.70%; platelet count, 138,000/mL; and CRP, 88.0 mg/L. The patient was treated with cefuroxime (1.5 g) twice per day for 7 days and his WBC and CRP level normalized.\nHe refused radiotherapy or chemotherapy. After obtaining consent, we treated the tumor with RFA. Before RFA, we evaluated the size and spatial relationships of the tumor using CT and determined the needle angle and depth via the shortest route from the surface to the mass. The puncture point was infiltrated with 5 mL of 2% lidocaine. The multipolar needle was directed to avoid bone, large blood vessels, and pulmonary bullae. A rapid biopsy of the lung tumor was performed. Heating was directed to an area within 0.5 to 1 cm of the tumor margin and to the needle track (Fig. B). After closing the puncture wound, repeat CT showed pneumothorax (Fig. C), which was treated with bed rest and inhaled oxygen. The patient had some chest pain the next day, but there was no fever or hemoptysis in the first week after RFA.\nAt the 2-year follow-up examination, the efficacy of the RFA was evaluated as a partial response (PR) (Fig. D\u2013G). The patient was last seen in January 2017, when he developed community-acquired pneumonia (Fig. H). What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

After basic laboratory investigations, kidney biopsy was performed. Histological examination with light microscope revealed a global sclerosed glomeruli, minimal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy []. A diagnosis of glomerulonephritis of unknown etiology was made and treatment with mycophenolate (1 g PO twice daily) and prednisone (20 mg PO once daily) was initiated.\nAfter 3 months, the patient presented with a 3-week history of fever, abdominal pain and fatigue. The fever was subjective, intermittent, associated with chills and rigors, especially at night, and not relieved by paracetamol. The abdominal pain was intermittent, diffuse and colicky in nature and was associated with nausea and vomiting without blood (2\u20133 times/day). During these 3 weeks, the patient's appetite decreased, owing to which he lost 7 kg in weight. In addition, the patient reported a history of animal contact (goat and sheep), ingestion of raw goat milk and swimming in the valley water. There was no history of rash, cough, hemoptysis, jaundice, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, change in urine color, arthralgia, visual disturbances, oral ulcers, genital rash, discharge or contact with tuberculosis patients.\nOn physical examination, the patient was found to be obese, sweating, not jaundiced or cyanosed. He was conscious, alert and oriented to time, place and person. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 38.6\u00b0C; pulse rate, 98 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; blood pressure, 125/85 mmHg; and oxygen saturation, 100% on room air. He was pale, with normal jugular venous pressure and no oral ulcers or thrush. Abdominal examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness and a palpable liver 4 cm below the costal margin with a 15-cm liver span. The rest of the examinations were within normal limits.\nLaboratory investigations on admission revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.65/mcL (neutrophils, 72.1%; lymphocytes, 23.2%; monocytes, 4%; and eosinophils, 0.7%). Results of other hematological examinations were as follows: hemoglobin level, 8.8 g/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 88 mm/h; platelet count, 87,000/mcL; and reticulocyte count, 1.28%.

International normalized ratio was 0.8. Renal function tests showed that blood urea nitrogen was 12 mg/dL and creatinine 2.15 mg/dL. Level of lactate dehydrogenase was 732 U/L and C-reactive protein 53 mg/L. Urine analysis showed 2\u20135 WBCs/high-power field and 10\u201325 red blood cells/high-power field with no nitrites. Sickling test and direct/indirect Coombs test were negative, and the stool test result was normal.\nChest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged liver (16.2-cm liver span) and a mildly enlarged spleen (14 cm in length). Kidneys were normal in size, with a mild increase in the echogenicity of renal parenchyma, but no hydronephrosis or ascites.\nThe serological tests for viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma and Brucella were negative. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome A and B antibodies and cryoglobulin were negative. Malaria smear and blood cultures were also negative.\nThe patient's condition continued to deteriorate and he developed continuous fever of up to 40.5\u00b0C. Repeated tests after 5 days revealed the following: WBC, 1.4/mcL; hemoglobin, 6.7 g/dL; platelet, 55,000/mcL; creatinine, 3.3 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 151 mg/L; total bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase, 460 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 80 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 138 IU/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase, 651 IU/L; albumin, 2.5 g/dL; and lactate dehydrogenase, 1400 U/L.\nBone marrow aspirate showed mild hypocellular marrow with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. Bone marrow culture for Brucella was negative. Further, Leishman-Donovan bodies were not detected by light microscope. Polymerase-chain reaction test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, serological tests for dengue fever and Q fever as well as \u03b2-D-Glucan and galactomannan antigen tests were all negative. Liver biopsy showed granulomatous hepatitis with extramedullary hematopoiesis. After 1 week of admission, the patient was treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotic (meropenem intravenously, 1 g every 8 h for 6 days); however, there was no improvement.\nAdditional serological testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) releveled the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies. Based on this, the patient was started on liposomal amphotericin B course as a treatment for VL (4 mg/kg intravenous on Days 1\u20135, 10, 17, 24, 31 and 38), despite the lack of a definitive diagnosis. After 1 week, the patient improved clinically, the fever subsided, the laboratory parameters began to improve and at the end of liposomal amphotericin B course, all tests returned to normal.

Other abnormal laboratory results included an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 80 U/L (normal: 7-52 U/L), a lipase level of 473 U/L (normal: 11-82 U/L), an alkaline phosphatase (AP) level of 173 U/L (normal: 34-104 U/L), a troponin level of 113 pg/mL (normal: 0-20 pg/ml), and a creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level of 1,103 U/L (normal: 38-174 U/L). Urine analysis showed large red-blood cells and proteinuria. Arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.22 (7.35-7.45), a pCO2 level of 25 mmHg (normal: 35-45 mmHg), and a paO2 level of 79 mmHg (normal: 75-100 mmHg), while patient receiving oxygen therapy through high-flow nasal canula at 60% fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2). Lactic acid levels, lipid profile, total bilirubin, and coagulation studies were within normal limits, and urine toxicology screen was negative for recreational substances. Initial chest radiography (CXR) showed left lung opacity with consolidation (Figures , ). A critical care medicine evaluation was requested, and the patient was admitted to ICU with the diagnosis of severe sepsis with septic shock likely resulting from CAP. Aggressive intravenous fluids resuscitation and vasopressors (norepinephrine, vasopressin) were initiated on arrival to ICU, and the patient was subsequently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation because of worsening tachypnea and increased FIO2 requirements. Empiric intravenous antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone (2 g daily) and azithromycin (500 mg daily) was initiated, along with steroids (hydrocortisone 50 mg intravenously every six hours) and intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) infusion.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia without ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with a normal right ventricular systolic function. Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed a normal gallbladder with a normal common bile duct. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with oral contrast revealed mild peripancreatic fat stranding suggestive of non-complicated pancreatitis and duodenitis and confirmed the presence of a left lung base consolidation.\nBlood culture and respiratory culture were negative. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative. Legionella as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae urine antigens, by immunochromatographic assay, were reported to be positive.\nOn day three of ICU admission, vasopressors were titrated off, metabolic acidosis had resolved, and the patient's creatinine,liver chemistries, and CPK levels were trending downward. The patient's FIO2 requirements were decreased to 45%, and he was extubated on day five of ICU admission. After 48 hours, he was transferred to a medical ward. The patient completed a total of 10 days of intravenous antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin 500 mg daily. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

    "question": "A 30-year-old Chinese female, G3P2002 at 26 weeks and 2 days gestation, presented to the Emergency Department complaining of shortness of breath and a dry cough that started one week prior. She had no sick contacts or recent travel history and denied obstetrical complaints. Her history was significant for chronic hepatitis B and two prior vaginal deliveries. She appeared critically ill, with vitals as follows: febrile to 39.3\u00b0C, tachycardic to 128 beats per minute, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, hypotensive to 88/55 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Pertinent laboratory findings included WBC 7.0 K/\u03bcL, an initial neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratio of 7.25, hemoglobin/hematocrit of 9.1 g/dL/28.1%, ESR of 50 mm/hr, procalcitonin of 178 pg/mL, CRP level of 69.6 mg/L, AST 14, ALT 32, and a BUN/creatinine ratio of 4 mg/dL/0.59. Her chest X-ray showed evidence of multifocal pneumonia (). On initial obstetrical evaluation, a sonogram confirmed a male fetus in cephalic presentation, with an estimated fetal weight of 910 g. The biophysical profile (BPP) score was 8/8. She was admitted for management of sepsis secondary to suspected COVID-19 infection.\nThis patient underwent a septic work up including NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, respiratory viral panel, MRSA culture, legionella and streptococcus pneumoniae testing, blood cultures, and a urine culture. There was no clear etiology for her hypoxia, including negative SARS-CoV-2 testing, but was significant for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which was treated with cefpodoxime. Given the high clinical suspicion of COVID 19, SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated but remained negative.\nWithin the first two days of admission the patient continued to deteriorate with increased work of breathing, increased oxygen requirements, and mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. On hospital day (HD) 3 her WBC increased to 10.6 K/\u03bcL and trended to 21.6 K/\u03bcL by HD9. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was 16.41, lymphocyte percentage was 5%, and CRP was 187 mg/dL. She received ceftriaxone and was started on azithromycin for presumed community acquired pneumonia. She was evaluated by the critical care team for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure despite treatment with a nonrebreather mask and high-flow oxygen and was intubated on hospital day (HD) 4 with transfer to the ICU. A third SARS-CoV-2 test remained negative.\nAn interdisciplinary team including medicine, pulmonary, anesthesia, neonatology, and obstetrics with maternal fetal medicine guided clinical decision-making. It was felt that delivery would not provide maternal or fetal benefit; therefore, magnesium sulfate and antenatal steroids were not given.\nIn the ICU, she received a norepinephrine drip due to hemodynamic instability, propofol for sedation purposes, rocuronium for paralysis, and insulin drip for glycemic control, and heparin prophylaxis was initiated. She received 50 mg of methylprednisolone four times daily for 25 days, which was tapered over several days. Her acidosis was addressed and corrected with a goal pH of 7.4-7.47. She exhibited persistent leukocytosis, and her antibiotic coverage was changed to meropenem. She intermittently required blood transfusions for anemia to maintain a hemoglobin level above 7 mg/dL. Initially, she failed to maintain good oxygenation with worsening radiographic findings, and her ventilation settings were adjusted accordingly with increasing PEEP settings (maximum set at 16). Two additional SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were repeated and were still negative. The patient then underwent a bronchoscopy on HD 14 with a bronchoalveolar lavage, and the fluid culture yielded no growth.\nThe question regarding delivery versus expectant management was revisited multiple times, and maternal fetal medicine recommended that a cesarean section only be performed if the patient continued to deteriorate despite maximum ventilation settings. In terms of antenatal monitoring, we could not implement continuous electronic fetal monitoring due to lack of remote monitoring capabilities and training limitations of the ICU house staff. Instead, we performed daily biophysical profiles to assess fetal status. We observed a score of 4/8 on HD16 (points removed for breathing and movement) that was attributed to an increase in the propofol and rocuronium titrations. The ICU team subsequently decreased the dosing which resulted in improved findings on the biophysical profile 2 days later. A sonographic estimated fetal weight (EFW) was measured on HD20 at 1165 g (9.5% percentile by WHO fetal growth calculator). Umbilical artery Dopplers were performed twice weekly thereafter and remained normal. Her ventilation settings were slowly weaned down and she showed radiologic improvement. She was extubated on hospital day twenty-five.\nShe remained in the ICU for one week after her extubation and required high-flow oxygen that was slowly weaned down to a nasal cannula. She was transferred to the antepartum unit requiring 2 L/min oxygen on a nasal cannula. Sonographic EFW on HD33 was 1549 g (21 percentile by WHO fetal growth calculator). Meeting her recovery milestones, she was discharged home at 31 weeks gestation on HD 35 with no supplemental oxygen requirements. She was seen in the clinic 2 weeks after discharge and was doing very well. She then underwent testing for COVID-19 IgG antibodies and had a positive test result.\nShe was readmitted to the antepartum unit with preterm contractions and 3 cm cervical dilation at 34 weeks. She was given a course of betamethasone and monitored for preterm labor; she was discharged two days later after making no cervical change. She subsequently underwent weekly NST/BPPs (consistently 10/10) and monthly growths with an estimated fetal growth of 2962 g at 38 weeks and 4 days (28% by WHO fetal growth calculator). The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery at 39 weeks and 0 days gestation in labor and had an uncomplicated normal spontaneous vaginal delivery of a live male neonate in cephalic presentation. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1, and 5 minutes, respectively, the neonatal weight was 2830 g, with a base excess of -7.9 and an arterial pH of 7.18. The placental pathology findings included meconium staining, and patchy avascular villi suggestive of fetal vascular malperfusion. The mother and child were discharged home from the hospital two days after delivery with no complications. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

The patient is a milk vendor by occupation in rural Bangalore and routinely consumes unpasteurized or raw milk due to a belief that raw milk is healthier. The patient is an ex-smoker and alcoholic with consuming about 20 g (whiskey) per day from 10 years. Patient's medical records and history from relatives revealed fever with night sweats and pain abdomen from 2 months for which he was evaluated as fever of unknown origin. The patient denied any recent travel or contact with persons having a similar illness.\nHis physical examination during admission was remarkable for fever (40\u00b0C), hypotension (BP: 86/60 mmHg), and increased respiratory (30 min\u20131) and heart (120 min\u20131) rates. He was severely dehydrated and pale, but no scleral icterus, clubbing, cyanosis, edema or lymphadenopathy was noted. Systemic examination of the abdomen showed tenderness in the left hypochondriac region. The liver was nontender with normal span. The spleen was not palpable but castell's sign was elicited (dullness noted in lower eighth intercostal space on inspiration). Cardiovascular and respiratory system examination was normal. Nervous system examination was normal.\nInvestigations revealed total white blood cell count of 32 100 mm\u20133 (neutrophils 64%, lymphocytes 30%, eosinophils 3% and monocytes 3%), ESR of 100 mm/h, C-reactive protein of 92 mg/l, hemoglobin of 10 mg/dl and platelet count was 199 000 \u03bcm\u20131. The arterial blood gasses had pH of 7.36, a PO2 of 68 mmHg, PCO2 of 35.5 mmHg and 17.9 mmol/l of bicarbonate. Renal function test was abnormal with creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl and blood urea of 70 mg/dl. Liver function test was normal. Electrocardiogram showed tachycardia and nonspecific ST\u2013T changes in leads 2 and aVF. Echocardiography was normal with the ejection fraction of 60% and no features of endocarditis were found.\nBrucella slide and tube agglutination tests (Wright, at 1/640) were positive. Ultrasound abdomen and computerized tomography of the abdomen showed splenomegaly and well-demarcated hypodense lesion, which is nonenhancing and measuring 3.2 \u00d7 2.8 \u00d7 2.8 cm in the upper pole of spleen with perisplenic fat stranding. Blood cultures confirmed infection by Brucella melitensis on Day 1 and Day 3. Chest radiograph showed bilateral pleural effusion with basal atelectasis. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was normal. The patient was treated with percutaneous drainage along with oral doxycycline (200 mg/day) and rifampin (600 mg/day) for 6 weeks.\nThe patient improved symptomatically over a period of 10 days with the absence of fever and reduction of pain abdomen. The patient was discharged on Day 10 with advice for review ultrasound abdomen examinations. The patient remained asymptomatic without recurrence at 6 months after completion of treatment.

The patient's chest X-ray postero-anterior (PA) view at that time showed middle lobe consolidation []. The patient was treated as CAP with oral amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (625 mg) 8 hourly and levofloxacin (500 mg) daily was added afterwards. As the patient's condition deteriorated with documented weight loss of 5 Kg in 2 weeks, his father brought him to our hospital. On examination, the patient was very toxic with blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate 130/min regular, respiratory rate 32/min with moderate pallor. Examination of the respiratory system revealed crepitations in the right mammary area. Examinations of other systems were normal. We treated the case as non-resolving pneumonia and did antibiotics adjustment with the intravenous cefoperazone-sulbactam (1.5 g) 8 hourly and oral clarithromycin (500 mg) twice daily along with the other supporting treatment. The investigations revealed hemoglobin 6.4 g%, total white cell count 15200/mm3 with 94% neutrophils; fasting blood sugar 86 mg/dl, urea 45 mg/dl, creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, total bilirubin 0.96 mg/dl, alanine transaminase 78 U/L, aspartate transaminase 82 U/L and alkaline phosphatase 238 U/L. Routine urine examination was normal and culture revealed no growth after 72 h of incubation. Blood culture (two samples) was negative for bacteria. His sputum smear was negative for acid-fast bacilli for 3 consecutive days. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIV 1 and 2 was non-reactive. Mantoux test with 5 T.U. was negative. HBsAg and anti-HCV were negative. USG whole abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly. The patient's condition deteriorated further with appearance of right-sided pleural effusion [] and hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of pleural fluid showed cell count of 560/mm3 with 70% lymphocytes, protein 3.4 gm/dl, sugar 46 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 600 U/L and adenosine deaminase 36 U/L. The patient's contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of thorax showed organization of right middle lobe consolidation with enlargement of right paratracheal and subcarinal lymph nodes with central necrosis []. Fibre-optic bronchoscopy revealed pus coming from the right main bronchus and a gelatinous mass in the posterior wall of trachea and a widened carina with constricted right main bronchus []. Bronchoscopic biopsy from the mass showed inflammatory granulation tissue with proliferation of capillaries and infiltration of a large number of inflammatory cells. Gomori's methenamine silver stain showed fungal spores morphologically resembling Histoplasma capsulatum []. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) from subcarinal lymph node also showed the presence of capsulated round microorganism on a background of inflammatory exudates compatible with Histoplasma capsulatum. Post-bronchoscopic sputum for fungal culture showed a growth of Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient did not have any past history suggestive of exposure to Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B 50 mg/day for 1 week followed by oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily. Significant clinical improvement was noticed by 7 days and follow-up chest X-ray after one month showed a significant radiological resolution []. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

    "question": "A 60-year-old male came to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital, in Pakistan, with complaints of fever for one week, cough, and shortness of breath for two days. He was tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before admission. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test came positive and chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates as shown in Figure . The patient was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 infection and was admitted to our dedicated COVID-19 ICU. His past medical history included essential hypertension for the past 10 years, which was in control by his medication.\nExamination at the time of admissions showed a regular heart rate of 100 beats per minute, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) of 155/88 mmHg, temperature 37.5\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and pulse oximeter showed 80% saturation on room air. The patient was immediately given non-invasive 100% FiO2, which improved saturation to 95%. Continuous monitoring of vitals was done using the Life Scope VS BSM-3000 series monitor (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) for NIBP measurement, pulse oximetry, and electrocardiogram.\nInitial lab investigations showed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.9\u00d7109/L, elevated neutrophil percentage of 91%, decreased lymphocyte percentage of 6%, and a decreased platelet count of 95\u00d7109/L. The biochemical examination displayed normal serum creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase 1397 U/L. C-reactive protein (CRP) was markedly increased with a level of 82.5 mg/L, and procalcitonin was normal at 0.3 ng/mL. Coagulation function displayed an elevated D-dimer level of 1.96 mg/L, normal prothrombin time of 14.2 seconds, elevated international normalized ratio of 1.35, and elevated activated partial thromboplastin time of 28.4 seconds on Day 1. Arterial blood gases showed a slightly alkalotic pH of 7.48, decreased pCO2 of 27 mmHg, decreased pO2 of 60.7 mmHg, and increased lactate level of 3.2 mmol/L. His laboratory findings are shown in Table . However, one of the limitations to this study is that his complete cytokine assay was not performed.\nThe patient's treatment plan included antibiotics, prophylactic enoxaparin, 40 mg subcutaneous once daily, symptomatic, and supportive treatment, including steroids and vitamins. The patient was also found to have CRS by aggravated inflammatory markers, for example, CRP levels []. Intravenous TCZ 6 mg per kg was given on the day of admission. Oral feed along with oral and intravenous hydration was continued.\nOn the third day of admission, the patient's oxygen requirements decreased. The WBC count increased to 45\u00d7109/L, pO2 increased to 82 mmHg, and inflammatory markers were reduced. Chest X-ray also showed improvement. On the same day, the patient began complaining of pain in the right lower limb. A physical examination revealed hypothermia, numbness, and mild blackening of the right foot as shown in Figures , . Peripheral pulses of the right foot were not palpable. The vascular ultrasound of lower limbs showed no vascular flow in the popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis artery. A severe arterial insufficiency was diagnosed, and the Vascular Surgery department was consulted immediately. They declared the limb unsalvageable and counselled for right limb above-knee amputation after the patient's condition had stabilized. Administering a therapeutic anticoagulant dose to prevent any other athero-embolic event was also suggested. Enoxaparin was then increased to 80 mg subcutaneous twice daily. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were added for the raised white cell count. On the ninth day of admission, the patient was maintaining oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Chest X-ray showed a significant reduction in bilateral patchy infiltrates as shown in Figure . The right foot was blackened and atrophied, which extended up to the knee. No progression in ischemia was noted. The patient was stepped down to high dependency unit (HDU) and was placed on the vascular surgery operating room list for above-knee amputation. The surgery took place under spinal anesthesia. After all aseptic measures, fish-mouth incision was given at the mid femur level through the skin, superficial fascia, and subcutaneous tissue. Deep tissue dissection and muscle transection was done. Neurovascular structures were identified, ligated, and transected. Lastly, the bone was lacerated, hemostasis was secured, and the wound was closed. Aseptic pressure dressing was applied, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable. Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the HDU for 48 hours. The patient was then discharged and advised tablet rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily for one month.

    "question": "A 53-year-old male presented with cough, sputum, and headache for 2 weeks.\nFive years previously, he had been diagnosed with HIV. He noted the onset of cough, sputum, and headache. The cough worsened, his sputum turned more yellowish and headaches accompanied by neck stiffness were related to coughing.\nOver the first five years following the diagnosis of HIV, he was treated with antiretroviral medications (lamivudine and zidovudine; Combivir, Ritonavir; Norvir, atazanavir sulfate; Reyataz).\nVital signs were as follows: temperature, 38.0\u2103; blood pressure, 110/70 mm Hg; pulse rate, 90/min; respiratory rate, 20/min. He was alert mentally. Auscultation revealed rales in the right lower lung field. A Brudzinski-Kernig test was positive.\nComplete blood count results were white blood cell 18.43\u00d7103/\u00b5L (neutrophils 91.3%, lymphocytes 3.5%), hemoglobin 14.0 g/dL, hematocrit 40.3%, and platelets 290\u00d7103/\u00b5L. Serum chemistry showed blood urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL, creatinine 0.66 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 23 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.92 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 38.51 mg/dL. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) showed a white blood cell count of 108/\u00b5L, red blood cell count 0/\u00b5L, glucose 53 mg/dL, and protein 123 mg/dL. CSF and sputum bacterial cultures were negative. A CD4 T-cell count of 139/\u00b5L and HIV RNA of 20.7 copies/mL were recorded.\nPlain chest radiography showed ground glass opacity and consolidation in both lung fields (especially the right lower) (). Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography showed multiple irregular nodular infiltration in both lungs and patchy consolidation with ground glass opacity of the right middle and lower lung (). Contrast-enhanced cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a posterior epidural abscess: a peripheral rim-enhancing lesion at the posterior C2-3 epidural space (); osteomyelitis; mild scanning enhancement of the clivus and cervical spine; early leptomeningitis; and prominent leptomeningeal enhancement ().\nThe patient was administered vancomycin (1 g q 12 hr IV), ceftriaxone (2 g q 24 hr), clindamycin (600 mg q 12 hr) and fluconazole (400 mg q 24 hr). The patient's fever reduced 3 days following admission. His epidural abscess was discussed with the neurosurgeon in our hospital. There were no neurological symptoms, no surgical treatment was performed and antibiotic therapy was maintained. At follow-up 5 days after admission, a plain chest radiograph showed improvement, and S. pneumoniae was detected in two blood cultures that showed sensitivity to most antibiotics. The patient was thus switched from vancomycin plus ceftriaxone to ampicillin (2 g) plus sulbactam (1 g q 6 hr IV). Fifteen days after admission, neck stiffness had improved and cough and sputum production reduced. A plain chest X-ray showed decrease in both ground glass opacity and consolidation in both lung fields (). Twenty-six days after admission, laboratory analysis was as follows: white blood cell count 5.42\u00d7103/\u00b5L, neutrophils 55.9%, lymphocytes 25.9%, and C-reactive protein 0.26 mg/dL. The patient wished to be discharged, so antibiotic therapy was switched from intravenous to oral (amoxicillin/clavulanate 625 mg PO tid). Since discharge, no recurrence of symptoms or evidence of pneumonia according to plain chest radiography have been observed. One year after discharge, there is no abnormal finding on cervical MRI ().

    "question": "A 72-year-old female was referred to our hospital with unresolved dyspnea. She had a history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and cerebral infarction. Two weeks before admission, dyspnea and cough developed. She was admitted to the local hospital for 10 days and was on antibiotics, including a third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) and carbapenem (meropenem), resulting from suspected pneumonia.\nAt admission, she had resting dyspnea. Her body temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, heart rate 108 beats/min, blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 84% while receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 L/min. Physical examination was notable for crackles without wheezing in the lungs and pitting edema in both lower legs. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.33, PCO2 52 mmHg, PO2 56 mmHg, HCO3- 20.6 mM/L, and O2 saturation 84.6%. Laboratory tests revealed the following values: white blood cell count 8,840/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 11.2 g/\u00b5L, platelet count 393 K/\u00b5L, total bilirubin 0.17 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 20 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 14 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 97 IU/L (range, 30\u2013120 IU/L), gamma glutamyl transferase 46 IU/L (range, 5\u201339 IU/L), blood urea nitrogen 29.9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.69 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 27.57 mg/L (range, 0\u20135 mg/L), activated partial thrombin time 25.8 sec (range, 23\u201335 sec), and international normalized ratio 1.15. The level of brain natriuretic peptide and D-dimer were 1,921 pg/mL (range, 0\u2013150 pg/mL) and 5.8 \u03bcg/mL (range, 0\u20130.5 \u03bcg/mL), respectively; other laboratory results were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110 beats/min, T wave inversion in V1-4, poor R-wave progression, and rightward axis deviation, known as \u2018right ventricle (RV) strain.\u2019\nTransthoracic echocardiography (TTE) () showed RV dilatation with reduced systolic function, moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation (proximal isovelocity surface area radius, 5.1 mm; jet area, 7.5 cm2), left ventricle septal flattening during the systolic phase, inferior vena cava plethora, and moderate PH (pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP], 65.7 mmHg; mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 44 mmHg) without obvious atrial or ventricular septal defect. Left ventricular systolic function was preserved with an ejection fraction of 71%. Contrast\u2013enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) with pulmonary arteriography was performed. CT showed the presence of multiple small consolidative lesions in both lung fields without evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism. A pulmonary function test showed moderate obstructive lung defect with good response to bronchodilator (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] 78%, pre-FEV1 0.79 L, 43%\u2192post-FEV1 0.99 L, 58%). A 15% decrease in the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was noted.\nGiven these findings, right-sided heart failure originating from untreated asthma and acute decompensation caused by community-acquired pneumonia was suggested as the initial diagnosis. However, despite antibiotics and proper diuretic-based heart failure therapy, her dyspnea gradually worsened. On the 12th hospital day (HD), oxygen was supplied using a high flow nasal cannula (FiO2, 0.4; flow, 40 L/min), and oxygen saturation was maintained within the range of 90%\u201395%.\nOn the 14th HD, contrast-enhanced whole-body CT and ventilation/perfusion lung scans were performed to determine the cause of clinical deterioration. Chest CT showed numerous centrilobular nodules with \u201ctree-in-bud\u201d sign and pleural-enhancing nodules (). Abdominopelvic CT showed a 3-cm less enhancing mass with ill-defined margins located at the pancreatic head and neck region, in addition to upstream pancreatic duct dilatation (). A ventilation lung scan showed no significant decreased activity while a perfusion lung scan revealed multifocal peripherally distributed small perfusion defects in the bilateral lung fields (). Moreover, serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was elevated 77.9 U/mL (range, 0\u201335 U/mL); therefore, an endoscopic ultrasonographic-guided biopsy was needed for histopathological confirmation of pancreatic cancer. However, it was impossible to obtain the biopsy due to the unbearable severe dyspnea and opposition of the patient\u2019s family. 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography integrated with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was performed for diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer after discussion with the Pancreatobiliary Department (). This test showed an intensive hypermetabolic mass at the pancreatic head and neck portion with multiple common hepatic, portocaval, aortocaval, hepatoduodenal, para-aortic, left common iliac, mediastinum, right lower paratracheal, and right interlobar lymph node metastases in addition to numerous tiny bilateral lung and both pleural metastases.\nAccording to these clinical and radiologic findings, PTTM secondary to advanced pancreatic cancer was suggested as the final diagnosis. The clinical stage was TxN2M1, stage IV according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system []. Since the disease continuously progressed to multi-organ failure, including respiratory failure and acute kidney injury, only supportive care could be provided, and the patient died on the 27th day after diagnosis.

    "question": "Our patient is a 43-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented to our emergency room with a chief complaint of shortness of breath for the duration of 2 weeks. Two weeks before presentation, the patient was prescribed azithromycin by his primary care provider for a presumed diagnosis of pneumonia. On further history, the patient endorsed a non-productive cough associated with subjective fevers, chills, weakness and malaise for 1 month. He denied any past medical history of autoimmune, systemic or immune-compromising conditions. He denied any sick contacts, recent travel, tuberculosis or chemical exposure. He denied any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscular weakness or neurological symptoms, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. At baseline, he was able to walk approximately five blocks without getting dyspneic. He had no known drug allergies, took no other medications and his social history was negative other than 20 pack year smoking history. His family history was unremarkable as well. Our patient worked a desk job and his occupational history was negative for any kind of environmental pollutants known to be associated with lung disease. On admission to the emergency room, the patient was afebrile, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, heart rate of 115 beats/min, with a room air saturation of 75% and blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg. Physical exam was pertinent for hyperkeratosis over the index fingers and his thumbs bilaterally along with thickening noticed over the metacarpophalangeal joints and proximal interphalangeal joints. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. Early resuscitation was initiated and the patient was treated with 6 L of oxygen via nasal cannula and given 30 cc/kg of normal saline for fluid resuscitation with normalization of his blood pressure and heart rate prior to admission to the general medical telemetry unit.\nOn admission, his labs were remarkable for a white blood cell count of 25,000 units/L, hemoglobin level was 13.5 g/dL and platelet count of 385 \u00d7 109/L. On his metabolic panel, the patient\u2019s sodium level was 133 mg/dL with a BUN of 13 mg/dL and creatinine of 0.69 mg/dL, with troponin being 0.09 \u03bcg/L and B-type natriuretic peptide being 79 pg/mL. His liver function was remarkable for a normal alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin level with aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase of 259 units/L and 266 units/L, respectively with a CPK of 7,500 International Units/L. Albumin was measured at 2.4 g/dL with a globulin level of 4.2 g/dL. His arterial blood gas values were remarkable at 7.37/43/52 on 6 L nasal cannula oxygen. His lactic acid was elevated at 2.4 mg/dL. ESR on admission was 35 mm/h, CRP was 24 mg/L and procalcitonin level was 34 ng/mL. ANA showed a speckled patter with 1:320 titers, anti-Jo-1 antibody was also positive at 8 and anti-CCP antibody was positive at 153.\nA CT scan of his chest on admission () showed a pericardial effusion measuring 1.3 cm in thickness. Non-confluent areas of ill defined opacities were also seen in both lungs with denser consolidations and air Broncho-grams mainly in the right middle lobe and both the lower lobes which were thought to be a combination of infiltrates and atelectasis. A chest X-ray () showed a small right-sided pleural effusion with a patchy right sided opacity. An echocardiogram (ECHO) evaluation revealed a moderate to large pericardial effusion (). A chest X-ray at the end of the course of treatment showed complete resolution of the prior findings ().\nThe patient required intensive care unit transfer 2 days into admission for worsening hypoxia and hypotension initially treated with 24 h of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and subsequent mechanical ventilation. Despite maximal ventilator support and pulmonary artery catheterization for optimal fluid management, the patient continued to decline. A decision to pursue veno-venous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was undertaken for a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome 4 days into admission.\nOwing to the radiographic and clinical findings suspicious for acute interstitial pneumonia and diagnostically negative bronchoscopic, viral, fungal, bacterial and mycobacterial serology, the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, namely, vancomycin, zosyn and azithromycin. The radiographic appearance, serologic findings combined with physical exam findings like \u201cmechanic\u2019s hands\u201d, non-specific interstitial pneumonia with a pattern of ILD with elevated CK and positive anti-Jo-1, heightened the suspicion of a rare form of acutely progressing AS. Hence, the decision was made to treat the patient with high dose methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days, followed by 125 mg, four times a day for 4 days, followed by a taper of 60 mg, four times a day for 4 days. The steroid medication was further weaned down to prednisone 40 mg daily, a dosage which he was discharged on.\nWith regard to his cardiovascular status, the patient had minimal vasopressor requirements despite his initial shock physiology. Follow-up serial echocardiography noted worsening pericardial effusion, necessitating the need for both diagnostic and therapeutic pericardial window. Fluid analysis showed no signs of infection with discharge surveillance ECHO showing no re-accumulation of pericardial fluid.\nThe patient developed non-oliguric renal failure thought to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis from a combination of hypotension and sepsis. The patient did not require renal replacement therapy however. Rhabdomyolysis was not felt to contribute to renal failure with CPKs peaking at 7,500 International Units/L followed by a gradual fall.\nThe course was also complicated by an upper gastrointestinal bleed which endoscopically was attributed to erosive gastritis managed conservatively via proton pump inhibitors.\nOver the course of his stay, the patient showed significant improvement in his respiratory, cardiovascular and renal status and was decannulated from ECMO in 2 days (yes sure it was 2 days) with transition to mechanical ventilation. The patient was extubated shortly afterwards and had significantly improved clinical dyspnea. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

    "question": "A 63-year-old Korean woman with a past medical history of hypertension and a 25-year history of SLE presented with a 3-week history of shortness of breath. She had been treated with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day and varying doses of prednisone between 5 and 15 mg/day for the SLE. Additionally, the hypertension was under control with carvedilol 25 mg/day. On examination, her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 112 beats/min, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, and body temperature was 36.5\u2103. Jugular venous distention was noted on inspection. On cardiac auscultation, her rhythm was noted to be tachycardic but regular, weak summation gallops were heard at the cardiac apex, and no pericardial friction rubs were appreciated. Blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 4000/mm3 (normal, 4300-9400/mm3), hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL (normal, 12-14.3 g/dL) and platelet count of 67000/mm3 (normal, 169-365/mm3). The C-reactive protein level was found to be 0.29 mg/L (normal, 0-0.75 mg/L). A blood chemistry panel revealed a blood urea nitrogen level of 25.0 mg/dL (normal, 7-20 mg/dL), creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL (normal, 0.5-1.5 mg/dL), total protein of 6.7 g/dL (normal, 6.0-8.3 gm/dL), and albumin of 3.2 g/dL (normal, 3.5-4.5 mg/dL). Analysis of the urinary sediment revealed 1-4 white blood cells/high power field (hpf), many red blood cells/hpf, and trace levels of proteinuria. Cardiac enzymelabs were drawn and found to be elevated: CK-MB of 8.7 U/L (normal, 0.6-6.3 U/L), troponin-I of 0.35 ng/mL (normal, 0.0-0.2 ng/mL), and pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 8110 pg/mL (normal, 0-125 pg/mL). Chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and an electrocardiogram revealed ST elevation in leads V1-6 (). Immunofluorescence tests were negative for double-stranded DNA antibodies and anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (anti-Ro and anti-La). Complement levels were found to be low (C3 0.39 g/L, normal 0.8-1.7 g/L; C4 0.04 g/L, normal 0.12-0.36 g/L). Viral markers for cytomegalovirus, Coxsackie virus B type 2, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus were all negative. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 42%] with apical akinesia but no evidence of pericardial effusion (). Echocardiography performed 2 years earlier showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a LVEF of 70%. A coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries.\nWe suspected takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However there was no trigger event as physical and emotional stress. The patient was treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, furosemide, and intravenous nitrates. The dose of glucocorticoids was between 0.5 to 1 mg/kg for the control of SLE activity. Her dyspnea gradually improved, however, a three-week follow-up echocardiography test revealed persistent apical ballooning and a newly developed apical thrombus (size, 1.10 \u00d7 2.12 cm) () with no significant improvement in LVEF. Heparin was then administered followed by oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. There were no embolic events during the patient's hospital stay. On the 35th day of hospital admission, follow-up echocardiography showed slightly improved wall motion of the left ventricular apex with a partially resolved thrombus and a LVEF of 50%. Although cardiac enzymes remained elevated (CK-MB 12.80 U/L and troponin-I 0.64 ng/mL), the patient was discharged on oral anticoagulation therapy.\nThree months later, she was readmitted to the hospital due to a severe herpes zoster outbreak on her left shoulder. Cardiac enzymes were again found to be elevated (CK-MB 8.8 U/L and troponin-I 0.98 ng/mL). Electrocardiography revealed persistent ST segment elevation () and echocardiography revealed mild apical hypokinesia with a LVEF 50%, but no apical thrombus (). During her hospital stay she developed a mild fever and candidemia which was treated with an intravenous antifungal agent. Unfortunately, she developed septic shock and expired on day 54 of hospital re-admission. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of a 3-day history of shortness of breath and dry cough. He had no known significant co-morbidities and did not report any further associated symptoms. He reported that he was treated with antibiotics for a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) by a private physician in the previous 3 days with no improvement in symptoms. He was unsure of his HIV status and was not on antiretroviral therapy (ART).\nHis admission vitals were a blood pressure of 123/70 (82) mmHg, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and a temperature of 36.9 \u00b0C. On examination, he had no significant lymphadenopathy and was not found to have mucosal or skin lesions associated with advanced HIV. No other obvious stigmata of advanced HIV were noted. He was in severe respiratory distress with scattered bilateral predominantly basal crackles on auscultation. Wheezing was not present on auscultation. He had an oxygen saturation of 62% on a partial rebreather mask with an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 80%.\nLaboratory investigations revealed a white cell count (WCC) of 14.5 \u00d7 109 cells/L, haemoglobin (Hb) of 11.6 g/L, platelets of 298 \u00d7 109 cells/L, urea of 6.3 mmol/L, creatinine of 108 \u03bcmol/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 102 mg/L and beta-d-glucan (BDG) of > 500 pg/mL. His admission blood gas showed a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with type II respiratory failure and a markedly increased alveolar-arterial gradient (pH = 7.36, pCO2 = 34.7, pO2 = 64.8, HCO3 = 19.2, BE = -4.9, SpO2 = 96.9, Hb = 13.4, Lac = 4.4). His chest X-ray (CXR) showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates and granular opacities. A transthoracic echocardiogram performed at the time of admission showed normal left ventricular function, no evidence of pulmonary embolus and normal heart valves. Based on clinical suspicion, hypoxaemic respiratory failure with typical chest radiograph changes, the patient\u2019s normal echocardiogram, elevated BDG, and the relative absence of clinical signs usually associated with a multilobar pneumonia, the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was considered.\nOn the basis of his clinical condition and investigations, the patient was intubated, ventilated and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory support. He was empirically started on treatment for partially treated community acquired pneumonia (CAP) (piperacillin and tazobactam and a macrolide) as well as PCP, on the basis of clinical case definition as suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO), with high-dose intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (hydrocortisone). He consented to HIV testing on admission and was found to be HIV-infected with a CD4 count of 7 cells/\u03bcL. Additional sputum and blood investigations for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) including TB culture (sputum and blood) and Auramine O stain, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (TB GeneXpert), sputum gram stain and bacterial culture and direct fluorescence antigen test for PCP were negative. Standard aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures yielded no pathogenic organisms.\nThe patient was intubated and ventilated for 3 days and spent a week in our unit. During this period, we adopted a lung protective ventilation strategy, permissive hypoxaemia as well as meticulous fluid management. Through his week-long admission, he had a cumulative fluid balance of -332 mL. Initial pre-admission ventilator settings of FiO2 = 1, PEEP = 14 and \u0394P = 8 were successfully weaned to FiO2 = 0.6, PEEP = 10 and \u0394P = 10 on day one of admission. We accepted oxygen saturations in the region of 70%\u201380% and PaO2 measurements in the region of 50 mmHg \u2013 60 mmHg whilst maintaining tidal volumes of 4 mL/kg \u2013 6 mL/kg. On day four of admission, despite oxygen saturations in the region of 80%, the patient was successfully extubated and placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIV). He required NIV (positive end expiratory pressure of 6 cm H2O and pressure support of 6 cm H2O) for a total of 3 days before being weaned onto oxygen supplementation with an FiO2 of 0.4. He maintained oxygen saturations in the region of 85%\u201390%. He was discharged to the ward on nasal cannula after a 7-day ICU stay. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

    "question": "The patient was a 73-year-old man. He received docetaxel and prednisolone chemotherapy for prostate cancer and was administered pegfilgrastim after chemotherapy. His medication history included oral administration of rivaroxaban. Eight days before the onset of fatigue, he was traveling during chemotherapy and had been in a hot tub. Subsequently, he visited the hospital because he continued to experience fatigue over the next 5 days. The patient's physical findings were as follows: alert and oriented, fever (39.0 \u00b0C), dyspnea (oxygen saturation [SpO2] 90% with no oxygen; respiratory rate, 17 breaths/min), no hemoptysis, and no chest pain. The patient\u2019s blood pressure was normal (111/81 mmHg); however, tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (132 beats/min) were present. The A-DROP score for assessing the severity of community-acquired pneumonia by the Japanese Respiratory Society was 3 points (age \u2265 70 years in men, dehydration, or blood urea nitrogen \u2265 21 mg/dL, SpO2 \u2264 90%). The patient was admitted to the hospital for severe pneumonia. On admission, the patient\u2019s white blood cell count was 700/\u03bcL; serum sodium, 133 mEq/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 28 mg/dL; serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration, 335 U/L; urea nitrogen, 22.4 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 1.23 mg/dL; and D-dimer level, 1.8 \u03bcg/mL. Chest CT revealed an infiltrative shadow and pleural effusion in the upper and lower left lobes (Fig. ) but did not show the appearance of a typical COVID-19 radiological pattern including ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in both inferior lobes.\nThe urine Legionella antigen test by immunochromatography and SARS-CoV-2 test by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of swabs from the nasal cavity were positive. The patient was immediately administered levofloxacin, tazobactam/piperacillin, vancomycin, remdesivir, ciclesonide, nafamostat mesilate, and dexamethasone. On day 2 of hospitalization, the patient\u2019s dyspnea worsened, his respiratory rate increased to 30 breaths/min, and chest radiograph revealed worsening pneumonia. Therefore, tracheal intubation was performed. The partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (P/F ratio) after intubation was 160, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Subsequently, the patient was provided with analgesia, sedation, and hemodynamic maintenance. After tracheal intubation, respiratory management, including a tidal volume of \u2264 6 mL/kg/ideal body weight, control of plateau pressure, and high positive end-expiratory pressure were provided according to the lung protection strategy of ARDS. One day after intubation, his P/F ratio improved to 390, but 2 days after intubation, his P/F ratio worsened to 220, so prone position therapy was started. On day 6 of hospitalization, his serum creatinine increased to 3.22 mg/dL, and continuous hemodiafiltration was started. On day 8 of hospitalization, his P/F ratio improved to 361, and he was extubated. His general condition also improved, and his serum creatinine decreased to 2.3 mg/dL. The electrolyte imbalance was not recognized, so the continuous hemodiafiltration was discontinued. He was moved to the general ward on the 14th day of hospitalization. On the day 20, oxygen administration was no longer necessary, and the patient was discharged on the 27th day of hospitalization (Fig. ). What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

    "question": "A 15-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with a 1-week history of fever as well as dry cough, dyspnea, and myalgia that started on the day of admission. She had been healthy prior to admission and had no notable history of respiratory or allergic disease. In her family history, her father was being treated for liver cirrhosis. She had started smoking 3-5 cigarettes daily 3 weeks before admission, but stopped smoking 1 week before admission due to discomfort after smoking. On admission, the patient had clear consciousness but appeared acutely ill. Her blood pressure was 112/70 mmHg, pulse rate 121/minute, respiratory rate 24/minute, and body temperature 36.4\u2103. The conjunctivae were pink, and the sclerae showed no sign of jaundice. No cervical lymph nodes were palpable. On physical examination, rales and coarse breathing sounds were audible, but heart sounds were normal. There were no abnormal findings in the abdomen.\nOn admission, routine blood tests revealed white blood cells, 19,400/\u00b5L; hemoglobin, 14.4 g/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 17 mm/hour; platelets, 241,000/\u00b5L; neutrophils, 90.8%; lymphocytes, 3.7%; monocytes, 4.0%; and eosinophils, 1.4%. Arterial blood gas analysis performed in room air exhibited pH 7.45; PaCO2, 31 mmHg; PaO2, 64 mmHg; HCO3, 22.0 mEq/L; base excess, -1.4 mEq/L; and oxygen saturation, 93%. Blood biochemical tests showed total protein, 5.9 g/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 17 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 8 IU/L; C-reactive protein, 4.22 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 1.1 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 4.0 mg/dL; and creatinine, 0.4 mEq/L. Chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates, especially in the peripheral region () and chest CT exhibited multiple nodular lesions with ground-glass appearance (). The patient was negative for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antibody against Mycoplasma, and cold agglutinin. The levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and C4 were within the normal limits, and the total IgE level was 113 KU/L. Cultures of blood and sputum were negative for bacteria and fungi. Urine tests were negative for antigens of Legionella and Pneumococcus, and IgG tests against parasites were negative for Paragonimus westermani and Clonorchis sinesis. Stool examination was negative for parasite ova. Immediately after admission, ampicillin/sulbactam and cefotaxime, as well as oseltamivir, were administered under the suspicion of pandemic H1N1 infection, but hypoxia, dyspnea, and pneumonic infiltration on chest X-ray were aggravated abruptly. Non-invasive ventilation was maintained. On the second day in hospital, bronchoscopy revealed no abnormal findings, but BALF tests exhibited white blood cells, 280/\u00b5L; macrophages, 19%; neutrophils, 10%; lymphocytes, 26% eosinophils, 35% (eosinophilia); and basophils, 4% (). BALF cultures were negative for bacteria and fungi. The patient was negative for PCR and culture of viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus; real-time RT-PCR for the novel influenza virus H1N1; antigen tests for Aspergillus and Pneumocystis jiroveci; PCR and culture of cytomegalovirus and Chlamydia pneumonia; PCR of Epstein-Barr virus; and acid-fast bacillus smear. On the third day in hospital, thoracoscopy-assisted lung biopsy was performed in the middle and lower lobes of the left lung, which showed eosinophilic infiltrates suggestive of interstitial pneumonia (). Based on these results, the patient was diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. On the fifth day in hospital, urine cotinine level, which was determined to confirm smoking, was 47 ng/mL. Furthermore, routine blood test revealed white blood cells, 5,500/\u00b5L; neutrophils, 45.8%; lymphocytes, 26.0%; monocytes, 9.0%; and eosinophils (19.0%, eosinophilia). Methylprednisolone (125 mg) was administered every 6 hours. The day after methylprednisolone administration, hypoxia and dyspnea improved, and infiltrates on chest X-ray improved 2 days after drug administration (). Methylprednisolone was tapered from the fourth day of drug administration. The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 9 and was followed up periodically. At the time of discharge from the hospital, routine blood tests revealed white blood cells, 10,300/\u00b5L; neutrophils, 59.6%; lymphocytes, 31.5%; monocytes, 6.3%; and eosinophils, 2.4% (within the normal limits). There were no specific findings in pulmonary function, methacholine provocation, and skin prick tests. Methylprednisolone is being tapered at the outpatient clinic. On day 15 of follow-up, chest X-ray showed no infiltrates. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

    "question": "A 74-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suffered cervicalgia and a stiff shoulder after engaging in farm work. He was a chicken farmer and produced a fertilizer that utilized cow and poultry manure. He went to a nearby clinic 2 days after the onset of symptoms as he experienced difficulty swallowing. Tetanus was strongly suspected from his clinical condition, and he was transferred to the emergency room 3 days after the initial symptoms began. His vital signs were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale score, 15 (E4V5M6); blood pressure, 144/63 mmHg; heart rate, 79 b.p.m.; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; and body temperature, 36.5\u00b0C. The level of oxygen saturation showed 96%. Painful contracture of the neck was observed. Trismus, risus sardonicus, and strong muscle spasms in the platysma and sternocleidomastoideus were observed (Fig. ). Laboratory tests revealed slight inflammation and rhabdomyolysis (white blood cell count, 12,600 cells/mm3; C-reactive protein, 0.04 mg/dL; lactase dehydrogenase, 276 U/L; creatine kinase, 340 IU/L; blood urea nitrogen, 25.5 mg/dL). A computed tomography scan showed emphysematous bulla in the lung and patchy pneumonia in the right upper lobe. Tetanus was clinically diagnosed and he was admitted into the intensive care unit (Fig. ). Polyethylene glycol-treated human anti-tetanus immunoglobulin (3,000 units) was injected and benzylpenicillin potassium (8,000,000 units/day) was administered. Both KT (7.5 g/day) and SKT (7.5 g/day) were given by nasogastric tube to release muscle tension. One to three packages of each Kampo extract was dissolved in tap water (20 mL). Trismus and generalized convulsions were temporarily improved 30 min after treatment with KT and SKT (Fig. B). Fluctuation of systolic blood pressure (100\u2013170 mmHg) was observed for the first 3 days of hospitalization. It was most severe on day 1 (70\u2013180 mmHg). On day 3 of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation was introduced to treat the complications of pneumonia. Blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.47, PaO2 87 mmHg, PaCO2 41 mmHg, base excess (BE) 5.6 mEq/L (FIO2 0.6, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilaton (SIMV) 13/min, pressure control (PC) 10 cmH2O, pressure support (PS) 8 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 4 cmH2O). After 11 days of hospitalization, doses of KT and SKT were reduced to 5.0 g/day, as the tetanic convulsions were controlled without the use of muscle relaxants. After 17 days of hospitalization, the patient was weaned from the ventilator. The patient was discharged from the intensive care unit after 25 days; after 27 days, treatment with all Kampo medicines was terminated. After 30 days of hospitalization, he was discharged from the hospital without sequelae.\nThe blood culture at the time of the patient's admission showed negative results; however, on day 4 of hospitalization, Klebsiella oxytoca was detected from the sputum culture.

    "question": "A 78-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with chief complaints of fever with productive cough since last ten days and altered sensorium with chest pain for one day. The patient was apparently well ten days back when he developed high grade fever and cough with haemoptysis and yellowish sputum. It was also associated with shortness of breath. He was a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus with uncontrolled sugar. There was no past history of taking antitubercular drugs and no exposure to pets. On examination, he was febrile; heart rate was 122 beats/min, respiratory rate was 28/min; blood pressure was 122/75 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation was 84% while breathing room air. The patient had bilateral pedal oedema. Respiratory system examination revealed bilateral crepitation with occasional rhonchi. The total leucocyte count was 14000/mm3 with 95% neutrophils and 3% lymphocytes. The haemoglobin was 11.67 g/dl, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 110/h. Serum urea was 43 mg, and creatinine was 0.7 mg/dl. On chest radiography, there were bilateral fluffy opacities. Inj Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV BD was started empirically along with Inj Azithromycin 500 mg BD along with other supportive treatment. On the same day, as the patient was rapidly desaturating, he was shifted to the respiratory ICU where he was intubated and kept on ventilator. Neurologist opinion was taken for the altered sensorium and a normal contrast CT scan of the head was done. Sputum sample was collected which came out negative for AFB but surprisingly KOH mount revealed weak, acid-fast, and filamentous bacilli resembling Nocardia spp. On day 4, the empirical regimen was stopped, and the patient was started on Inj Imipenem and Inj Amikacin. However, the patient developed hypotension with tachycardia, as a result of which IV fluids and inotropic support was given. Despite this on day 8, he had severe bradycardia with profound hypotension. CPR was started with repeated cycles and DC shock, but the patient could not be revived and was declared dead.

    "question": "A 76-year-old female who had never smoked came to the hospital because of chronic cough. The chest radiograph showed bilateral consolidation with a cavity (Figure ). The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple consolidations in both lungs with cavities in the left upper lobe (Figure ). The acid-fast stain of the sputum smear was positive, and the sputum culture and the PCR were also positive for M. tuberculosis. Thus, the patient was diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis, and she was admitted to hospital for treatment. Three days later from admission to prior hospital, the patient developed acute abdominal pain with guarding. An abdominal radiograph showed marked dilatation of the small intestine (Figure ). On enhanced abdominal CT (Figure ), intestinal obstruction caused by a mass lesion with a target sign in the ascending colon was seen. A concentric ring of intraluminal mesenteric fat interposed between the central portion and the outer edematous colonic wall gives this lesion its characteristic appearance. In addition, the small intestine was enlarged and filled with fluid. The patient was diagnosed as having intussusception and was admitted to our hospital to treat both the pulmonary tuberculosis and the intussusception. On physical examination, her body temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the heart rate was 86 beats/min, and the respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min. Her blood pressure was 150/72 mmHg. Coarse crackles were audible in the left lung. The patient had no peripheral lymphadenopathy, no skin lesions, and no neurological deficits. On abdominal examination, the mass lesion was palpable in the right lower abdominal region, and guarding was present. On laboratory examination, the white blood cell count was elevated (15.4 \u00d7 103/mm3), the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was increased (5.43 mg/dl), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was increased (70 mm/h). Other laboratory results included: total protein, 5.9 g/dl; serum albumin, 3.4 g/dl; serum creatinine, 0.5 mg/dl; blood urea nitrogen, 14.0 mg/dl; and serum lactate dehydrogenase, 301 IU/l. The serum glucose concentration and liver function tests were normal, and the serum complement prothrombin time was 97%. The HIV antibody was negative and the numbet of CD4 positive T-lymphocyte was normal. Arterial blood gases were improved on 2L O2 given nasally (PaO2, 80.1 Torr; PaCO2, 52.1 Torr; pH, 7.46; HCO3, 36.5 mmol/L; BE 11.3 mmol/L). Abdominal ultrasonography showed the bull's eye sign at the site of the mass lesion (Figure ). Since there was a possibility of intestinal necrosis, ileocecal resection was done on the day of admission. Macroscopically, it could be seen that the terminal ileum gained entry to the ascending colon. Pathologically, there were large areas of ischemic enteritis due to intussusceptions, and caseous necrosis with epithelioid cell granulomas was seen (Figure ). There was no evidence of any neoplasm or diverticulum that could have caused the intussusception. Thus, this patient was diagnosed as having intussusception due to intestinal tuberculosis. The patient was treated with isoniazid (300 mg/day), rifampicin (600 mg/day), ethambutol (750 mg/day), and pyrazinamide (750 mg/day). The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and there has been no recurrence. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

He smoked 5 cigarettes per day for over 20 years but denied using alcohol or recreational drugs.\nOn physical examination, the patient was in respiratory distress, with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and pulse oxygen saturation of 90% on 2 liters per minute oxygen via a nasal cannula. His temperature was 101.5\u00b0F, heart rate was 68 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 80/50 mm\u00b7Hg. On lung examination, bilateral rales were noted. His heart sounds were normal. His abdomen was soft upon palpation, with slight tenderness in the right upper quadrant; no organomegaly was noted. Neurologic examination was unremarkable. The patient was intubated immediately because of his respiratory distress, and an intravenous infusion of norepinephrine was begun for the presumptive diagnosis of septic shock.\nRelevant laboratory results on the day of admission were as follows: leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 20 \u00d7 103 cells/\u00b5L), lactic acidosis (serum lactate: 17.5 mmol/L), pH of 7.15, bicarbonate of 15 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 37 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 4.5 mg/dL, and increased serum aspartate transaminase (1532 unit/L), alanine aminotransferase (683 unit/L), and alkaline phosphatase (149 unit/L). Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates ().\nThe patient underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage; diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was excluded, and cultures from the lavage samples were negative. Bedside ultrasound of the abdomen revealed acalculous acute cholecystitis, and a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed. Blood cultures from admission grew P. multocida, and gram-negative Pasteurella rods were seen on gram stain during examination via light microscopy. Cultures from the gallbladder fluid were negative. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74% and no vegetations.\nThe patient was diagnosed with multiorgan failure, septic shock with severe lactic acidosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were begun. His condition rapidly deteriorated, and his clinical course was further complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation, gastrointestinal bleeding, and refractory shock requiring multiple vasopressor medications. He subsequently died of a cardiopulmonary arrest. Despite all measures, the serum lactic acid at the time of his death was 12 mmol/L. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old Iranian woman, recipient of a living, unrelated renal transplant five years earlier, presented with a productive cough, weight loss and fever. The cause of her end-stage renal disease was chronic pyelonephritis. Six weeks prior to her admission, her immunosuppressant regimen was switched from oral cyclosporine (100 mg, twice daily) to oral sirolimus (1 mg, twice daily) with a diagnosis of chronic allograft nephropathy (serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dL). Her mycophenolate mofetil dose was decreased from 2000 to 1000 mg/day and prednisolone was continued with the previous dose (5 mg, daily). Four weeks later, she developed a mild cough, weakness and anorexia. Her condition progressed to a more constant cough and weight loss until she was hospitalized.\nPhysical examination revealed her blood pressure to be 110/60 mm/Hg, respiratory rate 20/min, pulse rate 92/min and body temperature 38\u00b0C. A chest examination revealed fine crackles mainly on her lower lung fields. On admission, the laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 5.1 \u00d7 109/L, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit 22.4%, mean corpuscular volume 75 fL (normal range, 77-97 fL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin 24 pgm (normal range, 26-32 pgm), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 32% (normal, 32-36%), platelet count 213 \u00d7 109/L, fasting blood glucose 105 mg/dL, blood urea 62 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase 37 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 45 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 1106 IU/L and total bilirubin 1 mg/dL. A urine analysis was unremarkable.\nOn the first day of admission, sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were discontinued and cyclosporine (200 mg/day) was started. The dose of prednisolone was not altered (5 mg, daily). A chest X-ray showed fine miliary nodules throughout the entire lung fields. Echocardiography revealed normal pericardium and cardiac chambers. Her left ventricular ejection fraction was 65%. An ultrasound examination of her renal allograft did not reveal any pathologic finding. A 6 mm induration was observed on a TB skin test. Sputum and bronchial aspirate examination was positive for acid-fast bacilli, suggestive of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan illustrated widespread miliary nodules throughout the lung fields, compatible with miliary TB (Figure ).\nIn the evening of her fourth day of admission, our patient developed an increasing right lower quadrant abdominal pain spreading to her entire abdomen. Physical examination revealed widespread abdominal tenderness and rebound. An ultrasonographic study of her abdomen disclosed a small fluid collection in the right lower quadrant. Two cysts were detected in her left ovary (54 \u00d7 32 mm and 33 \u00d7 31 mm). An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast revealed that her pancreas and spleen were normal. Her colonic wall thickness was measured as 4 mm and free fluid was visible in dependent parts of her abdominal cavity. Her peritoneal cavity was then opened with a midline incision and widespread peritonitis was found. Her inflamed appendix (9 \u00d7 6 cm) was perforated at its tip. Her ileocecal area and cecum were inflamed with fragile tissues. A cecostomy was performed and a drain was placed. Histopathological examination of the resected appendix revealed caseating epithelioid granulomas, epithelioid histiocytes and Langhans giant cells in the sub-mucosa and sub-serosa of her appendix (Figure ). The histological picture, along with positive mycobacterial cultures from the sputum and bronchial aspirate, was suggestive of tuberculous appendicitis. After surgery, chemotherapy for TB was started and continued for nine months. An immunosuppressive regimen was continued with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. During follow-up visits, the pulmonary and abdominal signs and symptoms were resolved. What is the patient's CURB-65 score?",

    "question": "A 73-year-old female was brought by emergency medical services (EMS) to the emergency department (ED) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). She was driving when her car crashed into a streetlamp at 40 miles per hour. The EMS team reported that the pole intruded into the passenger compartment and the patient required a prolonged extrication. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 11 when EMS arrived at the scene, which improved to a 15 after repeated evaluations. She was conscious, alert, and oriented at the scene and during transport.\nThe patient had difficulty recalling the events before the collision. She remembered feeling \u201clike I was having a panic attack\u201d just before the crash, and she did not recall the car impacting the streetlamp. In the ED, she complained of substernal chest pressure. The patient\u2019s history was limited due to her continued difficulty recalling the events of the accident. The patient\u2019s son was contacted and he stated that she lives alone and is active and independent. He stated that she had experienced syncopal episodes over the last several years, all associated with paroxysms of panic when driving, and she had undergone extensive workups without any clear etiology identified. She had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast four years prior for stroke-like symptoms after a syncopal event. Per his report, no abnormalities were found.\nThe patient had a past medical history of anxiety, migraines, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, which was treated with a left mastectomy followed by five years of tamoxifen and letrozole treatment. She had a family history of dementia, diabetes, and heart disease. She denied using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substances. She was prescribed, and was taking, the following medications: levothyroxine 25 micrograms daily; atorvastatin 20 milligrams (mg) nightly; rizatriptan 10 mg as needed for headaches; and multivitamins.\nOn physical exam, the patient\u2019s temperature was 36.5\u00b0 Celsius, her heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 142/72 millimeters of mercury. She was breathing at a rate of 21 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She weighed 125 pounds and was 5 feet, 3 inches tall, with a body mass index of 22.1 kilograms per meter squared. She did not appear to be in any acute distress, was healthy appearing, and was oriented to her name, date, and location. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic; she had no Battle sign, raccoon eyes, or other signs of trauma. She had hearing aids in place bilaterally. She had normal extraocular movements with equal pupils that were reactive to light. She had a cervical collar in place. Later, when it was safe to remove her collar, her neck had a normal range of motion without rigidity or pain.\nOn auscultation, her heart had a regular S1 and S2 at a normal rate and was without murmurs. She had normal pulses bilaterally. Her lungs were clear without wheezing or rhonchi, and she was noted to have normal effort without respiratory distress. Her abdomen was soft and flat, without tenderness or guarding. Her musculoskeletal exam showed an overall normal range of motion without deformities. She had no step-offs of the spinous processes or tenderness along the midline spine. The remainder of her skeletal exam only revealed tenderness over the left wrist. She had a capillary refill of less than two seconds. On her skin exam, she had minor contusions to the left upper chest near the axilla with superficial abrasions along the left wrist. She was not diaphoretic. Neurologically she had no cranial nerve deficits, with no motor weakness or sensory deficits peripherally. She had a normal gait and normal coordination as well. She could not recall her birth date and had slow verbalization with some word-finding difficulty. Psychiatrically, she was normal in mood and behavior.\nPoint-of care-ultrasound did not find evidence of free fluid within the abdominal or thoracic cavities and was negative for a pericardial effusion. Point-of-care ultrasound examination of her chest revealed normal lung sliding bilaterally. Chest radiograph showed no acute abnormalities. A radiograph of her pelvis showed no fracture or malalignment of the bones. A computed tomography (CT) of her head and brain showed no intracranial injury. A CT of the cervical spine and chest with contrast in the arterial phase was performed, which showed normal vertebral body height and alignment without fracture. The CT did show some mild atherosclerosis of the carotid and vertebral arteries, but no vascular injury and no obvious narrowing. Her trachea and mainstem bronchi were patent, she had no mediastinal abnormalities, the thoracic aorta was normal in appearance, and she had no pericardial effusion or pneumothorax ().\nA CT of her abdomen and pelvis with contrast in the venous phase was also performed, which showed patent vasculature including a normal caliber aorta and inferior vena cava, normal appearing spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys/ureters, a small hiatal hernia but otherwise normal appearing bowel, and no ascites or pneumoperitoneum. The radiologist did not find any fractures on her imaging or any soft tissue injuries. Initial laboratory studies (), laboratory studies after administration of intravenous fluids (), and the patient\u2019s electrocardiograms (ECG) () are shown.

    "question": "A 66-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was brought to the ED for altered mental status. The patient\u2019s wife reported that two hours prior to arrival, he had ingested two glasses of wine and took a nap. Prior to napping the wife noted no unusual symptoms. Upon awaking, he was noted to have dysarthria and discoordination of his extremities and was brought to the ED. His wife reported that his home medications included bupropion, dutasteride, lisinopril, and tolterodine.\nHis vital signs were blood pressure 115/78 millimeters mercury, heart rate 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 36.8\u00b0 Celsius, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On exam, the patient was noted to have waxing and waning alertness, but he could intermittently answer questions and follow commands. His pupils were reactive, sluggish, and with horizontal and vertical nystagmus. His face was symmetric and his tongue was midline. His speech was dysarthric. He was unable to follow commands for strength testing, but he was moving all extremities without appreciable asymmetry. He had bilateral dysmetria on finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing. He had truncal ataxia in the seated position. His mental status and ataxia progressively worsened during his ED stay of approximately 1.5 hours.\nGiven the acute onset of symptoms, an institutional stroke alert was activated and a head computed tomography angiogram was obtained, which was negative for hemorrhage or other abnormality. Laboratory values, including complete blood count, chemistry panel, coagulation panel, and urinalysis were within normal limits. His blood alcohol level was 57 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a QRS of 108 ms and a QTc of 497 ms. A dose of naloxone 0.4 milligrams was trialed without improvement in patient\u2019s somnolence. He was evaluated by the neurology consultant team and determined to have a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 11. Given concern for a posterior circulation stroke, tissue plasminogen activator was administered for thrombolysis. The patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection due to increasing somnolence and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nWhile intubated in the ICU, the patient developed status epilepticus, characterized by three periods of generalized tonic clonic activity, each lasting approximately five minutes. He received multiple doses of benzodiazepine and phenytoin, in addition to the propofol infusion for sedation, resulting in cessation of seizure activity. Subsequent electroencephalogram did not demonstrate ongoing seizure activity, and the patient did not have an additional seizure during the hospital course while maintained on phenytoin.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not show evidence of acute stroke. Comprehensive urine drug screen by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was positive for clozapine and clozapine metabolites, in addition to caffeine and bupropion, a home medication. No drugs of abuse or other medications were detected. However, the patient had never been prescribed clozapine. In discussion with his wife, it was learned that the patient\u2019s family member takes clozapine for a psychiatric condition. The patient manages the family member\u2019s medication and they frequently take their respective medications at the same time. It was concluded that the patient must have mistaken the family member\u2019s medication for his and accidently ingested the family member\u2019s usual dose of 200 mg of clozapine, hours prior to his presentation. The patient was extubated on hospital day three and discharged with a normal neurologic exam and no further seizure activity on hospital day five.

    "question": "A 78-year-old female with a past medical history significant for breast cancer and moderate COPD presented to Emergency Department with syncope. Nine months prior to admission, she underwent left total mastectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma and was started on Tamoxifen 20 mg daily. Home medications included GB 50 mcg once daily, Salbutamol, calcium and a multi-vitamin. GB was started 3 months prior to her presentation for syncope.\nThe day prior to admission, she received an IV vitamin infusion consisting of a mixture of thiamine, folic acid, multivitamin and magnesium sulfate at a naturopath clinic. Shortly after completion of the IV infusion, she developed emesis and took 2 tablets of dimenhydrinate. The following day, she reported dizziness as she walked across the kitchen and passed out after sitting in a chair. The patient reported no palpitations, chest discomfort, nausea, warm sensation or diaphoresis prior to the syncope event. She was not witnessed to have any seizure like activity and when she regained consciousness, reported immediate awareness of surroundings with no neurological deficits, no tongue biting, bowel or urinary incontinence. There was no previous history of syncope and no family history of sudden cardiac death. Her initial blood pressure in the ambulance was 70/50 mm Hg. Hemodynamics normalized after administration of intravenous fluid and her symptoms resolved. Oxygen saturation was above 97 % and telemetry revealed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 77. Precordial examination was unremarkable with regular normal heart sounds and no murmurs. In the Emergency Department, blood tests including complete blood count (CBC), serum electrolytes (potassium, calcium, magnesium), glucose, creatinine and thyroid stimulating hormone were normal. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a corrected QT interval using Fridericia (QTcF) and Bazett\u2019s formula (QTcB) of 603 and 631 ms respectively (Fig. ) and she was admitted to the cardiology service for further investigation of the etiology for her QT prolongation.\nPrior to starting Tamoxifen her QTcF and QTcB were 439 and 440 ms respectively (Fig. ), however no ECG was obtained after initiation of Tamoxifen and prior to starting GB. Her last dose of Tamoxifen and GB were the day of admission with both medications discontinued at presentation.\nAn echocardiogram revealed that her left ventricular ejection fraction was >60 % with no valvular or regional wall motion abnormalities. Serial electrocardiograms demonstrated corrected QTcF and QTcB respectively of 603 and 631 ms day 0, 496 and 514 ms day 1, and 446 and 455 ms on day 2 and 442 and 460 ms on day 3 (Fig. ).

He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nasopharyngeal swab. His vital signs on examination were notable for a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and a temperature of 38.2\u00b0C. His chest X-ray was unremarkable. Given his clinical stability, further labwork was deferred and the patient was discharged from the ED to self-quarantine at home. Over the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient\u2019s symptoms completely resolved. He had repeat COVID-19 testing prior to returning to work, which was negative.\nTwo months after his negative COVID-19 testing, the patient developed progressive dyspnoea with minimal exertion. He had an episode of syncope which prompted him to return to the ED for further evaluation. On presentation, his blood pressure was 126/99 mmHg, heart rate 122 beats per minute, temperature 37.5\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Physical examination was notable for tachycardia with regular rhythm, 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border, positive jugular venous distention to 10 cm, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, and no evidence of lower extremity oedema.\nLabwork was significant for a troponin of 0.12 ng/mL (normal < 0.02 ng/mL), brain natriuretic peptide of 1321 pg/mL (normal < 100 pg/mL), lactate 2.5 mm/l (normal 0.9\u20131.7 mm/l), and a D-dimer of 19 014 ng/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) (normal < 100 ng/mL FEU). Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with an S1Q3T3 pattern (see ). Given the significantly elevated D-dimer and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a computed tomography angiogram with PE protocol was obtained that demonstrated acute bilateral PE described as a central obstructive clot with acute thrombus and a high obstructive score as defined by a modified Miller score of 15 (see ). Bedside echocardiography revealed severe right ventricular (RV) enlargement (6.5 cm) (), positive McConnell\u2019s sign, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (), right ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (RVOT VTI) of 6.69 cm (normal > 10 cm) (), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 10 mm (normal > 18 mm) (), and an right ventricular:left ventricular ratio of 2.4 (normal < 1) (). Repeat SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing returned positive, and the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit on a heparin infusion.\nAfter a multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response team discussion, it was recommended that the patient be escalated to catheter-directed thrombolysis given the multiple high-risk features for acute decompensation. Unfortunately, prior to the procedure the patient had an episode of bradycardia and hypoxia followed immediately by cardiopulmonary arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately initiated and full-dose systemic alteplase was administered. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for consideration of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Unfortunately, return of spontaneous circulation was unable to be achieved due to persistent PEA and asystole. What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?",

The patient had no history of cough, sputum, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. She had no history of tobacco smoking, tuberculosis or exposure to individuals with tuberculosis. She did not have a history of malignancy, diabetes mellitus, cytotoxic therapy or corticosteroid use. Her family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 90 beats/min, blood pressure of 157/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, temperature of 37.8 \u00b0C and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Respiratory, cardiac and abdominal examination were unremarkable. Chest radiograph showed multiple small nodules in both lung fields and chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse micronodules in random patterns in both lung lobes, cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusion (Figs. and ). White blood cell count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were 2800 /\u03bcl, 7.50 mg/dl (normal range 0.00\u20130.10 mg/dl) and 0.373 ng/ml (normal range 0.000\u20130.046 ng/ml), respectively.

Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Expectorated sputum smears were negative for bacteria and acid-fast bacilli. Urinary antigen testing (Binax NOW; Binax, Inc., Portland, ME) for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila was negative. According to these results, we initially suspected intraabdominal malignancy including malignant lymphoma. However, abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities. Therefore, we suspected miliary tuberculosis or pulmonary sarcoidosis. Liver, skin and bone marrow biopsies were subsequently performed and showed epithelioid cell granuloma without caseous necrosis. Gastric aspirate smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli and polymerase chain reaction (Loopamp; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although these microbiological findings might indicate the presence of non-viable M. tuberculosis, miliary tuberculosis was suspected and antimycobacterial therapy [oral isoniazid (INH) 200 mg/day, rifampicin (RFP) 300 mg/day and ethambutol (EB) 500 mg/day] was initiated on hospital day 12. Gastric aspirate culture was positive for M. tuberculosis after 1 week of culture. After a 2-month treatment course, chest radiograph showed gradual improvement, oral EB was discontinued and the patient was discharged. Although INH and RFP therapy was continued, chest radiograph showed new multiple nodules in the right middle lung field after a 6-month treatment course. Chest CT showed that a right S6 small nodule, presumed to be miliary tuberculosis, had increased and new multiple nodules appeared in the right lower lobe (Fig. ). The patient\u2019s white blood cell count and C-reactive protein at this time were 2400 /\u03bcl and 0.09 mg/dl, respectively. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was subsequently perfomed. Microbiological testing of bronchial lavage fluids did not reveal any bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi. However, cytology showed a small number of Periodic acid-Schiff-positive bodies, suggesting Cryptococcus species (Fig. ). Moreover, serum cryptococcal antigen testing (Serodirect \u201cEIKEN\u201d Cryptococcus; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was positive (\u00d7128). According to these findings, pulmonary cryptococcosis was diagnosed, although the culture was negative. Oral fluconazole (FLCZ; 300 mg/day) was subsequently initiated. After a 6-month treatment course, chest radiograph showed gradual improvement and oral FLCZ was discontinued. The patient received a total of 12 months of antimycobacterial therapy. On follow-up, she has remained asymptomatic with suspect to pulmonary disease, with no recurrence. What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?",

    "question": "History: A 37-year old female with history of migraine and recent diagnosis of hypertension presented to the ED complaining of chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion for two weeks prior to presentation. She described pressure in the sternal area of her chest, constant, 7/10, radiating to her back, her jaw and her right arm. Patient reported being admitted to a nearby hospital with similar symptoms a month earlier. She had a transient left bundle branch block (LBBB) on her electrocardiogram and was worked up for acute coronary syndrome. Her cardiac biomarkers were negative, and she underwent a stress echocardiogram during which she exercised for 6 minutes on a Bruce protocol, achieving 7.1 metabolic equivalents (METS), and had normal left ventricular chamber size diminution and a normal baseline ejection fraction (~65 percent). Exercise was stopped secondary to fatigue, and the only concerning finding was that she had septal hypokinesis that was read as possible ischemia versus a consequence of her LBBB.\nOn the basis of her abnormal stress echocardiogram she also underwent stress perfusion imaging that showed possible anterior ischemia \u2013 again in the setting of her LBBB. On this basis she underwent a coronary angiography at the local hospital that revealed no obstructive coronary disease. She was discharged home, with a diagnosis of non-cardiac chest pain.\nOver the next week, patient\u2019s symptoms worsened with chest pain radiating down right arm, associated with profound fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, tingling in the jaw. These symptoms disrupted her work as a postal worker and brought her to the second emergency department for evaluation.\nPast Surgical History: Right lower leg surgery for fracture, left ear surgery, laparoscopy, tonsillectomy.\nMedications: Aspirin 81 mg, multivitamins.\nAllergies: Bactrim, cephalosporins.\nFamily History: Mother had angioplasty at age 39, maternal grandfather with MI at 38, deceased from myocardial infarction (MI) at 42. Second cousin passed from massive MI at age 45.\nSocial History: Denies any current/past use/abuse of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs.

    "question": "A 66-year-old Caucasian man with no significant past medical history presented with flu-like symptoms, progressively worsening shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing (NYHA class III) and dry cough over the past 2 weeks prior to presentation. He denied any fever, chills, sputum production, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, anorexia, weight loss, recent or past exposure to tuberculosis, sick contacts, pets, recent travel or past exposure to cigarette smoke (active or passive), asbestos, silica, coal dust or chemicals. He maintained an active lifestyle walking 5 miles three times a week without overt dyspnea. He had no prior history of connective tissue disease or HIV and denied any history of skin rash or joint pains. Past surgical, social and family histories were non-contributory. He also had no history of prior use of any long term medications. He had presented to the hospital 4 days prior to present admission and a provisional diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia was made based on chest radiograph findings and he was discharged home on 2L of oxygen and Levofloxacin, but came back to the hospital due to lack of obvious improvement.\nOn examination, he appeared tired with shortness of breath. The temperature was 99.9\u00b0F, the pulse 124/min, respiratory rate 26/min and oxygen saturation of 86% on 2L. Skin was diaphoretic. There was no evidence of rash, pallor, lymphadenopathy, clubbing, joint swelling or edema. Auscultation of chest revealed diminished breath sounds with bilateral velcro-like fine inspiratory crackles. Laboratory studies showed a normal complete blood count, metabolic panel, liver function tests, cardiac enzymes, BNP, lactate, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen and TSH. D-dimer was elevated at 15.4 (normal <1.6). ESR was 52 mm/hour. Rheumatoid factor was <5 (negative). ANA, p-ANCA and c-ANCA were negative. Blood cultures (bacterial/fungal/mycobacterial), urine legionella and streptococcal antigen were negative. Viral respiratory panel, including cytomegalovirus & Herpes Simplex Virus PCR were also negative. ABG showed hypoxemia with respiratory alkalosis. Pulmonary function tests showed restrictive pattern of lung disease. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal cardiac chamber sizes and left ventricular ejection fraction of 81%.\nPlain chest radiograph (Fig. ) showed bilateral basilar infiltrates and a peripheral reticulonodular pattern superimposed on generalized interstitial changes, involving the upper lobes as well as lung bases. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest (Fig. and ) revealed moderate to severe thickening of intralobular septa, septal line formation, parenchymal band formation and peribronchial thickening, ground glass opacities and mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy (likely reactive, largest lymph node being 1.1 cm) was noted. This was consistent with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) without a specific pattern. At this time, treatment with levofloxacin was continued and solumedrol was added for empirical therapy. Computed Tomogram (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis was normal with no evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Despite steroid therapy, the patient's respiratory status deteriorated over the next day requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Consequently, consent for wedge biopsy of the lung was obtained for a pathological diagnosis to guide further therapy.\nA right lung wedge biopsy was obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). A polymorphic lymphoid infiltrate composed of large atypical cells, small lymphocytes and many plasma cells was noted, with lymphoid cells infiltrating blood vessels and bronchial walls (Fig. ). Multinucleated large Reed Sternberg-like cells were also present along with foci of necrosis. Bronchial washings showed atypical benign bronchial cells and pulmonary macrophages with a few rare atypical Reed-Sternberg-like cells. Bone marrow biopsy was normal.\nImmuno-histochemical studies of lung tissue showed predominance of T cells expressing CD3, CD5 and CD43 with a smaller population of large atypical cells expressing CD20 and CD79a (B cell markers) (Fig. ). Many CD138+ plasma cells exhibiting polyclonal staining pattern for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains were also seen. Bone marrow biopsy revealed normal cellularity with no evidence of lymphoma. In situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (EBER) was positive within scattered large lymphoid cells throughout the biopsy specimen (Fig. ).\nBased on the pathological and immuno-histochemical findings, a diagnosis of Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis was made. Treatment with high dose steroids and rituximab showed significant clinical improvement and he was extubated 4 days after starting therapy. Treatment was continued with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisolone chemotherapy and he showed gradual but slow resolution of clinical and x-ray findings. However, he subsequently developed pancytopenia consequent to chemotherapy, septic shock requiring increasing doses of pressors and acute renal failure which did not respond to aggressive management and he was terminally weaned per family wishes 4 weeks later. A chest-only autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage, likely secondary to sepsis or chemotherapy or both, but no evidence of residual LG was noted within the lungs (Fig. ).

    "question": "A 17-year-old female presented with 1-month history of more noticeable weight loss and increased tiredness. Over the last 6 years since immigrating to the United States with her family from Burma and going through puberty, her body habitus has changed to a very thin appearance. This period of time began with menarche, which subsequently demonstrated intermittent oligomenorrhea occasionally alternating with amenorrhea. Apparently, workup by a gynecologist was negative and a yearlong period of oral contraceptive use did little to change the scant flow pattern. She discontinued these 6 months ago. The patient\u2019s diet history revealed 3 meals a day of normal type foods but always smaller portions than other members of her family. Mother agreed that she does not eat much fried or fast foods, usually what is prepared for the family at home. The patient eventually suggested after repetitive questions that there was an increase in early satiety over the last month and she clearly was overall more tired. Five months ago, she had an outpatient visit for viral syndrome with vomiting and diarrhea, which resolved in 48 hours. At that time, her weight was 42 kg and no fever noted. Review of systems was notable for fatigue, intermittent chills, hair loss with nonvigorous brushing, intermittent \u201cshakiness\u201d when getting up, and shortness of breath on exertion. She denied any fever, upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, coughing, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, abdominal pain other than associated with her menstrual cycle, rashes, easy bruising or bleeding. Her past medical history was notable for the oligomenorrhea and scoliosis, but prior testing for anemia reported negative 6 months ago, and all chronic diseases, including in other members of the family, was denied, including anemia, thalassemia, and tuberculosis. The patient reports feeling \u201csad sometimes\u201d but denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. In the emergency department, her physical exam (PE) was notable for a tired appearing but otherwise well teenage girl with a temperature of 101.6\u00b0F, heart rate 125, respiratory rate 16, pulse oxygenation saturation of 97% on room air, weight 40 kg, height 144.78 cm, body mass index 20.1, some hair loss with brushing, II/VI systolic murmur over LUSB, and mild nonpitting bilateral edema. The remainder of the PE was unremarkable. Laboratory values were remarkable for white blood cell count 4700/\u00b5L with neutrophilic predominance, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, hematocrit 24.8%, mean corpuscular volume 74.9 fL, red cell distribution width 18.4%.

    "question": "A 56-year-old man presented to a peripheral hospital with a history of severe acute central chest pain accompanied by sweating. He has been suffering from diabetes mellitus for 3 years for which he was taking oral hypoglycemic agent (glibenclamide 5 mg, BID). However, he was not on regular follow-up. He was hypertensive for 3 years and for which he was on regular medication.\nHe was diagnosed with acute ST-segment elevation extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction and was given Streptokinase due to unavailability of reteplase/alteplase. Although the chest pain improved, his post lysis ECG showed poor resolution. However, next morning the ECG showed transient inferior leads ST elevation with fast atrial fibrillation (AF). He was given a bolus intravenous amiodarone (300 mg). While he was on amiodarone infusion, he became hypotensive and dobutamine was started at low dose (5 mcg/kg/min). Eventually, his case was discussed and it was decided he needed a tertiary care hospital. He was shifted with 12 hours for further management.\nOn arrival, his radial arterial blood pressure was 106/70 mmHg, mean arterial BP was 59 mmHg. He was maintained on low dose dobutamine. The PR was 96 b.p.m, in sinus rhythm. His urine output was 75 ml / hour. On physical examination, he had bilateral fine crepitation and a pan systolic murmur at the left lower sternal area, radiating to the right precordium. Further examination showed the jugular venous pulse was mildly raised but no lower leg edema and warm touch. Oxygen saturation was 98% on 4 L/min oxygen facemask.\nElectrocardiography [] revealed sinus rhythm with persistent ST-segment elevation in the anterior (V1-V6) with established Q-waves in anterior leads. Chest X-ray [] showed bilateral mild pulmonary congestion.\nTransthoracic echocardiography revealed multiple (2\u20133 mm) apical muscular ventricular septal defects (VSD) with the largest VSD measuring 1 cm [], and a left to right shunt []. Left ventricular (LV) systolic function was mildly impaired with an ejection fraction of 45%. The left ventricular apex was akinetic. There was Grade-I diastolic dysfunction with normal right side dimension and functions. There was no significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis, but there was moderate pericardial effusion measuring 1.6 cm posteriorly and 1.1 cm anteriorly []. There was no sign of cardiac tamponade. The results of the biochemical Labs were unremarkable except for mild renal impairment (creatinine 105 mmol/L, eGFR-65) and raised Troponin T (364 pg/ml). Lactate level was 2.1mmol/L.\nCoronary angiography (CAG) revealed the left anterior descending artery had tight lesions in the proximal (95%) and mid segment (85%) with diffusely diseased distal LAD []. Right coronary had proximal 30% stenosis; the right posterior descending artery had ostial (90%) lesion []. There was non-significant lesion at distal left circumflex artery. LV Angiography showed Apical VSR with LV to RV flow [Figure and ].\nHis Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) cardiogenic shock (CS) stage was determined to be Stage B. At this time cardiac surgeons were consulted, who advised to continue medical treatment with an intention to heal infarct area spontaneously and they would consider either for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) plus VSD repair versus Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) plus device closure.\nThe patient was initially treated medically with intravenous diuretics, inotropes, and with oral aspirin and statin. Gradually, all inotropes were tapered off and he was clinically asymptomatic with stable hemodynamics without support of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Later, low dose of lisinopril and carvedilol was added as vasodilators to reduce afterload.\nEventually, at the eighteenth day of admission, the patient underwent CABG (one venous graft to r-PDA) with simultaneous repair of VSD with Gortex patch with infarct exclusion technique. The LAD artery could not be grafted due to poor visualization hence dit was decided for PCI later if needed.\nPostoperatively, the patient remained stable and was extubated the next day. Follow-up echocardiography revealed no residual intra-cardiac shunt. He was discharged on the 7th post-operative day in stable condition. Due to expatriate issue, a follow-up was arranged over telephone at 2 weeks. After two months, he was asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable and could perform routine daily activities. Later a clinic follow- up was arranged with echocardiography. What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?",

His medical history was significant for stage IV clear cell RCC, chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation with warfarin, coronary artery disease status post the placement of two stents with an ischaemic cardiomyopathy and a LVEF of 40%\u201345%. He was recently started on pazopanib for systemic treatment of metastatic RCC. Pazopanib was started at 75% of the recommended dose. At the initiation of therapy, the patient had a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and was able to walk 90 min a day without any complaints.\nWithin the first week of starting pazopanib, the patient developed dyspnoea on exertion that progressed rapidly to dyspnoea on minimal exertion. He was no longer able to conduct his daily walks. On the 10th day after starting pazopanib, he was unable to shave himself due to dyspnoea, which prompted his ED presentation. In the ED, his blood pressure (BP) was 122/70 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) was 93 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate (RR) was 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. On physical examination, auscultation of the heart was significant for an irregular rhythm with no additional heart sounds or signs of volume overload. His lungs were clear to auscultation, and the remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\nInitial labs were significant for a creatinine of 1.4 mg/mL and a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio of 4.0. Blood counts, electrolytes and liver function tests were within normal limits. His B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 2685 pg/mL. His troponin results were negative. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without significant changes compared with previous tracings. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest in the ED showed heterogeneous opacification of the left main pulmonary artery with concern for a non-occlusive thrombus.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and empirically started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin for presumed pulmonary embolism (PE). On the second day, he presented with worsening shortness of breath and compromised mental status. On physical examination, he was dyspnoeic and tachypnoeic with RR of 40 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 95% on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. His HR ranged between 140 and 150 bpm and his BP was 96/53 mm Hg. He was in respiratory distress, unable to speak in full sentences but alert and following commands.

    "question": "A 69-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital after returning from a one-month vacation to Myanmar that included horseback riding. The patient had not taken malaria prophylaxis and did not receive any vaccinations prior to his departure. The patient's medical history was remarkable for gout, ciguatera, and neurosurgical reconstruction of the skull after a basilar skull fracture. The latter occurred 5 years before this event (after a fall from a horse), and it was complicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and right-sided glossopharyngeal and vagal nerve damage, which resulted in right-sided vocal cord paralysis with hoarseness and sporadic aspiration. The patient did not take any medications and did not smoke, but he drank wine regularly.\nFor the last few days, the patient had been increasingly tired and somnolent, with complaints of headache, left-sided ear pain, and night sweats. One day prior to admission, the patient had become increasingly confused. On the day of his admission, he was found by his wife lying on the floor of his home, confused, agitated, shivering, and incontinent of urine. At the emergency department, the patient's temperature was 39.2 \u00b0C, and his heart rate was 111 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a blood pressure of 161/88 mmHg. The patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was 87%, and his Glasgow Coma Scale was scored as 9 (E2 M5 V2). Clinical examination revealed fasciculations of the face and lower legs and crepitation over the right lower lung on pulmonary auscultation. There was no purpura or nuchal rigidity.\nAt that time, blood results revealed a leukocyte count of 34 900 \u00d7 109/l (normal: 4 300\u201310 000) (>95% being neutrophils) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 204 mg/l (normal value <3). A chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. A CT scan of the brain showed only nonspecific white matter lesions but no haemorrhage or oedema. Lumbar puncture examination revealed a leukocyte count of 1160/mm3 (almost all neutrophils), a normal glucose level, and a total protein level of 128 mg/dl (normal value 15\u201340) accompanied by an elevated lactate level of 6.1 meq/l. Gram stain showed irregularly shaped cocci. Bacterial meningitis was suspected, and after obtaining two sets of blood cultures, empirical therapy with 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone every 12 h, 2 g of ampicillin every 4 h and 10 mg/kg of acyclovir every 8 h was initiated. Shortly after starting the antibiotic therapy, the patient became more somnolent and developed a left-sided hemiplegia, left-sided central facial palsy, and right-sided head and eye deviation, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Because of increasingly obstructive respirations and an increasing oxygen need by the next day, the patient was intubated and ventilated.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures showed \u03b2-hemolytic colonies; blood and CSF cultures were positive for Streptococcus equi. Intravenous treatment with 2 g of ceftriaxone every 12 h was continued for 21 days, while ampicillin and acyclovir were discontinued. In vitro testing confirmed a sensitivity to ceftriaxone. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (FLAIR) showed a \u201cdirty CSF\u201d appearance in the right parietal region (, white arrow). Axial () and sagittal () T1-weighted images after the intravenous administration of gadolinium-chelate revealed a focal area of superficial contrast enhancement overlying the cerebral cortex, presumably representing a thickened pia mater and opacification of the left mastoid. In view of the MRI lesions and the left hemiplegia, one gram of intravenous methylprednisolone once daily was added to the treatment for 3 days with gradual tapering afterwards because meningoencephalitis with accompanying cerebral vasculitis was suspected []. After 4 days, the patient was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Initially, the patient remained very agitated and disoriented and was temporarily treated with 25 mg of twice daily quetiapine and 100 mg of daily trazodone. Nine days after admission to the ICU, the patient was transferred to the neurology department. Later, this Streptococcus equi was identified as S. equi subspecies equi (at the National Reference Center for Invasive Non-Group B Beta-Hemolytic Streptococci, Belgium).\nThe patient initially recovered completely and had no complaints apart from mild gait disturbances and light-headedness at a follow-up appointment 3 months after discharge. Because of the patient's prior medical history of basilar skull fracture and opacification of the left mastoid on brain MRI, despite a lack of clinical evidence of acute otitis or mastoiditis, an additional CT scan of the base of the skull was performed to rule out possible portals of entry for central nervous system (CNS) infection. The CT scan revealed only an asymmetrical widening of the left squamosal suture; therefore, we opted for a conservative approach.\nOne month later (5 months after the initial referral), the patient was readmitted with intracranial bleeding, and consecutive CT scans showed multiple right-sided cerebral haemorrhages, with the largest located precentrally in the frontal lobe with small perilesional parietal and temporal haemorrhages accompanied by a left hemiparesis and aphasia (). CT angiography examination (, para-axial MPR) showed multiple tortuous, engorged pial veins of the right hemisphere. Cerebral angiography confirmed the presence of a suspected superficial dural arteriovenous fistula (, lateral projection of right internal carotid artery injection, large black arrow) in the right parietal region. The arterial feeders were mainly meningeal branches originating from the right ophthalmic artery and transosseous feeders from the right superficial temporal and occipital arteries (, lateral projection right external carotid artery injection); in addition, there was limited arterial supply to the fistula from the left middle meningeal artery across the midline (not shown). Venous drainage was through a large, right temporal draining vein (large white arrow) with reflux into multiple tortuous, superficial frontotemporal veins, as shown in , indicating a fistula with high risk of haemorrhage.\nComparison of the axial T2-weighted images of MRI examinations at initial admittance () and at the second admission () showed the new finding of dilated pial veins (encircled), demonstrating de novo development of the dural AV fistula.\nThe dural AV fistula was excised by the neurosurgeon. Microscopy of the resected dura showed a previously damaged vein with inflammatory remnants and granulation tissue in its wall (Figures and ). The patient was discharged to home with a hemiparesis that was still present. Seven months later, after this second event, the patient's GCS was 15/15, and the hemiparesis had almost completely disappeared.

    "question": "A 52-year-old male was brought to the emergency department (ED) via emergency medical services (EMS) with complaints of chest pain and pressure after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was the restrained driver in a collision while traveling at approximately 45 miles per hour when a car turned in front of him at an intersection. His airbags deployed; he did not lose consciousness and was able to self-extricate from the vehicle. After extrication, he started to experience substernal chest pressure, which was not present prior to the accident. When EMS arrived he was placed in a cervical collar and given aspirin, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained (). He was transported to the ED.\nOn arrival, a repeat ECG was performed, and the emergency physician alerted a cardiac activation given concern for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He complained of substernal chest pain and pressure that was non-radiating and exacerbated by deep inspiration. Additional review of systems was negative.\nOn examination in the ED, the patient\u2019s temperature was 36.6\u00b0 Celsius, heart rate 76 beats per minute, respirations 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure 102/60 millimeters mercury, and an oxygen saturation of 97%. He was in no acute distress. He had tenderness to palpation over the sternum with no evidence of contusion or seatbelt sign on chest or abdomen. He had no abnormalities on cardiac, lung, or abdominal exams. He had no bony point tenderness of extremities and had full range of motion of all extremities.\nHe had no prior medical history but had not had regular medical care in the prior 30 years. He had smoked 1.5 packs per day of cigarettes for many years, consumed alcohol on social occasions, and denied recreational drug use. He had no known drug allergies. He had never had surgery. He denied any family history of coronary artery disease and denied any personal history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or coronary artery disease.\nChest radiography demonstrated only mild left lung base atelectasis. Point-of-care echocardiography by the cardiology service was limited by difficult windows and pain on transducer pressure, but demonstrated a relatively preserved ejection fraction, no pericardial effusion, and no obvious wall motion abnormalities. Initial troponin-I was elevated at 0.045 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) (reference range 0.02\u20130.04 ng/mL), and B-type natriuretic peptide was 10 picograms (pg)/mL (<=99 pg/mL).\nWhile the diagnosis of cardiac contusion was entertained, the field ECG could not be ignored. With no contraindications to angiography identified, the patient was fully anticoagulated and taken emergently for coronary angiography. Coronary angiogram demonstration 100% occlusion of the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) without dissection (). There was also a mid-right coronary artery (RCA) ragged 70\u201390% lesion. After intervention on the LAD lesion, the patient\u2019s pain subsided. The next day, he complained of chest pain on deep inspiration and chest heaviness. He had a staged intervention of the RCA the following day. In the interim, he was discovered to have a sternal fracture by computed tomography ().

His symptoms continued to progress to the point that he was having difficulty breathing and starting to have trouble walking for which EMS was called. Per EMS, they noted rapidly progressing symptoms while en route to the ED. Vitals on arrival to the ED are as follows: 94.5 \u00b0F, blood pressure of 91/64 mmHg, heart rate of 109 beats/min, respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min, and 100% pulse oximetry on room air. On physical exam, he was toxic appearing, in acute distress, and diaphoretic. Jugular venous distention was present. Cardiopulmonary exam was notable for tachycardia, distant heart sounds, and the presence of bibasilar rales. His skin/lower extremities were pale, mottled, and he was unable to move them. Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally, radial pules 1+ bilaterally, femoral pulses 1+ bilaterally, with absent popliteal pulses. On neurological exam, he had dysarthric speech, left-sided facial droop, and loss of strength and sensation in his lower extremities.\nThe patient was placed on non-invasive positive pressure. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia with premature atrial complexes, a right bundle branch block, with non-specific ST/T wave changes in the anterior leads. Portable chest radiography taken in an upright position (Fig. ) demonstrated a widened mediastinum at about 10.5 cm. A bedside point of care cardiac ultrasound revealed a significant pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was unremarkable for any acute process. Pertinent laboratory evaluation:\nHemoglobin of 9.2 (13.5\u201317 g/dL) Arterial blood gas: pH 7.01, pCO2 45, p02 116, HCO3 12 Initial lactic acid of 8.3 (0.5\u20132.2 mmol/L) that increased to 14.8 Blood/urea/nitrogen of 42 (8\u201322 mg/dL) Creatinine of 3.06 (0.6\u20131.4 mg/dL).\nCT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast revealed a Stanford type A dissection with an intimal tear beginning at the level of the aortic root and extending throughout the course of the thoracic aorta and into the abdominal aorta (Figs. , , and ). Additional findings on CT included involvement of the origins of the great vessels (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery). Hemopericardium is visualized with high suspicion for pericardial tamponade. There is dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 5.2 cm. The dissection continues distally (Figs. and ) to involve the left common iliac artery and bilateral external iliac arteries.\nHe was transferred emergently to a tertiary center and was taken immediately to the operating room for definitive repair. The patient underwent sternotomy, repair of Stanford type A dissection with right groin cannulation, and repair of the right femoral artery and vein. He arrived in the surgical intensive care unit in guarded condition, his sternotomy was left open secondary to severe coagulopathy intraoperatively, and he was on an epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin infusion. By day 2, continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) was initiated for acute tubular necrosis. Vascular surgery was consulted to evaluate a pulseless right lower extremity status post right femoral artery cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Given the patient had an open sternotomy with five chest tubes with significant output requiring transfusion of multiple blood products throughout the night, vascular surgery could not perform a femoral-femoral bypass or axillofemoral bypass without heparinization.\nBy day 3, he underwent mediastinal irrigation and sternal closure with cardiothoracic surgery. He was then taken for a right common femoral endarterectomy, iliofemoral and lower extremity embolectomy, and right lower extremity four-compartment fasciotomy secondary to acute ischemia of the right lower extremity. In addition, neurosurgery evaluated the patient because he was not spontaneously moving his extremities after surgery and there was concern that the dissection had caused an infarction of his thoracic spinal cord, resulting in paraplegia. By day 4, he remained stuporous off sedation and on maximum pressor support (norepinephrine infusion at 30 mcg/min, epinephrine infusion at 10 mcg/min, and a vasopressin infusion at 0.04 units/min). He continued to have upper extremity non-epileptic myoclonic jerks secondary to continued renal failure. CT of the head revealed multiple 1 to 2 cm foci consistent with likely subacute infarcts related to embolic disease. By day 5, a family discussion was had regarding a poor neurological prognosis for independent neurological recovery with likely permanent cognitive and motor deficits. His code status was subsequently changed to do not resuscitate (DNR) with no further escalation of care. The patient continued to deteriorate throughout the night, became asystolic, and expired.

    "question": "A 37-year-old male visited the emergency department at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, presenting with a chief complaint of dyspnea. Initial symptoms had begun 1 week prior to his visit, characterized by fever and chills, followed by progressive respiratory difficulty. He appeared acutely ill. A crackling sound was heard upon chest examination. His heartbeat was regular without a murmur. A purplish discoloration of the right ankle was observed, but there were no local heat or tenderness. Initial blood pressure was 163/91 mmHg, pulse rate was 114 beats/min, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, and body temperature was 38\u2103. Oxygen saturation was initially detected as 87%, and increased to 95% upon oxygen supplement via nasal cannula at 5 L/min. Following oxygen supplementation, arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40.9 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 113.7 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.\nLaboratory tests revealed peripheral eosinophilia and thrombocytopenia with a white blood cell count of 22,580/\u00b5L (50% neutrophils, 31% eosinophils, 10% lymphocytes), Hb levels at 13.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 26,000/\u00b5L. Prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times were 15 sec, and 35.4 sec respectively. Fibrinogen levels were within the normal range, but the concentration of D-dimer was markedly elevated at 26.69 \u00b5g/mL. Serum total IgE and ECP levels (939.4 IU/mL and 201.0 ng/mL, respectively) were both elevated, too. Tests for both anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. A test for parasites in the stool and serum were negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed normal cellularity with increased eosinophils. Fip1-like1 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) gene fusion was not detected. Patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacity in both lower lung zones was noticed in the initial chest radiography ().\nDuring the initial workup, the patient became progressively tachypneic with increased oxygen demand to 15 L/min via facial mask. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and oxygen supply was increased to 100% by high-flow nasal cannula. Despite supplementation, PaO2 levels remained low (49.9 mmHg) leading to a diagnosis of ARDS, and then the patient underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation.\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed marked eosinophilia (187/200 evaluated cells, 93.5% eosinophils). Skin biopsy of the right ankle showed diffuse eosinophilic perivascular infiltration of the dermis () and eosinophilic abscess of subcutaneous fat (). Duplex sonography revealed deep vein thrombosis in the left popliteal, soleal, and peroneal veins. Nerve conduction test and electromyography showed neuropathy in the right posterior tibial nerve.\nA diagnosis of IHES was reached based on the presence of peripheral and tissue eosinophilia, along with the exclusion of other causes of eosinophilia. High-dose corticosteroid (methylprednisone 1 mg/kg/day) therapy was initiated on the first day of admission. By day 3, eosinophil counts decreased to the normal range (). Extubation was performed on day 4 as a result of clinical and radiological improvements.\nA chest CT scan was obtained on day 9 to evaluate symptoms of mild dyspnea despite the dramatic improvement seen by simple radiography (). Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) was detected in the bilateral lobar and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries (), and we started anticoagulant therapy. On day 23, the patient was discharged from the hospital with a gradual tapering of corticosteroids. What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?",

    "question": "A 26-year-old male patient with no remarkable medical and social history presented with a five-day history of a cough and fever. Before coming to our hospital, he went to a clinic and received amoxicillin, which resulted in no improvement of his symptoms. He visited another hospital three days before presenting to us and was hospitalized with a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Although he received tazobactam/piperacillin, his clinical symptoms showed deterioration. Two days later, he was admitted to our hospital.\nHis vital signs were as follows: temperature, 38.1\u00b0C, heart rate of 112 beats/min, blood pressure of 98/60\u202fmmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and saturation of peripheral oxygen of 94% with a reservoir mask of 6 L/min. On physical examination, weak respiratory sounds and coarse crackles were heard in the lower left chest.\nHis initial white blood cell count was 6,800/\u03bcL, hemoglobin was 14.0g/dL, platelet count was 133,000/\u03bcL, and C-reactive protein level was 34.30 mg/dL (). Arterial blood gas (reservoir mask of 6 L/min) showed that the pH was 7.44, PCO2 was 41.1 mmHg, PO2 was 69.2 mmHg, HCO3\u2212 was 27.2 mmol/l, and BE was 2.8 mmol/L. Among the viral and bacterial rapid tests performed, only the Mycoplasma antigen tested positive.\nChest radiography indicated an infiltrating shadow in left middle lung field and right lower lung field.

    "question": "A 71-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department after being found unconscious and hypoxemic in front of his house. He had a history of alcohol- and nicotine-abuse and lived a reclusive life. One week prior he had visited his general practitioner because of dyspnea. He was prescribed oral steroids and bronchodilators for presumed exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nOn physical examination he looked ill, was haemodynamically stable and hypercapnic. His body temperature was 37.2 \u00b0C. His blood pressure was 154/66 mmHg, with a regular pulse of 116 beats min\u22121. He was tachypneic, respiration rate of 27 min\u22121, with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 97 % with a non-rebreathing mask. Lung auscultation revealed weak breath sounds. Further physical examination revealed a wound between his first and second toe on his right foot in which a great number of maggots were present (). Signs of chronic venous insufficiency were present, but no signs of arterial insufficiency. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Haematological and biochemical investigations showed a white blood cell count of 17.9\u00d7109 l\u22121[reference range (ref.) 4\u201310\u00d7109 l\u22121], with 81 % neutrophils (ref. 40\u201375 %), C-reactive protein 51 mg l\u22121 (ref. <10), glucose level of 257.6 mg dl\u22121 (ref. 72.1\u2013115.1) and otherwise normal results for haemoglobin level, platelet count, liver enzymes, electrolytes and creatinine. Arterial blood-gas analysis showed a marked respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.19 and pCO2 of 12.1 kPa. A chest X-ray did not reveal signs of pneumonia. He was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit and non-invasive ventilation was started with a diagnosis of exacerbation of his COPD without an apparent trigger, possibly upper respiratory tract infection. Steroids, bronchodilators and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) were given. Two days later he was transferred to the pulmonology ward. Two blood culture sets each containing one aerobic and one anaerobic bottle (BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F and Anaerobic/F Culture Vials using the BACTEC FX system; Becton Dickinson) drawn upon admission revealed growth of Gram-negative rods in one of the aerobic bottles after incubation for 48 h. Upon subculturing of the Gram-negative rod, an oxidase-positive, aerobic, catalase-positive strain was found. Determination by Vitek2Combo with ID-GN card (bioM\u00e9rieux) revealed Acinetobacter iwoffii with 98 % probabil ity. API NE tests (bioM\u00e9rieux) could not assign the strain to a specific species. The above results were conflicting with colony morphology and oxidase reaction. A RapID-ANA test (Remel) was done to test for enzymatic reactions that could possibly provide a clue to the identification. Positive reactions for urease, arginine and serine hydrolysis were found. Although we even considered this strain to be a non-fermentative contaminant, the combination of the positive oxidase reaction and the growth characteristics finally let us consider Wohlfahrtiimonas species as we knew the patient had a wound full with maggots. However , a positive urease reaction is not compatible with Wohlfahrtiimonas. We offered the strain to an external laboratory (BaseClear, Leiden, The Netherlands) for identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (VITEK MS; bioM\u00e9rieux) and MicroSEQ analysis, a 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing method (Life Technologies). MALDI-TOF MS did not reveal a reliable result (VITEK MS industry database v2.0) and even the MicroSEQ analysis with the validated database was unsuccessful. To our complete surprise a species of the genusIgnatzschineria was identified when the 489 basepair 16S rRNA gene sequence was blasted against the NCBI and SMARTgene databases. The colony morphology, growth characteristics, oxidase and urease reaction were all compatible with this identification as well as the clinical story. The complete 16S rRNA gene was amplified and analysed. The resulting sequence (1392 nucleotides) showed 98.7, 98.5 and 98.2 % similarity, respectively to the type strains of Ignatzschineria ureiclastica, Ignatzschineria larvae and Ignatzschineria indica (GenBank accession numbers , and ). shows a phylogenetic tree displaying the relations with close proximate species. The sequence was submitted to the GenBank database and assigned accession number . Antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by Etest (bioM\u00e9rieux) revealed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid of 0.25 mg l\u22121, amoxicillin 0.047 mg l\u22121 and ciprofloxacin 0.064 mg l\u22121. A beta-lactamase test (Oxoid) was positive. According to EUCAST non-species related breakpoints all these antibiotics could be considered sensitive based on Pk/Pd data. The positive beta-lactamase test argues against amoxicillin as appropriate treatment. The in vitro sensitivity to amoxicillin by Etest in conjunction with a positive beta-lactamase test is suggestive of an inducible beta-lactamase. A culture of the wound on the right foot of the patient taken two days after start of antimicrobial treatment and admission did only reveal Providencia stuartii. Even with the knowledge of the blood culture result we could not find species of the genus Ignatzschineria in this culture. A two-week course of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was completed with good clinical response. The wound on the patient's foot was successfully treated with application of povidone-iodine (betadine) and low adherent highly absorbent (melonin) dressings. His pulmonary condition improved, elevated glucose level and venous insufficiency were taken care of and he gradually improved and was discharged three weeks after admission.

Hemodynamically, he showed a stable profile with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 84 bpm. His body temperature was 38.1\u00b0C. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated C-reactive protein concentration of 37 mg/L (reference: <5 mg/L), a leukocyte count of 7.7 \u00d7 109/L (reference: 4\u201310 \u00d7 109/L) and D-dimer of 0.41 mg/L (reference: <0.50 mg/L). The chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral basal consolidations. The suspicion of Covid-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples.\nThe patient was primarily admitted to a designated Covid-19 ward for further observation and oxygen therapy. Due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure within 24 h after admission, he was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he was intubated. On the 5th day of ICU admission (T0), the patient developed a high fever accompanied with an increase in inflammatory parameters (). Hemodynamic parameters did not indicate an unstable course (). Microcirculatory monitoring was carried out sublingually using Cytocam-IDF imaging (CytoCam, Braedius Medical, Huizen, The Netherlands). Image analysis which was performed offline using MicroTools, showed an increase in microcirculatory density (total vessel density and perfused vessel density) and perfusion parameters (proportion of perfused vessels and microvascular mean flow index) as well as in red blood cell (RBC) velocity (). Subsequent CT-scan demonstrated extensive subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum as well as a thrombus in the right jugular vein extending to the superior vena cava and into the right brachial vein (). A tracheal defect was ruled out by bronchoscopy. There was no pneumothorax or evidence of esophageal rupture.\nThe patient was ventilated for 19 days and a temporary tracheostomy was performed for a gradual wean from the ventilator. Unfractionated heparin was given in therapeutic doses for his venous thrombus. Chest CT obtained at 19th (T1) and 25th day of ICU admission (T2) showed complete resorption of mediastinal air and venous thrombus (). Concurrent microcirculatory images revealed a recovery of microcirculatory alterations ( and ).

Her examination was remarkable for an overweight, diaphoretic female in distress with abdominal tenderness and cold and clammy extremities.\nAn electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia and diffuse ST-segment elevation in I, II, augmented Vector Left (aVL), and V3-V6 (Figure ).\nLaboratory testing was remarkable for a white blood cell count of 3.8 103/uL (reference range: 4.0 - 11.0 103/uL), platelets 144 103/uL, (reference range 150 - 400 103/uL), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.26 (reference range 0.8 - 1.1), lactic acid 2.97 mmol/L (reference range: 0.5 - 2.00 mmol/L), ferritin 562 ng/mL (reference range: 13 - 150 ng/mL), C-reactive protein (CRP) 24.1 mg/L, (reference range: 0 - 5 mg/L); serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 141 U/L (reference range: 10 - 34 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 464 U/L (reference range: 135 - 235 U/L), creatine kinase (CK) 693 U/L (reference range: 26 - 192 U/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) 4,585 pg/mL (reference range: 0 - 450 pg/mL), and troponin T 0.43 ng/mL (reference: 0 - 0.02). The chest x-ray showed patchy infiltrates bilaterally (Figure ). SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive.\nThe patient initially received 2 liters of normal saline, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg, aspirin 325 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg for presumptive COVID-19-associated myocarditis. She improved symptomatically and remained hemodynamically stable. Two hours later, she became lethargic with a heart rate of 130 bpm. Pulses were unmeasurable. She received another liter bolus of normal saline and was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit. A bedside echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 10% with global hypokinesis and no pericardial effusion.\nUltimately, the patient developed cardiogenic shock. She was intubated and started initially on norepinephrine and subsequently required additional pressor support with phenylephrine and dopamine. She received intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. She subsequently became asystolic. She received four doses of intravenous (IV) epinephrine and 1 ampule of IV bicarbonate. The patient expired after 15 minutes of resuscitation. What are the number of criteria met for the PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?",

    "question": "A 38-year-old Caribbean-Black (Afro-Trinidadian) female with a medical history of endometriosis, intermittently adherent with the oral contraceptive pill, initially presented to the adult emergency department with acute dyspnea during the preceding 2 days. Her vital signs reflected systolic blood pressures of 142 mm Hg, heart rate of 112 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Her physical examination revealed a mildly elevated jugular venous pulse (10 cm of water), right chest stony dullness, no peripheral edema, and active menses.\nA 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with an incomplete right bundle branch block, right ventricular hypertrophy, and subtle secondary ST-T segment changes (see ). A portable chest radiograph revealed a large-sized, right pleural effusion with mild perihilar congestion (see ). Pertinent diagnostic laboratory investigations included a D-dimer 208 ng/dL (normal \u2264500 ng/mL), pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) 323 pg/mL (normal \u2264300 pg/mL), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) 0.08 ng/mL (normal = 0.0-0.15 ng/mL). The patient\u2019s arterial blood gas was consistent with mild hypoxia on 24% fractional inspiration of oxygen (FiO2) with an alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a gradient) of 14 mm Hg.\nThe patient was subsequently admitted for an inpatient hospitalization, and computed tomography (CT)-guided therapeutic thoracentesis was performed with a resultant hemorrhagic exudative effusion. Despite this intervention, the pleural effusion recurred within 48 hours, and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleural biopsy, which later affirmed the presence of endometrial tissue on clinicopathological examination. The tentative diagnosis at this juncture was recurrent catamenial pleural effusions. On further interview, the patient acknowledged that she often experienced dyspneic episodes during menstruation.\nDuring the ensuing hospitalization, she continued to experience persistent shortness of breath with an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). A 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed preserved left ventricular function with moderate right heart enlargement, septal flattening, and mild pHTN with estimated right ventricular systolic pressures of approximately 45 mm Hg. A 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram (2D/3D-TEE) also revealed an intact interatrial septum with agitated saline \u201cbubble\u201d study. The PVs were incompletely visualized and hence the rationale for further advanced imaging (see ). A cardiac CT angiogram (CCTA) affirmed the presence of the suspected PAPVC of the left inferior PV to the left brachiocephalic (innominate) vein with angiographically normal coronary arteries (see ). The patient also underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), which demonstrated the same aberrant connection with the remaining pulmonary venous vasculature appearing dilated in addition to the RA, right ventricle, and main pulmonary artery (see and , respectively). Left heart catheterization established angiographically normal coronary arteries with right heart catheterization revealing a significant hemodynamic left-to-right shunt with Qp:Qs ratio of 3:1, mild pHTN, and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (see for a summary of the pertinent cardiovascular investigations).\nCardiothoracic surgery was reconsulted regarding the surgical repair of the PAPVC. In the interim, the patient was instituted on an optimal cardiovascular regimen that included apixaban for her PAF, angiotensin receptor blocker with a neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), \u03b2-blocker (BB), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) for her heart failure and nitrates, tadalafil, and calcium channel blockade (CCB) for her pHTN. The rest of her hospital course was uneventful, and she was discharged home with scheduled corrective surgery in 2 months (due to our limited resource setting pending consultation from an international specialist CHD cardiothoracic surgeon).

On admission, his vital signs were a blood pressure of 144/83 mmHg, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, O2 saturation of 40% (room air), and temperature of 38 \u00b0C. On physical examination, he was found to be febrile, somnolent, and polypneic, with marked respiratory effort. Emergency orotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit were necessary.\nInitial screening showed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 138 \u00d7 103 cells/\u00b5l), leukocytosis (WBC 15,760 cells/ml, 90% neutrophils) with lymphopenia (6.20% lymphocytes), elevated transaminases (ALT 1507.4 IU and AST 3049.7 IU), elevated d-dimer (44,066 \u00b5g/ml), and negative RT-PCR SARS CoV-2 test. Chest X-ray showed extensive interstitial infiltrates in both lung fields (Fig. b). Considering the progressive decrease in total platelet count as well as gradual lymphopenia (Fig. ), a dengue IgM/IgG test was conducted and was positive, while the dengue PCR-RT test was negative. According to radiographic findings and respiratory involvement, the RT-PCR test for SARS CoV-2 was repeated on two more occasions, with negative results. Therefore, IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 were assayed and were positive.\nPositive serology for both SARS CoV-2 and dengue virus confirmed coinfection, so it was considered that he had probably entered a late stage of the disease. Steroid management was indicated according to COVID-19 management guidelines, in addition to pronation cycles, to which he presented poor response and persistent hypoxemia. During his stay in intensive care, he presented multiple complications, such as acute pulmonary embolism, with signs of secondary thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, bacterial superinfection in his lungs by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Akin III acute renal failure. Computerized tomography angiography of the chest was performed, which confirmed acute pulmonary thromboembolism of multiple bilateral lobar and segmental bilateral branches with signs of secondary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary changes suggestive of organizing pneumonia secondary to viral infection (Fig. ). Details of the clinical description of the coinfection are presented in Table . The patient remained in the ICU for COVID-19, bacterial superinfection, and dengue with alarm signs for 63 days. His progression was slow, showing progressive clinical deterioration. He required prolonged mechanical ventilation and vasopressor management until he finally died.

    "question": "A previously healthy 55-year-old woman with confirmed COVID-19 infection was hospitalised due to fatigue and near-syncope. Nine days prior to admission, her daughter returned from another European country and 3 days thereafter the daughter developed upper airways symptoms. The next day (day 0), the patient developed fatigue and unspecific body discomfort, with no airway symptoms. COVID-19 was confirmed in both the next days. Her medical condition improved temporarily until hospitalisation on day 7 due to several episodes of near-syncope and increased body and chest discomfort.\nBy admittance to hospital, the patient was isolated due to the COVID-19 infection. Blood pressure was 102/72 mm Hg, heart rate was 100 beats/min, respiratory rate was 17/min and rectal temperature was 37.2\u00b0C. Clinical examination revealed normal organ findings including pulmonary and cardiac examination. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia, insignificant ST-elevation in inferior leads and T-wave inversion in precordial leads (). Furthermore, there was low-voltage ECG with peak-to-peak QRS amplitude less than 5 mm in the standard leads and 10 mm in the precordial leads (V5 and V6). All ECG findings were stationary during the course. Laboratory findings showed glucose 7.2 mmol/L, normal electrolytes, mild elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) 11 and significantly elevated leucocyte count 13.2\u00d7109/L, troponin T 108 ng/L, NT-proBNP 1025 ng/L. Comprehensive description of laboratory tests and therapy is shown in . Bedside cardiac ultrasound examination performed by the on-call cardiac resident using a hand-held ultrasound device revealed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced left ventricular EF, dilated inferior caval vein with reduced respiratory variation and pericardial effusion at a maximum of 18 mm, a small right ventricle and a slight impression of the right atrium (). She was subsequently transferred to the ICU and treated with fluid support and norepinephrine. Day to day fluid and pressor treatment are highlighted in . The results of the point-of-care ultrasound examination were confirmed by echocardiography at the ICU. The left ventricle presented with a moderate concentric hypertrophy with a small cavity with end-diastolic volume less than 70 mL. Furthermore, there was a striking hyperechogenic pattern of the endocardium and epicardium ( and ). She deteriorated the following day with decreasing blood pressure and diuresis, with only a modest response on supportive treatment with fluid and pressor (norepinephrine (NA) and dobutamine). Fluid support was provided due to extensive peripheral capillary leakage. The extremities were cold and wet, but cognition was normal and beside international normalization ratio (INR) 1.2\u20131.3 there was no other sign of organ failure. Pericardiocentesis was performed at day 9 due to subacute deterioration and echocardiographic signs of a tamponade including compression of the right atrium, dilated inferior vena cava without inspiratory diameter reduction and respiratory variation in volumes and flow velocities ( and ). After initial drainage of 300 mL of serosal pericardial fluid, there was an immediate reduction of the respiratory variation of inflow patterns. The systolic blood pressure increased from 60 mm Hg to 95 mm Hg followed by increased diuresis. Size and function of the cardiac chambers together with mitral inflow pattern and filling of the left ventricle normalised gradually over the following days (, ). The left ventricular myocardial thickness and striking echogenicity were reduced in the same period. Cardiac output and blood pressure improved correspondingly. The patient needed supportive fluid therapy due to capillary leakage until day 15 when she was transferred to the ward.\nThe pericardial fluid tested negative in PCR for COVID-19. Cardiac (CMRI) study performed at day 15 was consistent with the diagnosis of acute perimyocarditis. T1-mapping showed relaxation times of 1260\u20131270 ms in the anterolateral wall compared with 1090 ms in the septum. The corresponding T2-mapping relaxation times were 60\u201361 ms and 52\u201353 ms, respectively. Inversion recovery sequences showed a moderate epicardial late gadolinium enhancement in the anterolateral wall ().

White blood cell count was 12 900/\u03bcL (normal value: 4000\u20137500/\u03bcL) and brain natriuretic peptide was 110 pg/mL (normal value: <18.4 pg/mL); other laboratory values were within normal range. The echocardiogram did not show any wall motion abnormality, significant valve disease, right ventricle dilation, or obvious congenital heart disease such as a patent foramen ovale. His chest CT with contrast showed bilateral scattered PE and left deep vein thrombus (from popliteal vein to soleus vein) (). After admission, his chest pain persisted, and the serum troponin I level and ECG were checked repeatedly. Although his serial ECG did not show no significant changes (), his serum troponin I level 3 h after the admission was elevated to 0.90 ng/mL. Furthermore, reconstruction of the SDCT (IQon Spectral CT; Philips healthcare) images clearly showed a perfusion defect of the posterolateral left ventricle myocardium (), suggesting a combination of PE and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).\nFollowing these findings, coronary angiogram was then performed which showed total occlusion of the OM branch. Although atherosclerotic plaques were seen in multiple coronary arteries, significant stenosis was not observed except for the OM branch (). Consequently, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed to the occlusion site. After thrombectomy, intracoronary imaging using intravascular ultrasound was performed, and atherosclerotic plaque lesions were observed (). Two drug-eluting stents were deployed (Synergy 2.75/28 mm and Synergy 2.25/20 mm), and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 3 flow was achieved (). The creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB peaked at 2034 and 278 IU/L (normal values: CK 60\u2013287 IU/L and CK-MB <25 IU/L) 8 h after the admission.\nFollowing treatment of ACS, we began treatment for PE with an oral anticoagulant (OAC, rivaroxaban 30 mg/day). He was relieved of his chest symptoms and was rescued from a hypoxic state. He was discharged on the 14th day after admission. Enhanced SDCT and associated reconstructed images of effective atomic number (Z-effective) 6 months after the treatment started, until when dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC therapy (rivaroxaban 30 mg/day for 3 weeks and 15 mg/day after 3 weeks) were continued, showed improvement in perfusion defects in both pulmonary fields () and the myocardium (). His treatment was deescalated to single antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg/day) and OAC, and he has had a good course without recurrence.

    "question": "A 54-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with subacute cough for the last month. The patient had a history of multilobar (right middle lobe and right upper lobe) pneumonia over the past 2 years, and had been admitted to a nearby hospital with the chief complaint of a cough that had worsened over the previous month. She usually had a dry cough after a cold, which did not last for more than 2 months. Following a diagnosis of acute eosinophilic bronchitis and focal pneumonia, the patient was administered antibiotics. However, her pneumonia did not improve and she was transferred to our hospital for further examination.\nShe had no disease and no operation history. She was nonsmoker and social drinker. She had no family history and her occupation was teacher.\nBlood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg, pulse rate was 60 beats per minute, respiration rate was 20 per minute, and body temperature was 36.8\u2103. General findings indicated no pain, but chest auscultation revealed minor rales in the right middle lobe. Heart auscultation revealed a normal beat without cardiac murmur. No edema was observed in the abdomen or extremities, and no lymph node enlargement was apparent.\nThe results of an arterial blood gas examination performed at the time of admission were PH 7.43, PaCO2 33 mm Hg, PaO2 78 mm Hg, and HCO3- 22 mEq/L. A peripheral blood examination revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 44%, a white blood cell count of 8,600/mm3, and a platelet count of 250,000/mm3.\nThe results of biochemical analysis were a total protein level of 6.8 g/dL, albumin 4.1 g/dL, aspirate aminotransferase 38 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 200 mg/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 m/hr, blood urea nitrogen 12.9 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. Electrolytes and blood glucose levels were normal, and urine examination revealed specific gravity of 1.025, pH 6.0, no proteinuria, and a red blood cell count of 30-49 per high-power field. Subsequent examination revealed no worsening of hematuria. Empirical antibiotic treatment, acid-fast bacillus (AFB) sputum smear, and sputum eosinophil tests were performed, in order to differentiate community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Sputum bacteria examination did not yield specific findings, and very few sputum eosinophils were observed. The concentration of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen detected was 1.3 ng/mL(with-in normal range), and an interferon-gamma release assay was positive. However, the AFB smear and TB polymerase chain reaction were negative, and AFB culture yielded no-growth. Tests for rheumatic factors and antinuclear antibody yielded no specific findings, and the patient did not complain of rheumatic-disease-related symptoms. Electrocardiography and echocardiography yielded normal results, and pulmonary function examination revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.83 L (90% of reference), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) 2.27 L (93% of reference), FEV1/FVC 92%, and diffusion capacity adjusted by the alveolar volume 97%, indicating mild obstructive ventilation disturbance.\nSimple chest radiography revealed nodular lesions around the pulmonary hilum of the right upper lobe (). Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 1.8-cm speculated nodule around the inferior margin of the right upper lobe, and the differential diagnosis of focal pneumonia or lung cancer was required (). A bronchoscopy revealed no abnormalities in the bronchi. Kidney ultrasonography and a gastroscopy that were performed to confirm the amyloidosis lesions did not yield specific findings; so video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)-assisted pulmonary wedge resection was conducted for early differentiation of lung cancer. No surgical complications were encountered.\nHistology indicated a thickened interstitium due to eosinophilic amorphous material deposits, with some giant cells and histiocyte infiltration (). Congo red staining for amyloidosis was positive, and under a polarized microscope the nodule exhibited a unique apple-green birefringence ().\nAdditional examinations for amyloidosis, blood and urine immunoelectrophoresis, and immunofixation were performed. IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgD concentrations were normal, as were the immunofixation results (). A bone marrow biopsy was not performed, in accordance with the patient's request.

    "question": "A 32-year-old female with a past medical history of obesity (body mass index of 42) and gastroesophageal reflux disease, not on home medications, presented to the emergency department complaining of worsening shortness of breath for two days. The patient was in her usual state of health until seven days before presentation, when she developed a dry cough, fever, chills, and malaise. She worked as a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home facility where a few cases of COVID-19 had been detected recently.\nIn the emergency department, her initial vital signs were as follows: temperature 99\u00b0F, pulse 106 beats per minute, blood pressure 107/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 70% on room air. Physical examination revealed an alert and oriented patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 15), with bilateral wheezing but otherwise unremarkable physical findings. She was promptly placed on nasal cannula and subsequently on nonrebreather 100% FiO2, with an improvement of her oxygen saturation to 95%.\nHer initial laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/\u00b5L (normal range [NR] 3.8-10.8 K/\u00b5L), absolute lymphocyte count of 0.64 K/\u00b5L (NR 0.85-3.9 K/\u00b5L), hemoglobin 14.1 g/dL (NR 13.2-17.1 g/dL), platelets 214 K/\u00b5L (NR 140-400 K/\u00b5L), C-reactive protein 30.94 mg/dL (NR < 0.80 mg/dL), ferritin 998 \u00b5g/L, lactic acid 3.3 mmol/L (NR 0.5-2.2 mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase 556 U/L (NR 125-220 U/L), troponin was negative (NR < 0.30 ng/mL), creatinine 1.0 mg/dL (NR 0.7-1.3 mg/dL), Na 138 mmol/L (NR 135-145 mmol/L), K 3.4 mmol/L (NR 3.5-5.1 mmol/L), and high-sensitivity D-dimer 806 ng/mL (NR < 231 ng/mL).\nThe chest radiograph obtained in the emergency department demonstrated multiple rounded and peripheral ground-glass opacities throughout the lung fields (Figure ).\nA nasopharyngeal swab was performed and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Due to severe hypoxia, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). On hospital day 2, she underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation for worsening tachypnea and respiratory distress. The patient was started on intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg every eight hours), received a dose of tocilizumab 400 mg, and completed a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine (800 mg/day for one day, then 400 mg/day for four days) and azithromycin (500 mg/day for one day, then 250 mg/day for four days).\nOn hospital day 3, her renal function worsened, and her creatinine peaked at 2.4 mg/dL, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis. However, she remained with good urine output and no significant metabolic acidosis. Her creatinine gradually improved on the subsequent days, returning to the baseline renal function. The patient remained stable hemodynamically and sedated with hydromorphone and ketamine, but despite the optimized medical management she continued to spike fevers at 102\u00b0F, and repeated chest imaging with CT on day 5 showed significant worsening bilateral ground-glass airspace opacities (Figure ).\nOn hospital day 7, she received convalescent plasma transfusion and started on vancomycin after respiratory cultures demonstrated the presence of Staphylococcus aureus infection. On hospital day 8, the patient had an episode of oxygen desaturation to 75% with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 79, despite being on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 12 cm H2O. She was bagged by the respiratory therapist for over one hour and given the failure of mechanical ventilation to provide adequate oxygenation, the decision was to start VV-ECMO.\nThe patient\u2019s left femoral vein was cannulated with a 28-Fr heparin-coated cannula for blood return and the left internal jugular vein was cannulated with a 21-Fr cannula for blood access. The patient was placed on VV-ECMO (CentriMag [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA] short-term external circulatory device) with initial settings of flow 4.5 liters per minute, speed 3,300 revolutions per minute, and ECMO FiO2 100%, sweep three liters per minute. She was started on heparin drip, received infusion of neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for a short period, and then remained sedated with hydromorphone and lorazepam. She continued to have episodes of fevers up to 101\u00b0F, and repeated sputum cultures demonstrated the presence of Acinetobacter species and Proteus mirabilis, while blood cultures were negative. She was placed on cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia and the episodes of fevers gradually improved.\nOn the following two weeks, the patient was gradually able to wean down VV-ECMO settings, decreasing ECMO FiO2 to 40%, and flow to 3.6 liters per minute. On hospital day 20, she had a transvenous pacemaker placed due to several episodes of bradycardia with pauses lasting up to 19 seconds during oral care, likely vagally mediated. On hospital day 21, a bronchoscopy was performed and showed minimal secretions and no mucus plug. Given her prolonged time intubated, she underwent tracheostomy placement on hospital day 22. On hospital day 26, the patient was finally able to have VV-ECMO explanted, after 18 days of extracorporeal therapy. As she continued to improve clinically, the mechanical ventilation was successfully weaned off on hospital day 38. The patient was noted to have no neurological deficits, and was able to be downgraded from ICU to the medical ward on the following day. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presented to the emergency room with complaints of lightheadedness, dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and bilateral lower extremity oedema over the course of a few weeks. His symptoms were associated with chest discomfort and he denied similar past episodes. He had no significant past medical history. Family history was remarkable for a brother diagnosed with BTHS by genetic testing. The patient denied alcohol use and recreational drug use. He endorsed active cigarette smoking (0.33 packs per day). On presentation, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.7\u00b0C, hypotensive to 86/54 mmHg, tachycardic to 104 beats per minute (b.p.m.), breathing at a rate of 18 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination was remarkable for diminished breath sounds at the lung bases bilaterally, tachycardia with regular rhythm, jugular venous distension to the earlobe, and 2+ pitting oedema in the lower extremities bilaterally. Complete blood count revealed leukopenia (2.9 k/\u03bcL; reference range: 4.0\u201310.8 k/\u03bcL), neutropenia (27.7%; reference range: 43.0\u201375.0%), and monocytosis (37.1%; reference range: 3.0\u201312.0%). Lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 91 mg/dL (reference range: 120\u2013200 mg/dL), with a calculated LDL of 44 mg/dL (reference range: 0\u201399 mg/dL), and an HDL of 22 mg/dL (reference range: 40\u201359 mg/dL). Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 128 b.p.m., criteria for left atrial enlargement, and a prolonged QTc interval of 589 ms (). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation, diagnostic interventions, and treatment. Echocardiographic exam revealed enlargement of all four chambers ( and Video 1), with significant dilatation of the left ventricle (end-diastolic diameter 6.0 cm, end-systolic diameter 5.8 cm) and severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15\u201320%. Additionally, mild pulmonary hypertension was present. Ischaemic workup with coronary angiography revealed patent vessels ( and Video 2), and ventriculogram showed an LVEF of 20%. Right heart catheterization was remarkable for pulmonary arterial pressure of 26/11 mmHg (mean of 16 mmHg), a calculated Fick cardiac output of 3.18 L/min (normal range: 4\u20138 L/min) and a cardiac index of 2.02 L/min/m2 (normal range 2.5\u20134 L/min/m2). HIV testing was negative, ethanol level was within normal limits, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was mildly elevated at 5.12 \u03bcIU/mL (reference range: 0.4\u20134.0 \u03bcIU/mL), with free T4 within normal limits at 1.16 ng/dL. Based on the history of present illness, family history, physical examination findings, laboratory investigations, and diagnostic imaging results, the patient could likely have a diagnosis of BTHS. He was carefully diuresed to euvolemia, discharged in stable condition with a LifeVest wearable defibrillator for 3 months, and furosemide 20 mg per orum (PO) daily. He was also started on guideline-directed medical therapy including carvedilol 3.125 mg PO twice a day and sacubitril-valsartan 24\u201326 mg PO twice a day. At a 6-month follow-up visit, the patient had no further complaints, remained compliant with his discharge medications, and spironolactone 12.5 mg PO daily was added. An outpatient cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study with and without contrast for evaluation of infiltrative disease and other causes of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy was non-suggestive of myocardial infarction, infiltrates, or other abnormal enhancement by late gadolinium enhancement imaging. The patient\u2019s diagnosis was confirmed with outpatient genetic testing for TAZ gene mutation, and he continued to regularly follow-up with an advanced heart failure cardiologist. A repeat echocardiogram (Video 3) 2 years after the initial hospitalization showed evidence of cardiac remodelling with improvement in left ventricular size (end-diastolic diameter 5.02 cm, end-systolic diameter 4.06 cm) and LVEF (45\u201350%).

    "question": "A 53-year-old Korean man who had undergone curative surgical resection for stage iii (T3N2M0) colon cancer was evaluated in clinic by his medical oncologist before the start of adjuvant chemotherapy. He appeared clinically well on assessment and proceeded to receive his first cycle of modified folfox-6 chemotherapy. This regimen consisted of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, folinic acid 400 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) 400 mg/m2 bolus on day 1, followed by 5-fu 2400 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over the next 46 hours. Dexamethasone 12 mg and ondansetron 8 mg were given as pre-medication before chemotherapy.\nThe patient experienced no acute side effects or complications in the chemotherapy unit. He was discharged home with an ambulatory 5-fu pump and was scheduled to return to the clinic at completion of his 5-fu infusion.\nTwenty-four hours later, the patient presented to the emergency department with new symptoms of erratic behaviour and confusion. Collateral history from the accompanying family members revealed that he had suffered a brief generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure earlier in the day, but no apparent history of head injuries, infectious symptoms, or recent alcohol intake was present. The patient\u2019s other medical problems included well-controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, polycystic kidney disease, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine: 172 mmol/L), and stable chronic hepatitis B carrier status without laboratory or radiologic evidence of cirrhosis. No history of epilepsy was present. The patient\u2019s only oral medications were amlodipine, quinapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. He was an ex-smoker, and he denied alcohol abuse and illicit drugs.\nOn examination in the emergency department, the patient was neither alert nor oriented. He was unable to follow commands, and his verbal responses were incomprehensible. He was agitated, and his limbs were tremulous at rest. Temperature was 35.9\u00b0C; heart rate, 82/min; respirations, 18/min; blood pressure, 130/84 mmHg; and O2 saturation on room air, 99%. The patient\u2019s eyes appeared deviated to his left side, but pupils were equal and reactive. Spontaneous twitching of the extremities, on the left side more than on the right, was noted and attributed to possible complex partial seizures. No other focal neurologic deficits or evidence of trauma were present. The Brudzinski and Kernig signs were negative. Examinations of chest, heart, and abdomen were otherwise unremarkable. The patient was noted to be incontinent of urine during the assessment. He was treated with intravenous diazepam and phenytoin (given in a loading dose of 1000 mg) for his agitation and presumed seizure activity respectively. At this point, his 5-fu infusion pump was still attached and functioning.\nLaboratory investigations showed leucocytosis (white blood cell count: 19.5 \u00d7 109/L) with left shift, but an otherwise normal complete blood cell count. Liver enzyme tests were within normal limits. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were elevated (239 mmol/L and 8.6 mmol/L respectively). Metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 29 mmol/L was present. Imaging of the head and brain by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan respectively did not demonstrate evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, mass, or other abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was benign, and subsequent cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine were all negative. Of note, serum ammonia, at 316 mmol/L, and serum lactate, at 8.3 mmol/L, were elevated. The remainder of the toxicology screen was completely unremarkable. Vitamin B12 level and thyroid function tests were normal. An electroencephalogram showed a generalized slowing pattern consistent with metabolic encephalopathy.\nOver the next 8 hours, the patient\u2019s mental status progressively deteriorated to a comatose state. The 5-fu infusion pump was discontinued. Because the patient was no longer adequately protecting his airway, the critical care team was consulted for patient intubation and admission to the intensive care unit. With an apparent cause for the rapidly progressive cognitive dysfunction still lacking, lactulose at a dose of 30 mL every 4 hours was administered by nasogastric tube shortly thereafter in an effort to correct the patient\u2019s encephalopathy. Phenytoin was continued.\nFollowing the cessation of 5-fu and administration of lactulose, the patient gradually recovered over the next 48 hours from his acute confusional state. He experienced significant fatigue and muscle weakness, but no further seizures. Successive ammonia levels showed a decreasing trend. The patient was extubated, and phenytoin was discontinued. This man was discharged home on day 8 with instructions to follow up with his medical oncologist the following week.\nAfter discharge, the patient required several weeks to recuperate before he could embark on additional chemotherapy. Considering his presumed neuropsychiatric complication from folfox chemotherapy, raltitrexed (3 mg/m2) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) were given every 3 weeks as adjuvant treatment instead. This therapy was provided on an inpatient basis because of the insistence of the patient. No significant adverse reactions were noted. Unfortunately, re-staging investigations shortly thereafter revealed three metastatic lesions in the liver. We plan to continue with further chemotherapy for this patient with the goal of potential resection of his liver lesions in the future. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 74-year-old male with a history of mild cognitive impairment presented to the emergency department with failure to thrive and generalized weakness of three weeks duration. He was having difficulty swallowing which he related to a poorly fitted denture. He had thirty pounds of unintentional weight loss in the last three months due to loss of appetite. His past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, major depressive disorder, chronic pain syndrome, and hepatitis C. His social history was significant for 12.5 pack-year smoking and drinking (two to three glasses of wine/day). He denied any utilization of recreational drugs. In the emergency department, his vital signs were, BP-104/59 mmHg, HR-97 bpm, respiratory rate-14/minute, temperature-97.4 \u00b0F, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He weighed 40 kg, and his BMI was 13.84 kg/m2. On physical examination, he was alert, oriented, and appeared weak and malnourished. The ill-fitted complete maxillary denture was removed. The oral cavity examination revealed a large (3 \u00d7 2 cm2) defect with an erythematous border that encompassed the mid-palatal structures and emanated from the hard palate into his nasal cavity (Figure ).\nThere was no discrete mass or ulcer and mucosa surrounding this defect appeared normal. On palpation, the lesion was non-tender without any palpable lymph node on the head and neck examination. His lungs, heart, neurological, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory data at admission showed Hb-11.7 g/dl, WBC\u2019s-9.6 K/CMM, and platelets-190 K/CMM. The chemistry panel (BMP) was within the normal range. AST-23 U/L, ALT-25 U/L, and serum alkaline phosphatase were 114 U/L. Auto-immune work-up including anti-dsDNA, anti-proteinase-3 antibodies, myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies were negative. The patient was managed conservatively, with nutritional supplementation and supportive care. Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck demonstrates enlarged level 2A lymph nodes bilaterally (Figure and 2B), corresponding to increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity on PET CT (Figure ).\nA biopsy of the palatal lesion was performed, which showed SCC (well-differentiated), with parakeratosis, acute, and chronic inflammation (Figure ).\nImmunohistochemistry by p16 shows diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of well-differentiated SCC (Figure ). PD-L1 test showed a combined positive score of 10-15. CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis were negative for metastasis. NM bone scan showed radiotracer uptake in paranasal sinuses/facial bones. PET scan showed diffuse FDG activity in the hard palate, mildly hypermetabolic cervical, pretracheal, subcarinal, and left hilar nodes with minimal FDG activity. A diagnosis of locally advanced (stage IVa) oral cavity SCC was made. The patient was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including an oncologist, head and neck surgeon, maxillofacial surgeon, radiation oncologist, and nutritionist for further management. The patient underwent prosthetic rehabilitation. A palatal obturator (prosthesis) was placed to improve his speech, eating, and prevent regurgitation. The patient opted for palliative care and did not want to pursue further treatment. He was discharged home. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "The patient was a Japanese 72-year-old man, who had been diagnosed with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) in 2014. He was an ex-smoker who did not regularly consume alcohol. In September 2015, treatment with oral cytarabine ocfosfate hydrate was initiated. After four cycles, he developed pneumonia, and treatment was terminated in February 2016. In April 2016, although he had no complaints, his serum C-reactive protein level was found to have re-increased to 4.6 mg/dL, and a chest X-ray and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed scattered small nodular shadows and patchy consolidation (Figure A,B). The radiological findings did not improve despite the administration of antibiotics and antifungal drugs.\nWe performed bronchoscopy in May 2016. Bronchoalveolar lavage performed in the right upper lobe recovered 90 mL of 150 mL (60%) with 1.3 \u00d7 105/mL cells (neutrophils: 26%, lymphocytes: 36%, eosinophils: 1%, and macrophages: 37%). The histological examination of a specimen obtained from the right upper lobe via transbronchial lung biopsy revealed findings consistent with OP (Figure A). On immunofluorescence testing, the patient's antinuclear antibody titer was <40, and no other autoantibodies, including anti-SS-A, anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, were detected. We diagnosed the patient with secondary OP associated with aCML. Treatment with prednisolone (30 mg, daily) was initiated, which resulted in the improvement of the laboratory and radiological findings, and the dose of prednisolone was then gradually tapered (Figure ). In September 2016, the patient developed general fatigue while under treatment with prednisolone (17.5 mg, daily). Chest CT revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs). We considered the possibility of a recurrence of OP, and therefore increased the dose of prednisolone to 30 mg, daily; however, the patient's condition did not improve.\nThe patient was admitted to our hospital due to dyspnea on effort in November 2016. On admission, a physical examination revealed the following findings: respiratory rate, 15 breaths per minute; heart rate, 80 beats per minute; blood pressure, 106/60 mm Hg; and body temperature, 37.3\u00b0C. Chest auscultation revealed no abnormalities.\nThe laboratory tests performed on admission included an arterial blood gas analysis under ambient air, which showed the following findings: partial pressure of oxygen, 60.3 Torr; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 30.4 Torr; and pH, 7.446. A blood analysis revealed the following findings: white blood cell count, 41 900/\u03bcL (neutrophil, 88.0%; lymphocytes, 5.0%; monocytes, 2.0%; promyelocytes, 1.0%; and myelocytes, 3.0%; metacytes, 1.0%); hemoglobin, 7.8 g/dL; platelet count, 34.2 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL; lactate dehydrogenase, 564 IU/L, Krebs von den Lugen-6, 2826 U/mL; and carcinoembryonic antigen, 15.6 ng/mL. The patient was negative for \u03b2-D glucan and cytomegalovirus antigen. HRCT showed diffuse GGOs in both lung fields (Figure C,D).\nOn the following day, we performed bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage in the right middle lobe. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed a light milky appearance (Figure B) and was periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive. Transbronchial lung biopsy revealed the precipitation of dense, homogenous, eosinophilic material, which had a fine granular appearance, and which filled the alveoli (Figure C); however, no evidence of OP was found. Based on these findings, he was diagnosed with PAP. Although the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibody level was not measured, the diagnosis of sPAP was confirmed by compatible radiological findings and a pre-existing diagnosis of aCML.,\nHe gradually developed respiratory failure with the progression of PAP; whole-lung lavage was subsequently performed. Unfortunately, the patient died of acute enteritis within 1 month of whole-lung lavage. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 60-year-old man was referred to our hospital for raised serum creatinine. The patient had abdominal pain for 15 days, which was mild, vague and non-radiating. It was followed by bilateral pedal edema in a day and in next three days followed by sudden onset bilateral foot drop with numbness. Patient gave history of nausea, vomiting, skin rash, anorexia and malaise since 20 days. He had weight loss of 10 kg in last 20 days. The past medical history was unremarkable. Alcohol consumption and drug abuse were absent. On physical examination, temperature was 38.4\u00b0C, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate 84/min and respiratory rate 20/min. Pedal edema was pitting, bilateral. Macular skin rashes around both ankles were present. Testicular tenderness was present. There was sensory and motor involvement in bilateral tibia and peroneal nerve distribution. Funduscopic examination showed grade 3 hypertensive retinopathy. Laboratory examination revealed a hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dl, white blood cell count of 24000/\u00b5l, platelet count of 485000/\u00b5l. Serum creatinine was 2.4 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 102 mg/dl, potassium 5.0 mEq/l, albumin 3.1 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 27 U/l, alanine aminotransferase 20 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 131 U/l and total cholesterol 198 mg/dl. Prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times were normal. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria, with two to three oval fat bodies per high-power field. Protein excretion was 3.4 g/day. Bence jones proteinuria, urine immunoelectrophoresis showed non selective proteinuria. On admission, HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HBc IgM were positive. Anti-HBs, anti-HBe, anti-HCV and anti-HIV were negative. Serum HBV-DNA level (PCR) was 582917 copies/ml. ANA, anti-dsDNA, RF, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, and cryoglobulins were negative. Serum C3 and C4 complement levels were normal. Chest x-ray and electrocardiography were normal. The nerve conduction study was compatible with axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy in bilateral lower limbs. A kidney biopsy was performed due to nephrotic range proteinuria and revealed membranous nephropathy (MN). All glomeruli were mildly enlarged. Capillary lumina were open and lined by thickened membranes and there was spikes on the external side of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (Jones stain). Mild uniform matrix accentuation with normal cell distribution was noted. Tubules were moderately degenerated. Interstitial area was moderately prominent for edema with leucocyte infiltration. Immunofluorescence study, showed significant granular IgG deposition along the membranes of capillary in a diffuse pattern (). There was no immunofluorescent staining for fibrinogen, IgA, or IgM. Congo-red staining for amyloid was negative. A liver biopsy was not performed. Doppler study for renal vessels was normal and there were no microaneurysms characteristic of PAN. Prednisolone (60 mg/day), plasmapheresis (5courses) and entecavir (0.5 mg/ every second day) were started. At 2 months follow up, patient improved in the form of grade 3/5 power in both lower limbs with sensory improvement. Twenty-four hours proteinuria decreased to 800 mg/day and serum creatinine was 1.5 mg/dl with no pedal edema. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 21-year-old female patient with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with presyncope. Three weeks prior to her presentation, she tested positive for COVID-19 infection after developing symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain. She was quarantined at her home and treated symptomatically with improvement. She never required hospitalization for her symptoms nor medications. She denied smoking and alcohol or illicit drug use along with any other medication that could cause QT interval prolongation. Upon her presentation, her physical examination was noted to be significant for bradycardia. Her vitals were blood pressure of 118/63 mmHg, a heart rate of 45 bpm, a temperature of 98.3 \u00b0F, and a respiratory rate of 18 sating 100% on room air. Her electrocardiogram showed 45 bpm with narrow QRS complex and premature atrial complexes.\nSignificant laboratory results included a WBC of 18.24 k/\u03bcL (3.60\u20139.50), troponin negative at <0.03 ng/mL (\u22640.04), normal TSH at 3.79 uIU/mL (0.34\u20135.60), CRP at 27.00 mg/L (\u226410.00), ESR at 51 mm/h (0\u201320), procalcitonin at <0.02 ng/mL (0.00\u20130.10), a COVID-19 PCR positive, BNP at 160 pg/mL (\u2264100), lactate at 1.2 mmol/L (0.5\u20132.2), and a negative urine drug screen. The chest X-ray showed no acute events. The transthoracic echocardiogram was normal with an EF of 60%. The patient was walked on treadmill and her junctional heart rhythm increased to 91 bpm; she was given 1 mg of atropine IV over a period of 5 min, in which her sinus rate increased to >100 bpm. Given the improvement in the patient\u2019s symptoms, there was no indication for a dual chamber pacemaker. Hence, she was started on theophylline 200 mg oral dose daily with follow up within 1 week at the clinic (A,B). Upon her follow up, she had a heart rate of 90 bpm while on theophylline and no side effects were reported. Later, at her 5-week follow up visit, a complete resolution of her symptoms was reported and theophylline use was discontinued. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 6-year-old girl (height 110 cm, weight 20.3 kg) with no medical history had a fever 1 month before surgery. She visited a clinic and general hospital due to jaundice and malaise. At admission to the general hospital 2 weeks before surgery, she was diagnosed with acute hepatitis and was given liver protection drugs (Stronger Neo-Minophagen C, Lactulose, Vitamin K) and fresh frozen plasma, although her liver and coagulation function deteriorated during the course of treatment, along with decrease in platelet count. She was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of our children's medical center for blood purification therapy 4 days before surgery.\nOn examination, she looked ill. Physical examination revealed the following: blood pressure 95/56 mm Hg, pulse rate 72 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min with SpO2 of 99% on room air, body temperature 37.3 \u00b0C, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of E3V4M6. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, with no hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the eyes and skin revealed icterus.\nInitial laboratory investigations revealed thrombocytopenia (hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, white cell count 3.4 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, platelet count 9.1 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL). Electrolytes were normal (Na 139 mmol/L, K 4.2 mmol/L, Cl 103 mmol/L, Ca 9.5 mg/dL, Mg 2.3 mg/dL, P 3.9 mg/dL). Her coagulation profile was prolonged (prothrombin time 23%, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio 2.36, activated partial thromboplastin time 63.7 s) and liver function tests were abnormal (albumin 4.0 g/dL, total bilirubin 18.76 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 13.17 mg/dL, venous ammonia 70 \u03bcg/dL, lactate 2.2 mmol/L). Infectious disease screening tests were negative. Computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen showed lower absorption in the liver compared to the spleen, suggesting ALF. Cranial CT scan and fundus examination were normal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow spindle waves with a frequency of 1\u20132 Hz, without laterality or triphasic waves (Fig. a). Daily plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration were started for ALF with HE. Mannitol was administered to prevent cerebral edema. A day before surgery, GCS scores worsened to E1VTM1. Clinically, she was unresponsive to pain and auditory stimuli, and her EEG showed high voltage continuous slow waves with a frequency of 0.5\u20131 Hz, without lateralization (Fig. b). Assuming deterioration of HE, emergency LT was considered vital. After obtaining informed consent from her family, urgent living donor LT with an extended left liver graft from her mother was planned on the 5th ICU day.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (50 mcg) and rocuronium (20 mg) and maintained with remifentanil and rocuronium infusions (0.1\u20130.4 mcg/kg/min and 7 mcg/kg/min, respectively), along with sevoflurane inhalation at 0.5%. A BIS Quatro Brain Monitoring Sensor (Medtronic plc, Dublin, Ireland) was placed on the frontotemporal region, and her electroencephalogram, including BIS values, 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95), and suppression ratio (SR), was continuously recorded at each phase of liver transplantation by the BIS monitor until the end of anesthesia (Fig. , Fig. a\u2013d). The durations of anesthesia and surgery were 708 min and 637 min, respectively. The graft volume was 254 g, graft volume/recipient standard liver volume (GV/SLV) was 46.1%, and graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) was 1.27%. Warm and cold ischemia times were 40 min and 51 min, respectively. BIS values ranged from 10 to 20 from the start of the operation to reperfusion (Fig. ). From reperfusion to the end of the operation, BIS values ranged from 10 to 80, and the variation in BIS values also increased. The frequency of EEG waveforms and BIS values seen with BIS monitoring gradually increased (Fig. ). She was re-admitted to the PICU after surgery, extubated on postoperative day (POD) 2 and discharged from the PICU on POD 7. Follow-up EEG on POD 5 showed low amplitude and fast waves with a frequency of 9\u201310 Hz, without laterality or paroxysmal waves (Fig. c). However, she spoke only a few words until POD 7. Two weeks postoperatively, she was newly diagnosed with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. Her immunosuppressant regimen was changed and continued for post liver transplantation prophylaxis and aplastic anemia. She was discharged after 4 months of hospitalization. The cause of liver failure in the present case remains unknown. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Japanese man without a remarkable medical history visited our hospital with chief complaints of fever, fatigue, generalized edema, and abdominal distention. His fever started two weeks prior to admission. Abdominal distention and edema gradually worsened, and he gained 7 kg of weight within two weeks, despite low food intake owing to loss of appetite. He denied previous episodes of infectious diseases. At initial presentation, he appeared exhausted. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.8 \u00b0C; blood pressure, 160/93 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min; respiratory rate, 22 breathes/min; and oxygen saturation, 90% with room air. On physical examination, generalized pitting edema was observed. His heart sounds were normal, but his lung sounds were weak at the lung base on both sides. Jaundice was not observed, but a distended abdomen and hepatomegaly were observed. Blood test results on the day of admission revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (14,600/\u03bcL), mild anemia (hemoglobin level, 11.1 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 11.1 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL), renal impairment (blood urea nitrogen level, 60.7 mg/dL and serum creatinine level, 2.94 mg/dL), an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (14.25 mg/dL), an elevated ALP level (768 U/L), polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (immunoglobulin G [IgG], 2461 mg/dL), and an elevated IgG4 level (235 mg/dL). Immunological screening test results for autoantibodies were negative, except for positive antinuclear antibody (\u00d7 40) and anti-SS-A antibody. Polymerase chain reaction for HHV-8 DNA in a serum sample was negative (Table ). Computed tomography (CT) performed on the day of admission revealed massive pleural effusions and ascites, generalized mild lymphadenopathy (< 1.5 cm in diameter), and hepatosplenomegaly (Fig. ). Echocardiography performed on day 2 revealed normal wall motions without any sign of valvular disease, but a collapsed inferior vena cava was observed (maximum diameter < 5 mm). 18F\u2013fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed no apparent FDG uptake, except for slight uptake in the para-aortic lymph nodes (Fig. ). Considering the positive anti-SS-A antibody finding, lip biopsy was performed on day 6, but the pathological findings did not meet the criteria for Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (SjS). On ophthalmological examination, keratoconjunctivitis was not observed; however, bilateral optic edema was remarkable (Fig. ). Serum IL-6 and plasma VEGF levels were assessed in a blood sample obtained on day 9, and both were elevated (25.2 pg/mL and 224 pg/mL, respectively). Abdominal paracentesis was performed on the same day, and the levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ascites were remarkably high (3310 pg/mL and 335 pg/mL, respectively). Bone marrow examination was performed on day 9. Bone marrow aspiration was dry tap, and bone marrow biopsy revealed a mild increase in megakaryocytes and mild reticulin myelofibrosis on silver impregnation staining (Fig. ). Biopsy of a cervical lymph node was performed on day 10, and the pathological findings were compatible with a mixed-type MCD histology (Fig. ). We suspected TAFRO syndrome and methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy (500 mg/day for three consecutive days) was initiated on day 10 after lymph node biopsy, followed by intravenous PSL (40 mg/day) and oral CsA administration. The disease severity of TAFRO syndrome one day prior to treatment initiation was very severe (grade 5) []. After the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment, the patient became afebrile and the CRP level returned to the normal range within two weeks. However, the patient\u2019s platelet count and serum creatinine level as well as his overall condition did not improve, even after the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment (Fig. ). A central venous catheter was inserted and total parenteral nutrition was started as he could not eat owing to loss of appetite and refusal of tubal feeding. Diuretics, including furosemide, potassium canrenoate, trichlormethiazide, and tolvaptan were administered during hospitalization; however, the amount of ascites did not decrease (Fig. ). Urinalysis performed on day 25 revealed mild proteinuria (0.34 g/day) with a fractional excretion of sodium of 5.1% and a fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FEUN) of 20.7%. Because urinalysis was performed under diuretics use, considering FEUN level and intravascular hypovolemia on echography, intravenous fluid replacement was performed to correct the pre-renal factor responsible for renal impairment. However, the patient\u2019s volume depletion and blood pressure did not respond well to intravenous fluid replacement. Abdominal paracentesis was again performed on day 40, and it revealed persistently high levels of IL-6 and VEGF (4320 pg/mL and 421 pg/mL, respectively). Although urine volume was initially preserved with diuretic administration, the patient became oliguric from day 47 and anuric from day 49. He was hemodynamically unstable on day 50 (body temperature, 37.5 \u00b0C; blood pressure, 84/52 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; oxygen saturation, 95% with room air). As the patient was undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and his CRP levels increased by 10.08 mg/dL on the same day, systemic examination was performed to rule out the possibility of infectious disease. Analysis of ascites was performed on the same day, revealing purulent ascites, and Escherichia coli was isolated. E. coli was also isolated from blood cultures. CT of the chest showed a mass in the right lung (Fig. ) in addition to scattered appearance of high intensity regions in the myocardium, which were newly observed (Fig. ). Blood tests performed on day 50 revealed elevated \u03b2-d-glucan levels (23.0 pg/mL) and positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia (41 cells/5 \u00d7 104 WBCs on the C7-HRP test). Aspergillus, Candida mannan, and Cryptococcus neoformans antigens were negative. We suspected bacterial peritonitis and fungal pneumonia. Intravenous meropenem, vancomycin, and caspofungin were initiated on the same day. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) using a polymethyl-methacrylate membrane was also initiated on the same day because anuria did not improve and the patient was hemodynamically unstable. Conditions of CRRT were as follows: mode, continuous hemodiafiltration; dialysis membrane, CH-1.8 W (Toray Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo Japan); and anticoagulant, nafamostat mesilate. The blood, dialysate, substitute, and filtration flow rates were 100 mL/min, 400 mL/h, 400 mL/h, and 800 mL/h, respectively.\nHowever, approximately 10 h after CRRT initiation, cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation followed by pulseless electrical activity) suddenly occurred. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved by cardiopulmonary resuscitation with epinephrine injections. STEMI was suspected from electrocardiography findings obtained immediately after ROSC (Fig. ). Echocardiography performed immediately after ROSC revealed a generalized hypokinesis and akinesia of the anterior wall, septum, and apex without any apparent calcification of the cardiac wall. Blood tests performed after ROSC revealed a slightly elevated serum creatine kinase-MB level (80 U/L, normal range: < 25 U/L) and a remarkably elevated troponin I level (1.2904 ng/mL, normal range: < 0.0262 ng/mL), indicating the acute phase of MI. Emergent coronary angiography (CAG) was performed on the same day. On CAG, complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was observed, and reperfusion was achieved through percutaneous old balloon angioplasty (Fig. ). An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted to increase coronary blood flow and improve cardiogenic shock. However, even after successful coronary intervention, the patient was still hemodynamically unstable. Despite intensive care, the patient died on day 52.\nAutopsy was performed after obtaining consent from the patient\u2019s relatives. The histological findings of autopsy are shown in Fig. . In this case, multiple infections, including bacterial peritonitis (small abscesses were observed in the abdominal space, and gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods were identified), systemic CMV infection (including the lungs, pancreas, and adrenal glands), and Trichosporon asahii infection in the lungs (T. asahii was isolated from sputum culture) were observed. Intravascular invasion of fungal hyphae was noted in the lungs. On histological evaluation of the heart, coagulation necrosis and neutrophil infiltration were observed, findings that were compatible with MI that occurred a few days before the autopsy. Considering that intravascular invasion of fungal hyphae was observed, embolization caused by fungal hyphae was a possible cause of MI in this case. Necrotic changes were observed in most internal organs. We considered multiple organ failure due to multiple severe infections and circulatory failure due to MI as the main causes of death in this patient. Although there was no stenotic lesion and vascular calcification was not apparent in the left anterior descending coronary artery, myocardial calcification was noted. Calcification in the skeletal muscle cells of the diaphragm and iliopsoas muscle without vascular calcification was also noted. The pathological findings of the kidney were compatible with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and endothelial injury was noted, although fibrin thrombi were not observed in arterioles. IgA, IgG, and IgM were negative on immunofluorescence. Tubulointerstitial changes could not be evaluated because most of the tissue was necrotic due to changes after death and circulatory failure prior to death. In the bone marrow reevaluation, the number of megakaryocytes did not increase, and reticulin myelofibrosis was not remarkably changed. In the lymph node reevaluation, infiltration of plasma cells was decreased, and immunosuppressive therapy appeared partially effective, although the amount of ascites and IL-6 levels in ascites did not decrease in the present case. Fibrotic changes in the fat tissue of the anterior mediastinum were noted. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "An 81-year-old woman was referred to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal discharge that had lasted for 4 days. Medical history included right nephrectomy for a renal stone 21 years earlier and medication for arterial hypertension 4 years earlier. The pain was localized to the lower abdomen without aggravating factors. Upon admission to the department of gynecology, the patient looked ill and had a temperature of 37.4\u2103, a blood pressure of 134/59 mmHg, a pulse of 77 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. The abdomen was slightly distended and tender over the lower abdomen, without signs of generalized peritoneal irritation. Pelvic examination showed an atrophied vagina and cervix, and a yellowish foul odorous vaginal discharge from the cervical os. Laboratory test results were within normal limits, except for a white blood cell count of 27,580/\u00b5L and a neutrophil fraction of 88.3%. Culture of the vaginal discharge revealed Escherichia coli and Enterococcus avium. Endovaginal sonography showed fluid collection measuring 2.7 \u00d7 2.4 cm in the endometrium, suggesting a pyometrium. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) showed a myometrial abscess cavity in the uterus and diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Tomography also showed that the uterine had joined to the thick sigmoid wall (). However, no definite fistula tract was visible. A colouterine fistula caused by diverticulitis was suspected. Therefore, fistulography was performed. When contrast fluid was injected through the cervical os, spillage of the contrast fluid into the sigmoid colon via the left side of the abscess cavity of the uterine fundus was observed (). On colonoscopy, multiple diverticula were noted at the sigmoid colon, and a suspected lesion of the fistula opening with surrounding edema and emission of air bubbles was detected approximately 25 cm from the anal verge (). The patient was diagnosed with a colouterine fistula caused by diverticulitis and was transferred to the department of surgery for a collaborative operation.\nDuring the operation, inflammatory adhesion of the distal sigmoid colon to the posterior wall of the uterus was found (). The colon was dissected off the uterus, and a fistula between the sigmoid colon and the endometrial cavity was identified. Primary resection of the sigmoid colon, including the affected segment, with anastomosis and repair of the fistula tract of the uterus were performed. The intrauterine purulent content was drained through the cervical os. In terms of gross appearance, the excised portion showed a fistula tract in the colonic wall (). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the ninth postoperative day. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 65-year-old African American female with past medical history significant for noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic back pain, morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) was 41), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), uterine fibroids, generalized anxiety disorder, and former tobacco abuse presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of generalized abdominal pain of 3 weeks' duration with intermittent diarrhea and constipation. Upon review of systems, she complained of atypical chest pain which was pleuritic and reproducible on palpation. The chest pain was nonexertional but she had exertional dyspnea. Of note, she had no prior history of cardiovascular disease.\nPast surgical history was remarkable for cesarean section and hysterectomy. Prior to admission medications included metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, ranitidine, and acetaminophen. Family history was remarkable for diabetes. In terms of social history, she was a former tobacco smoker, drank alcohol socially, and denied illicit drug use. She had a history of allergy to hydroxyzine, propoxyphene, and zomepirac.\nIn the ED, measurement of vital signs showed a temperature of 37.0\u00b0C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 148/82, and pulse oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Initial physical examination was normal except for obesity, depressed mood, chest wall tenderness, mild abdominal distention with tympanic note to percussion and mild generalized nonspecific tenderness to palpation. Rectal exam showed small nonbleeding external hemorrhoids. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were normal except for blood glucose of 240 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c was 9.3%. Troponin I was slightly elevated at 0.07 and it trended down on second measurement. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with new T-wave inversion in the inferolateral leads. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was only remarkable for fecal stasis in the rectum. Her abdominal pain and constipation was partially relieved after administration of IV morphine and senna-docusate.\nShe was also given aspirin for the chest pain. After her abdominal symptoms moderately improved, she was placed in the observation unit for cardiology consultation. After evaluation by the cardiologist, she was admitted to a telemetry unit for an inpatient cardiac stress test. She was receiving 81 mg aspirin daily. On day 2 of hospital admission, she underwent myocardial perfusion scan using the standard 0.4 mg regadenoson (LEXISCAN) injection. The stress test showed reversible perfusion defect involving the apex and lateral wall of the left ventricle, suggesting myocardial ischemia. At that time, clopidogrel (Plavix) was added to aspirin and the patient was started on IV heparin per ACS protocol pending cardiac catheterization. On day 4, coronary angiography was performed and it showed no significant occlusive coronary artery disease (CAD). During the catheterization procedure, the patient received IV heparin and IV nitroglycerin in addition to midazolam for sedation and fentanyl for analgesia. The radio contrast used was iohexol (OMNIPAQUE 350). Post-procedure, IV heparin was discontinued while DAPT with aspirin and Plavix were resumed.\nAfter recovery from sedation, the patient complained of a headache which got progressively worse within a few hours. It did not improve with repeated doses of oral hydrocodone and oral/IV acetaminophen. After around 12 hours of cardiac catheterization, the patient developed acute left-sided ptosis, deviated gaze (down and outward palsy), and anisocoria with left pupillary dilation (mydriasis) consistent with acute left 3rd nerve palsy (). The patient did not complain of decreased vision and visual field testing by confrontation was normal. She had no other sensory or motor deficits. Her mental status examination did not show evidence of confusion. Her vital signs were normal. STAT CT head without contrast (per stroke protocol) was read as negative for acute intracranial process. CTA of the head and neck was negative for arterial stenosis or aneurysms. The next day, MRI head and orbit with and without contrast were done using Gadodiamide as the MRI contrast agent. The MRI report, as read in our hospital, indicated a nonenhancing heterogeneous pituitary mass measuring 1.9 \u00d7 2.0 cm in the greatest dimension and slightly compressing on the optic chiasm suggestive of pituitary macroadenoma (). There was no report of any bleed/infarction by either CT or MRI report.\nA multidisciplinary team approach was undertaken with involvement of neurology, endocrinology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology (ENT), and neurosurgery. A full ophthalmological examination was normal except for complete left 3rd nerve palsy and mild cataracts. Visual field testing was normal. Hormonal studies were ordered and the results were as shown in . Of note, prolactin was lower than normal, while adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was above the reference range. Both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were considered low given the patient's postmenopausal status. The patient had normal random cortisol and free T4 level. She did not receive any IV glucocorticoids. The next day after the third nerve palsy, the patient developed a mild fever at 37.9\u00b0C with mild neutrophilic leukocytosis (white blood cell count 14.2 K/UL). The patient was transferred to a neuro step-down unit for close observation. Her vital signs remained mostly normal. Subjectively, she neither had a progression of symptoms nor developed new symptoms. Her headache was controlled with oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen. Her full neurologic examination remained normal except for isolated complete left oculomotor palsy. Leukocytosis gradually normalized over several days.\nPituitary apoplexy was highly suspected as a cause of the third nerve palsy, but the diagnosis was challenged by the fact that our radiologist's interpretation of imaging did not mention bleed or cavernous sinus extension. The diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy of the third nerve from microvascular ischemia was contemplated but it was felt less likely because it is usually pupil-sparing []. Neurosurgery requested ENT help for trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection. ENT did not feel comfortable with the plan and recommended transfer to a higher level center. The patient and her family were involved in decision making. They were truthfully told that our medical center is not a high volume center for such pituitary cases and the patient might benefit from a transfer to a more experienced center. They chose to transfer and the patient was transferred by ambulance to an academic center of excellence on day 7 of presentation.\nThere, neuroradiologists read the images obtained at our hospital differently. The new CT scan report indicated increased attenuation of the sella turcica and in the suprasellar cistern at the site of the patient's pituitary mass, suggestive of possible hemorrhage within the tumor (). The new MRI report indicated that there was a sellar/suprasellar mass lesion which appeared to show central intrinsic T1 shortening and hypoenhancement with peripheral right-sided enhancement. There was mass effect on the optic chiasm superiorly. The lesion appeared to extend laterally into the left cavernous sinus with mild mass effect on the cavernous internal carotid artery. The overall hypoenhancing portion measured 2.1 \u00d7 1.9 \u00d7 1.3 cm (Figures and ).\nThe physicians in the other hospital decided to proceed with surgical intervention hoping to relieve the pressure on the third nerve. On day 9 of symptoms, the patient underwent successful trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection. Intraoperatively, the neurosurgeon reported a typical contused apoplectic adenoma. A frozen section biopsy report, as well as final pathology report, confirmed necrotic pituitary tumor with evidence of recent hemorrhage. The apoplectic adenoma was removed and the pituitary gland was left intact. Postoperatively, the laboratory assessment indicated central hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Vital signs were stable. No major sodium abnormalities were noted. The patient was started on oral hydrocortisone and levothyroxine. Otherwise, the immediate postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on day 11 of symptoms development. One-month follow-up at the neurosurgeon's office was remarkable for persistence of oculomotor palsy. A six-month follow-up is scheduled. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

Five months prior to admission, the patient had been treated for dental caries at a local hospital, and at that time examination revealed seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus. On admission, temperature was 39.0'C, pulse 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute and blood pressure 130/80 mmHg. Physical examination revealed oral thrush, consistent with findings of extensive esophageal candidiasis in endoscopic gastroduodenscopy performed five days before admission. Laboratory data on admission revealed a WBC count of 1,760/uL, Hb 10.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 297,000/uL. Arterial blood gas analysis while breathing room air revealed PaO2 of 48.0 mmHg, PaCO2 of 32.7 mmHg, and saturation of 88.5%, and the calculated (A-a)DO2 was 53.7. CD4 count and HIV viral load were 4/uL and 130,000 IU/mL, respectively. Diffuse bilateral infiltrates of both lung fields were noted, and no cystic lesions were observed on the chest X-ray and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) taken on admission. Bronchoscopic alveolar lavage for diagnosis of P. jirovecii was carried out, and microscopic examination of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained showed P. jirovecii; no other microorganisms were detected by culture. Treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fluconazole and corticosteroids at standard dosages was started. The patient had never been on HAART therapy prior to admission. HAART therapy was added to the treatment on the 8th hospital day. During the treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, pancytopenia worsened. Bone marrow biopsy revealed inflamed marrow and partial necrosis. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor was used without avail. On the 22nd hospital day, the chest X-ray obtained as the patient's hypoxemia worsened revealed pneumomediastinum. HRCT showed newly formed cystic lesions in both lung fields. Pneumomediastinum was treated conservatively with high oxygen supply. CD4 cell count and HIV levels were not followed during treatment. However, as the general condition of the patient deteriorated, the patient was started on intravenous pentamidine on the 23rd hospital day. On the 25th hospital day, his oxygen requirement increased. Without intubation, as the patient and guardian refused the patient being put on a ventilator due to multiple economical and sociological reasons, the patient died on the 26th hospital day.

    "question": "A 22-month-old girl was admitted to our hospital with a three-day history of cough and rhinorrhea, a one-day history of fever, and an episode of generalized tonic clonic seizure with fever that lasted around 10 to 15 minute at 15 hours before admission.\nUpon arrival at the emergency center, her pulse rate was 140/min, blood pressure was 115/74 mmHg, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min, and body temperature was 40.2\u2103. She had no spontaneous movement, no response to painful stimuli, no pupillary reflex, and no corneal reflex. Doll's eye movement was absent. Her pupils were 1 mm in diameter and nonreactive to light. Deep tendon reflexes were absent.\nApproximately 1 hour after arrival she had a second generalized tonic clonic seizure with fever that lasted 10 seconds, and was treated with 0.3 mg/kg of intravenous diazepam. She had dark brown-colored hematemesis, so we performed L-tube irrigation with normal saline. A computed tomography (CT) scan indicated diffuse symmetric low density in the basal ganglia, thalami, and pons with brain swelling (). Because of brain swelling, unstable vital sign, and thrombocytopenia, we decided to defer lumbar puncture and after all we did not make it. She was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nHer platelet count was 32,000/\u00b5L, white blood cell was 6,240/\u00b5L, aspartate aminotransferase was 4,579 U/L, alanine aminotransferase was 2,787 U/L, ammonia was 38 mmol/L and C-reactive protein was 1.0 mg/dL. Coagulation testing for prothrombin, partial thromboplastin and thrombin times, fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer were elevated. Blood urea nitrogen was 30 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL. Creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin, and troponin-T were elevated. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reactions for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus were negative, but the test for parainfluenza virus was positive on a nasal wash specimen. Serological tests for hepatitis viruses, mycoplasma, herpes virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and salmonella were all negative.\nElectroencephalography indicated extremely low voltage and featureless background rhythms (). Brain MRI performed on the day of hospitalization indicated diffuse bilateral symmetric signal changes of both basal ganglia, thalami, periventricular white matter, pons, and cerebral white matter, as well as generalized swelling of the brain. The involved areas were diffusely hypointense on T1W images () and hyperintense on T2W images (). We diagnosed the patient with ANE based on the clinical symptoms and MRI findings.\nThe patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated because of shallow breathing and profound alteration of sensorium on the day of hospitalization and she was treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin, and methylprednisolone. A chest X-ray was normal at admission, but indicated right perihilar infiltration on the 5th day of admission. Her consciousness had no interval change, and blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output decreased on day 13. The 14th day of admission, she died due to multiple organ failure.

    "question": "A 62-year-old female patient underwent a laparoscopic anterior resection procedure for sigmoid colon cancer. The patient who was discharged on postoperative day four uneventfully presented with complaints of abdominal pain, distended abdomen, nausea, and fever lasting for 24 hours on 4th day after discharge. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable except for a previous diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus for which she received prednisolone 16 mg/day as treatment.\nOn physical examination, she had fever at 38.7 C, blood pressure was 110/60 mm/Hg, heart rate was 100/min, and the respiratory rate was 18/min. She was in mild/acute distress and she was alert and oriented. Abdominal examination was notable for distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, and tenderness in all quadrants. There was guarding and rebound in the lower quadrants of the abdomen.\nLaboratory evaluation was remarkable for leukocytosis 18,000/mm3 (4500\u201310,000/mm3), and highly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 372 mg/dL (normal range < 5 mg/dL). All other laboratory parameters including electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were within the normal range. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed extravasation of luminal contrast from the anastomosis level into the pelvic region (). In addition, a collection of fluid measuring 8 \u00d7 5 cm was noticed in the pelvis. There was associated free air in the peritoneum.\nA diagnosis of peritonitis due to anastomosis leakage was made and urgent surgical intervention was recommended. The laparoscopic approach was planned. The abdomen was entered laparoscopically via the previous trocar sites. On laparoscopic exploration, the anastomosis site was characterized with small bowel adhesions covered with layers of fibrin clots and purulent fluid accumulation in the pelvic region. Aspiration of the purulent fluid was performed followed by separation of the small bowel adhesions. A 1 cm colon peritoneal fistula covered with fibrin layers was identified at the anastomosis site, which localized intraperitoneally. There was no fecal contamination. The abdomen was irrigated with isotonic saline solution and a complete decontamination of the pelvic contents was performed. After adequate drainage of pelvic collection, a drain was placed through the port site at the left lower quadrant across the anastomosis site into the pelvic region and the procedure was ended. The need for an ostomy was precluded as an endoscopic stent was planned for the closure of the anastomosis site. However, because our endoscopy unit had not been work at night time as emergency services, the patient was sent to the endoscopy unit on 5th hour after the operation.\nAt sigmoidoscopy, the anastomosis site with 1 cm fistula was identified at 17 cm above the anal verge (). To close the fistula, a 12 cm long partially coated SEMS (Hanarostent Duodenum/Pylorus Lasso, NCN, MI Tech Co., Seoul, South Korea) was placed across the site of leak successfully (). The patient was placed on prophylactic treatment with a third generation cephalosporin and intravenous metronidazole. A dramatic decrease in the patients fever and leukocytosis was observed 24 hours after the procedure. Abdominal pain gradually resolved and oral feeding was started. Abdominal drainage which started at a rate of 150\u2013200 cc/day ceased after 5 days. Follow-up CT demonstrated complete resolution of the anastomosis leak and abscess. The drain was removed and stent removal was planned at four weeks after the procedures. On the seventh postoperative day, the patient was discharged uneventfully. Twenty-four days after the procedure, the patient presented again. She reported an incident of the stent falling out and passing in bowel motion. Sigmoidoscopy was performed and it was consistent with a complete healing of the anastomosis site, while the absence of the stent in the previously inserted location was confirmed (). During follow-up, the patients remained well with no complaints with defecation. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 77-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with intractable nausea and bilious and non-bloody vomiting of one-day duration. This was associated with diffuse abdominal pain which he described as dull, non-radiating, and moderate in severity. His symptoms were exacerbated by oral intake. Prior to his presentation, he had normal bowel movements. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysphagia, diarrhea, or constipation. Past medical and surgical histories were noncontributory. The patient previously smoked 1.5 packs per day for 20 years but quit 31 years ago. He reported moderate alcohol use and denied illicit drug use.\nThree weeks prior to his presentation to the emergency department, he was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He did not receive chemotherapy and elected for conservative management as well as palliative care. One day prior to his presentation, he underwent EUS-guided CPN for palliation of his debilitating pain. The procedure involved injecting bupivacaine and 98% absolute alcohol under general anesthesia to induce unilateral celiac plexus neurolysis. There were no immediate post-procedure complications, and the patient was discharged home in a stable condition soon after completion of the neurolysis. Of note, the patient was using oxycodone 5 mg oral tablets three times per day as needed for pain since his cancer diagnosis. In the last three weeks prior to the procedure, he did not complain of nausea or constipation. He also denied taking the medication more frequently than usual.\nIn the emergency department, vital signs demonstrated blood pressure of 115/73 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.2\u2103. Abdominal exam was significant for minimal epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. The remainder of the physical exam was noncontributory. Complete blood count (CBC) showed white blood cell (WBC) of 10.0 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 295 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L. Basic metabolic panel (BMP) showed sodium of 135 mmol/L, potassium of 5.1 mmol/L, chloride of 96 mmol/L, creatinine of 1.34 mg/dL, glucose of 384 mg/dL, and anion gap of 9 mmol/L. Liver function tests showed aspartate transaminase (AST) of 12 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 17 U/L, alkaline phosphatase of 74 U/L, and total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL. Lipase was within reference range at 5.0 U/L. Urinalysis did not reveal ketones. Hemoglobin A1c was unremarkable at 5.4% and glucose levels normalized without treatment, suggesting that the initial hyperglycemia was probably related to stress.\nThe patient initially received intravenous fluids and was placed on a bowel rest regimen. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed significant gastric distension, which was concerning for obstruction at the level of the duodenum (Figure ).\nNext, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed large amounts of fluids within the gastric fundus and body, which was also concerning for duodenal obstruction. The examined first and second parts of the duodenum were normal (Figure ).\nAs a result, upper gastrointestinal series with barium swallow was performed to look for an obstruction distal to the second part of the duodenum. Although it showed delayed gastric emptying of the contrast, contrast was seen in the third part of the duodenum and jejunum ruling out a complete obstruction in the duodenum (Figure ).\nFinally, a push enteroscopy was performed to visualize the entire duodenum. It showed angulation in the third part of the duodenum but no obstruction or mucosal abnormalities in the third or fourth parts of the duodenum (Figure ).\nAt that point, extensive gastrointestinal workup ruled out small bowel obstruction, and the diagnosis of ileus was made. The patient received ondansetron and polyethylene glycol as needed, and his diet was advanced slowly. His symptoms improved over the course of a few days, and he experienced a return of normal bowel activity. He eventually tolerated a regular diet and was discharged home in a stable condition.

More than 40 stings marks were found across her head, neck, both upper and lower extremities, buttocks, and back. On admission, blood pressure was 60/49 mmHg and pulse rate was 120 per minute. She was given intravenous fluids, hydrocortisone, and antihistamines. Her vital signs and symptoms recovered, and she was discharged. The next day, she returned to the hospital complaining of dyspnea, nausea, general ache, edema, and decreased amount of urine. She has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension for 20 years. She had chronic kidney disease stage III, and her estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been measured at 55.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 four months before the wasp stings. She had undergone surgery and chemotherapy for colon cancer nine years ago. She was taking medications including telmisartan 40 mg, pravastatin 10 mg, glimepiride 2 mg, metformin 500 mg, and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg.\nHer mentality was drowsy, and blood pressure was 158/83 mmHg, pulse rate 118/min, body temperature 36.2\u00b0C, and respiratory rate 20/min. There was mild tenderness in the epigastric area without rebound tenderness. Urine color was dark brown, and the hourly urine output was 10\u201320 cc. The initial laboratory results were serum hemoglobin 11.7 g/dL, white blood cell count 18,200 cells per microliter, platelets 213,000/uL, blood urea nitrogen 66 mg/dL, creatinine 3.97 mg/dL, eGFR 10.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, sodium 130 meq/L, potassium 8.0 meq/L, ionized calcium 1.01 mmol/L, phosphorous 12.5 mg/dL, serum bilirubin 4.7 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 10380 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 3302 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 8356 IU/L (reference: 140\u2013271 IU/L), creatinine kinase (CK) 98,862 IU/L (reference: <171 IU/L), PT 18 sec (reference: 11.8\u201314.3 sec), PTT 121.3 sec (reference: 29\u201344 sec), D-dimer 4499.69 ng/mL (reference: <500 ng/mL), FDP 5~20 ug/mL (reference: <5 ug/mL), fibrinogen 441 mg/dL (reference: 180\u2013400 mg/dL), amylase 205 IU/L (reference: 22\u201385 IU/L), and lipase 622 IU/L (reference: 21\u201367 U/L). Arterial blood gas analysis results were pH 7.11, pCO2 26 mmHg, HCO3 9.5 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation 93%. Urine analysis revealed a 1.025 specific gravity, protein 3+, occult blood 4+, RBC 5\u20139/HPF, and WBC 1\u20134/HPF. Viral markers for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV were negative. Chest X-ray did not show pulmonary edema or abnormal infiltration. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia, absent P wave, and tall T wave.\nAbdominal computed tomography showed peripancreatic fat infiltration in the tail portion, suggesting acute pancreatitis grade C (). Whole body bone scintigraphy showed multiple radioiodine uptake in the head, shoulder, hip, and both upper and lower extremities (). Approximately 1\u20133-cm sized blisters were formed at the sites of the wasp stings and lasted for one week (). The skin biopsy showed subdermal bullae with eosinophilic infiltration.\nContinuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated 30 hours after the wasp stings. Serum CK level and liver function test were significantly improved during maintenance of CRRT for three days. Serum amylase and lipase level were decreased to less than three times the upper reference limit six days after the wasp stings. However, AKI was persistent and peak serum creatinine level was 8.58 mg/dL on the 13th day after admission. We underwent 11 sessions of conventional hemodialysis until renal function was restored. Ten months after the wasp stings, her serum creatinine level had improved to 1.6 mg/dL (eGFR 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "We present a 20-year-old female with no previous medical history who was brought to the hospital by her parents. Two days prior she became nauseated and had one episode of emesis, then she became sleepy and subsequently became less responsive. On initial assessment, she was obtunded, had a temperature of 36.9\u00b0C, a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On neurological assessment both pupils were three millimeters, equal and reactive to light, her eyes were open spontaneously, she was moving all her limbs spontaneously, but was not following command, she was also making incomprehensible sounds, not responding to questions. The examination of her lungs, heart, and abdomen was unremarkable.\nComplete blood count revealed white blood cells 18.5 cells/\u00b5L (normal 3.5-10.6 cells/\u00b5L), hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL (normal 13.3-17.1 g/dL), and platelet 280 x 10^3 /microliter. Biochemical labs showed abnormalities consistent with DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate 128 mg/dL (normal 0.2-2.8) (Table ). Her labs also revealed acute kidney injury (AKI) with creatinine (Cr) of 4.54 mg/dL (normal 0.70-1.30) (Table ). A urine drug screen was negative. Infectious workup with chest X-ray, COVID-19 nasal swab, urine analysis, urine culture, and blood culture were done but were unremarkable. She was started on an insulin drip and IV fluids for DKA, in less than 24 hours a repeat lab is done (Table ).\nLater on the second day of admission, her mental status deteriorated further, she became none responsive, her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) dropped to three and she was subsequently intubated for airway protection and her ventilator settings were set at a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute, a tidal volume of 500 mL, a fraction of inspired oxygen of 100%, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of five cm H2O. CT scan of her brain was obtained quickly and showed changes consistent with CE (Figure ). Neurology team was consulted, she had electroencephalography (EEG) done which showed moderate to severe degree of cerebral dysfunction consistent with metabolic/hypoxic encephalopathy, the waveforms were not epileptiform in nature. Despite multiple interventions including lowering PaCO2 to 25-30 mmHg, hypertonic saline 3%, pentobarbital coma, and cooling the patient to 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F), she did not show any signs of improvement.\nOn the third day and fourth day of admission, her condition continued to worsen, and so on the fifth day and because she was not exhibiting response to painful stimuli, no brainstem reflexes, neurology proceeded with a brain death exam, which she had no arousal to voice or sternal rub, no withdrawal to painful stimuli, no cough response, gag or corneal reflexes, her pupils were dilated and fixed, nonreactive to light.

    "question": "A 71-year-old male presented in September 2014 with right flank pain, 10 kg weight loss over past 1 month. He had a past medical history of gout, but no past surgical history. The patient was a current smoker with a 20-pack-year smoking history and chronic alcoholics, with a 0.5 bottle per day, over 40 yrs. He had no prior liver insult.\nPhysical examination revealed no specific finding. He did not have palpable lymph nodes on the head, neck, and inguinal area. There was no suspicious skin lesion. Digital rectal examination was negative, and no perirectal mass or lesion was found. Breathing sound was clear without wheezing or crackle.\nInitial vital sign was non-specific (blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate 70/min, respiratory rate 20/min, body temperature 36.3\u00b0C). Laboratory work-up showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP)/Gamma-guanosine triphosphate (r-GTP) level of 345/245 IU/L. But total bilirubin 0.44 mg/dL, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (AST) 22 IU/L and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT) 27 IU/L level were within normal limits. Complete blood count showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia (WBC 14,800/mm3, segmented neutrophil 79.5%), anemia (Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytosis (Platelet 485 \u00d7103/mm3). Hepatitis viral markers were all negative, and Ca 19-9 level was slightly elevated (28.58 U/mL). Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) 1.38ng/mL, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II) 55 mAU/mL, carcino-embryonic Antigen (CEA) level were 4.45 ng/mL, all of them were within normal limits.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a 10 \u00d7 6 cm sized low attenuated mass involving segment VIII and left lobe of the liver, invading left portal vein and bile duct. Unlike primary hepatocellular carcinoma, liver mass showed delayed fill-in enhancement pattern, which mimics cholangiocarcinoma, rather than primary hepatocellular carcinoma (). But Tumor thrombi was invading the middle hepatic vein, extending to the right atrium via inferior vena cava, which was unusual finding for mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma ().\nAlso, there were multiple metastatic lymphadenopathy involving porta hepatis, portocaval, retrocaval and paraaortic space, with benign-looking multiple cysts in the both kidneys, 2.2 cm cyst in the uncinate process of pancreas.\nNon-enhanced Chest CT from other hospital showed metastasis to the right ninth rib and surrounding paravertebral soft tissue with osteolytic change (). As mass size was huge and showed the aggressive form, we decided to perform positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) for evaluating disease extent.\nAdditionally, PET-CT scan revealed a small hypermetabolic lymph node in the left supraclavicular area, which was suspected as metastatic lesion (). Excisional biopsy on supraclavicular lymph node returned negative. In turn, we had to perform an ultrasonography guided needle biopsy of the liver for pathologic confirmation. Pathology of the liver mass showed infiltrating feature with squamoid shaped cells with varying degrees of differentiation and atypia, which suggests tumor mass as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (). Immunohistochimistry and special staining for needle biopsy specimens were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, 8, 19, and p63. And anti-hepatocyte was negative, suggesting tumor as primary or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the liver ().\nThe patient underwent an extensive workup to search for a primary squamous carcinoma lesion, including neck CT, chest CT, duodenoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, laryngoscopy and ENT survey, all of which turned out to be negative. Taken together, we concluded the tumor as a primary SCC of the liver.\nDuring the hospital day, patient presented uncontrolled high and recurrent fever, which was suspected to be the cancer fever. Patient\u2019s general condition continued to get worsen. First, we considered palliative chemotherapy, however we failed to conduct due to his poor general condition (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 3). The patient started palliative radiotherapy for right paravertebral mass. After 10 times of radiation therapy, patient refused further treatment and transferred to the local hospital for hospice care, and passed away about a month after discharge.

    "question": "An 88-year-old woman with a history of dementia, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, and chronic cholelithiasis presented with nausea and non-bloody emesis for two days. No abdominal pain, fever, chills, dysuria, hematuria, melena, or hematochezia were exhibited.\nShe was hospitalized three years prior for a similar presentation. At that time, a CT scan was obtained which showed a large stone within the gallbladder (Figure ). During that presentation, the patient refused any surgical intervention and was treated conservatively. One year later, the patient returned with a similar presentation in which a second CT was obtained (Figure ) which showed a gall stone, as well as inflammatory changes and possible duodenal stricture. Thereafter, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and showed duodenopathy with a post-bulbar duodenal stricture. It was thought that the cholelithiasis may have caused inflammatory changes of the duodenum and led to the stricture formation. Pathological examination failed to demonstrate malignancy or Helicobacter pylori infection. She was treated conservatively per her request to avoid surgical intervention.\nExamination on this admission revealed a core temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 78, a respiratory rate of 16, and an elevated blood pressure of 171/89. The patient had a normal mental status, respiratory, and cardiovascular examination. Abdominal examination was significant for moderate abdominal distention but otherwise unremarkable. Murphy\u2019s sign was negative. There was no guarding or rigidity, no hernia was observed, and no masses or enlarged liver or spleen were palpated. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for an alkaline phosphatase of 283 unit/L (normal: 25 - 100), serum glucose of 171 mg/dl, and leukocytosis of 16.7 with a left shift. In addition, the renal panel was abnormal with a blood urea nitrogen of 33 and creatinine of 6.3. Other hepatic, hematologic, and metabolic studies were unremarkable.\nAn abdominal roentgenogram showed an abnormal gas pattern with distended gastric outline and gastrectasis which was increased compared to her prior studies obtained two years ago. A moderate stool burden was noted throughout the inferior colon and rectum representing fecal impaction. No free air or significant calcification were noted. An abdominal CT scan (Figure ) showed a large 4 cm gallstone in the duodenal bulb with interval development of air within the biliary tree and common duct. A nasogastric tube was placed and drained > 1 liter of dark, red-tinged fluid. Endoscopic studies revealed a normal esophagus, gastric antrum, and pylorus. Debris and fluid were found in the stomach and were suctioned using a gastroscope. A normal duodenal bulb with a large gallstone (4 - 5 cm) at the apex into the duodenal sweep was found. This was surrounded by mucosal edema. Because of the stone angulation, it was difficult to obtain purchase on the stone. Different devices were used in attempts to free the stone from the duodenum and manipulating it into the stomach. Efforts failed due to the calcified nature of the stone, the angulation of the duodenum, extensive inflammatory changes surrounding the stone, and the size of the stone. Subsequently, surgical management was discussed with the patient and her family who agreed to proceed with the operation.\nDiagnostic laparoscopy was attempted but failed due to the difficulty accessing the area of interest laparoscopically. Thus, an exploratory laparotomy was carried out. A midline incision was made and dissection was carried down until the duodenum was once again palpated. Attempts were made trying to move the stone proximally into the stomach; however, there was significant inflammation, as well as adhesions, in the duodenum from the longstanding cholecystitis and cholecystoduodenal fistula. Multiple attempts were made to try to lyse the adhesions, trying to free the angle into the stomach or make it less acute. Despite lysing all the adhesions and performing a limited Kocher maneuver, the attempts to move the stone into the stomach were unsuccessful. The surgical team then attempted to pass the stone more distally in an attempt to take it out through a jejunal enterotomy. The stoned moved freely down to D3/D4, but unfortunately, we were unable to move the stone beyond the ligament of Treitz. The ligament of Treitz was taken down, along with adhesions in the area; however, we were still unable to remove the stone. As there was some hematoma forming in this area, we elected to then proceed with a duodenotomy to retrieve the stone. The stone was moved back to D2, and electrocautery was used to make a 5 cm duodenotomy on the lateral antimesenteric border of the duodenum. The stone was encountered, freed, and extracted from the duodenum (Figure ). Repair of the duodenum and omental flap creation were performed. This was followed by placement of a gastrojejunostomy feeding tube. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "A 40-year-old man was hospitalized due to jaundice and lethargic fatigue that started 10 days prior to admission. The patient had complaints of weight loss and night sweats. Four months prior to this admission, he had visited to the Department of ENT at another hospital with the complaint of nasal stuffiness. At that time, the serologic testing for hepatitis B antigen and anti-HIV antibody were positive. He has been treated with zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz for two months until admission. He assumed that his AIDS was transmitted from heterosexual contact at abroad ten years ago. On admission, the blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, the pulse rate 90/min, the respiratory rate 20/min and the body temperature was 36.6\u2103. He was icteric on the physical examination. The liver was tender and firm in consistency. It was palpated at a three-finger breadth below the right costal margin. His spleen and lymph nodes were not enlarged. The laboratory results were normal apart from an ESR of 120 mm/h; leukopenia 3,930/mm3 (neutrophils: 58.8%, lymphocytes: 31% and monocytes: 8.4%) and hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL. The liver function tests were abnormal: total bilirubin 8.9 mg/dL (direct bilirubin: 6.05 mg/dL), AST 171 IU/L, ALT 100 IU/L and LDH 1063 IU/L. The total number of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes was 290/mm3 and 568/mm3, respectively, and the ratio of CD4/CD8 was 0.51. Abdominal enhanced CT scanning revealed multifocal and variable sized homogenous hypodense masses in both hepatic lobes (). A liver biopsy showed a heavy infiltration composed mainly of large lymphoid cells (). Immunohistochemical staining revealed the atypical cells to be CD20 positive (), which established a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma according to the WHO classification. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated normal cellularity with normal maturation of all three cell lines. There was no malignant cell infiltration. After the patient was diagnosed as having diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, he received VAD (vincristine 0.4 mg, adriamycin 9 mg/m2, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, and additional dexamethasone on days 9-12 and days 17-20). The patient seemed to show a little clinical improvement, but before starting the second chemotherapy, he developed signs of spinal cord compression (). Emergency radiation therapy was delivered to the spine lesion. CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, adriamycin 50 mg/m2 and vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 on day 1 and prednisone 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5) and laminectomy induced temporary improvement (). Alas, the paraplegia continued and his clinical condition progressively worsened. He passed away 103 days after starting the second round of chemotherapy from complications of pressure sores, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism.

    "question": "A 64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for bronchial asthma with atypical pneumonia unresolved by antibiotic treatment. She had no history of being diagnosed as asthma but had suffered from intermittent sensation of chest constriction by exposure to cold air.\nShe had taken steroid for her joint arthritis without consulting a doctor for several years. She has never smoked and had no history of tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus or other cardiovascular disease. About 20 days before admission, the patient suffered from fever, cough, sputum and dyspnea. She visited another hospital and was treated with antibiotics and steroids. Despite treatment, there was no clinical improvement of her symptoms. She was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\nOn admission, her body temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, pulse rate was 110/min, respiration rate was 24/min and blood pressure was 160/100 mmHg. Physical examination revealed bilateral diffuse inspiratory crackle without wheezing. Laboratory tests were performed: white blood cell count was 48,220/\u03bcL (neutrophils were 98%, monocytes 1% and lymphocytes 1%), hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 32.1% and platelet count 394,000/\u03bcL on complete blood cell counts. Arterial blood gas analysis findings were pH 7.497, PaCO2 42.5 mmHg, PaO2 63.4 mmHg, bicarbonate 32.6 mmol/L and oxygen saturation 93.3% on oxygen 3 L/min via nasal prong. Sodium was 126 mEq/L, potassium 2.7 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, urea nitrogen 13.9 mg/dL, creatinine 1.24 mg/dL, cholesterol 168 mg/dL, total protein 5.1 mg/dL, albumin 2.6 mg/dL, AST 22 IU/L, ALT 22 IU/L and total bilirubin was 0.82 mg/dL on blood chemistry. Chest radiography and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed multifocal variable-sized consolidation with reticulonodular opacities () and cavitary lesion in both upper lobes and right lower lobe. There were also multiple small nodular densities and ground glass attenuation around the consolidation ().\nMicroscopic examination of sputum showed no acid-fast bacilli. Other laboratory findings, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE PRIST, C3, C4, CH50, rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antistreptolysin-O (ASO), VDRL and cold cryoglobulin, were all negative.\nDespite empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroid treatment, dyspnea progressively aggravated. Open lung biopsy was done on the tenth hospital day. Histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen showed large areas of necrotizing pneumonia with an infarct-like appearance (). There were some scattered fungal hyphae within the lung parenchyma (). The bronchi and bronchioles often showed dilated lumen which were filled with mucus, numerous necrotic debris, inflammatory cells and branching septated hyphae characteristic of aspergillus. Some terminal bronchioles were found to be destroyed and were replaced by granulomatous inflammation (). The bronchocentric granulomatous reaction extended into the adjacent lung parenchyma to a degree. Gomori-Methenamine-Silver (GMS) staining revealed many fungal hyphae consistent with aspergillus species. There was no evidence of angioinvasion by aspergillus or aspergillous emboli. With an impression of invasive aspergillus infection with BCG-like elements, 15 mg of amphotericin-B once day was administered intravenously and the dose was increased up to 30 mg daily. Steroids was tapered progressively. There were some improvement in her clinical symptoms. However despite vigorous antifungal treatment, sudden respiratory arrest occurred due to acute tracheobronchial tree obstruction with bronchial casts on the thirty-fourth hospital day. Histopathologic examination of the casts revealed fibrinoid necrotic tissue containing neutrophils, a few metaplastic squamous cell nests and variably fragmented fungal hyphae ().

    "question": "In December 2019, a right-handed 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with increasing right shoulder pain and raised inflammatory parameters. Her past medical history was remarkable for paraplegia due to poliomyelitis in childhood and a residual epilepsy due to the sequelae of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Apart from these conditions, for which she was wheelchair-bound, this patient was in good general health with a previous non-pathologic and well-functioning right shoulder.\nOne month prior to her admission with shoulder pain, she was involved in a car accident as a result of a tonic-clonic seizure. Upon admission, she developed hypertension with associated proteinuria and was diagnosed with a 26-week gestation previously unknown pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. She was previously nulliparous. At day six of hospitalization, the patient presented a spontaneous placental abruption and underwent an emergency caesarean section with a simple post-operative evolution.\nPhysical exam of her right upper extremity revealed a swollen, warm and painful right shoulder on palpation and mobilization without neurovascular disorder. On general examination, she had moderate asthenia without disorientation. The vital signs were: Temperature of 37.2 \u00b0C, heart rate at 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/95 mmHg, respiratory rate at 23 per minute and an oxygen saturation within the norm (SpO2 95% breathing ambient air).\nHemoglobin was 101 G/L, leukocytes 9.8 G/L, thrombocytes 305 G/L and C-reactive protein was increased to 271 mg/L. Blood cultures were sent for culture.\nSuspecting right shoulder septic arthritis without any degenerative sign on X-ray (Fig. ), she underwent open surgical debridement, synovectomy and 9 L saline solution lavage of the right shoulder by a delto-pectoral approach with subscapularis tenotomy. Abundant pus at arthrotomy was observed with the observation of a stage 3 equivalent according to G\u00e4chter\u2019s classification [].\nAwaiting culture results, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous 2,2 g 3td amoxicilline and clavulanic acid was initiated.\nWhilst the blood cultures and intra-operative cultures remained sterile (Fig. ) without any crystals positivity on microscopic analysis, the clinical evolution was unfavorable with persistent pain, inflammation and purulent drainage. The patient required two additional surgical debridements and lavages on days 4 and day 7 after the first surgery. Both surgical interventions revealed persistent amounts of purulent and fibrous material despite the previous procedures and the empirical antibiotic treatment.\nThe 16S ribosomal RNA PCR performed on the purulent intra-operative liquid revealed U. urealyticum at 2.95 \u00d7 106 copies/ml (Fig. ), positive specific cultures inoculated a posteriori confirmed this finding (Fig. ).\nCervical smear showed no simultaneous U. urealyticum genital infection. Fresh placental tissue was not available for further testing, but there was no evident macroscopic chorio-amnionitis.\nUpon receiving the microbiological documentation, a bi-therapy of levofloxacin and azithromycine was initiated. Susceptibility testing showed an intermediate sensibility to ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin. The strain was susceptible to doxycycline. Following cessation of breastfeeding, we started treatment with doxycycline for 4 weeks according to the guidelines of our institution and on the basis of the low initial therapeutic response []. Early mobilization was started with our physiotherapist (Fig. ). She showed a favorable course with an excellent biological and functional outcome with a post-surgical DASH score of 5,8 at 3 months follow-up []. As a reminder, a DASH score of 0 represents no disability and a score of 100 represents severe disability after surgery. Concerning the father of the infant, no other specific considerations were taken related to this infection. The infant presented good clinical evolution. What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",

    "question": "The patient was a 34-year-old Japanese man, whose family history included a father with hypertension, and a mother that suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, but which did not include either a consanguineous marriage or any incidence of renal cysts. At the age of 31, the patient presented with mild albuminuria, and a serum creatinine (Cr) level of 2.98 mg/dL. At the age of 34, the patient was admitted to hospital with a creatinine level of 8.2 mg/dL.\nUpon admission, the patient's height, weight, and blood pressure were 179 cm, 58 kg, and 126/80 mm Hg, respectively. The patient exhibited anemia (Hb 8.2 g/dL), azotemia (Cr 8.38 mg/dL), hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and secondary hyperparathyroidism; thus, he was diagnosed with ESRD. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed that, although the size of both kidneys appeared to be normal, the patient's renal parenchyma showed increased brightness. We performed a percutaneous renal biopsy; histologically, six of 16 glomeruli displayed global sclerosis, along with mild cellular infiltration, conspicuous interstitial fibrosis, renal tubular atrophy, and cystoid irregular dilation (Figure ), suggesting an NPHP diagnosis. We performed targeted sequencing using a next-generation sequencer, with the approval by the research ethics committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the patient's written informed consent. A homozygous full gene deletion of NPHP1 (NM_000272.3:g110879716-110962709) was resultantly identified, as well as heterozygous substitutions in PKD1 (NM_0001009944.2:c.6395T>G(p.Phe2132Cys)) (Figure ), BBS1 (NM_024649.4:c.908T>C(p.Val303Ala)), and INPP5E (NM_019892.4:c.1652C>T(p.Thr551Met)).

    "question": "A 65-year-old woman (weight, 44 kg; height, 153 cm) was admitted to our hospital for an elective total thyroidectomy. She had been diagnosed with a papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Her medical history included hypertension, minor depression, a cerebral infarction, and brain surgery. Her medications included aspirin, a calcium channel blocker, and antidepressant. The preoperative chest radiograph and electrocardiography revealed no abnormalities. Echocardiography revealed mild pulmonary hypertension. The blood tests were within the normal limits.\nHer blood pressure, heart rate and SpO2 was 140/70 mmHg, 80 beats/min and 99%, respectively. General anesthesia was induced with thiopental 5 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. She was intubated without problems using a 7.0 mm oral endotracheal tube that was fixed 22 cm from the mouth. Anesthesia was maintained with air 1 L/min, O2 1 L/min, sevoflurane 1-2 vol% and a continuous infusion of remifentanil 0.01-0.05 \u00b5g/kg/min. Her vital signs, airway pressures, and end-tidal CO2 remained stable during surgery. The planned surgical procedure was performed uneventfully in 2 hours and 55 minutes. A total volume of 900 ml lactated Ringer's solution was administered. During surgery, the estimated blood loss was 200 ml and urine output was 300 ml. After reversing the muscle relaxant, the patient was extubated in the operating room after confirming her ability to obey commands and her full recovery of motor function as tested by the hand grip and head control.\nOn the way to the post-anesthesia care unit, the patient was unable to breath and became cyanotic. The initial blood pressure at the recovery room was 110/60 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats/min, and SpO2 was 78%. The oral airway was maintained and manual bagging was started with 100% oxygen at 10 L/min but there was considerable resistance and adequate oxygenation could not be maintained. A decision was made to reintubate the patient with midazolam 2 mg and succinylcholine 2 mg/kg while inserting an arterial line catheter into the left radial artery. Direct laryngoscopy revealed no specific abnormalities, such as laryngeal edema or aspirate. The patient was intubated successfully with a 7.0-mm endotracheal tube and ventilated several times with a bag valve mask with less resistance. However, a large volume of pink, frothy fluid emerged from the endotracheal tube, prompting an interim diagnosis of pulmonary edema. Pulmonary auscultation revealed moist rales in the entire bilateral lung fields. Despite the continued manual ventilation and tracheal suction with 100% O2, the SpO2 remained at approximately 80%. The first arterial blood gas analysis was as follows: pH 7.40, PaCO2 30.4 mmHg, PaO2 35.0 mmHg, SaO2 66.8% at FiO2 1.0. A portable chest radiograph confirmed the typical pattern of pulmonary edema with symmetric bilateral infiltrates and a slightly enlarged heart (). As a treatment of pulmonary edema, morphine 3 mg and furosemide 20 mg were administered. After 10 minutes, spontaneous respiration was observed and the patient could reply to verbal commands.\nThe patient was transferred to the ICU for ventilatory support with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7 cm H2O. The patient's SpO2 remained > 97% on 100% oxygen. The follow-up arterial blood gas analysis was as follows: pH 7.39, PaCO2 33.6 mmHg, PaO2 125 mmHg, SaO2 98.9% at FiO2 1.0. The cardiac enzyme studies and echocardiography were unremarkable. Extubation was attempted on the second postoperative day because her SpO2 remained at 100%, her breathing was spontaneous, and her chest radiograph had improved (). Immediately after extubation, however, the patient became cyanotic and hypoxia developed and she was reintubated. According to the advice of our cardiologist colleagues, repeated echocardiography and coronary angiography was performed, which suggested transient stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Dobutamine 5 \u00b5g/kg/min was infused. The patient was extubated successfully and weaned from the dobutamine infusion on the sixth postoperative day but still showed some degree of dyspnea on 3 L/min via nasal cannula. Otolaryngology consultation attributed the residual dyspnea and the initial upper airway obstruction to bilateral vocal cord dysfunction. Given the possibility of sudden respiratory arrest, the patient underwent a tracheostomy. What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m\u00b2.",

    "question": "GK is a 43-year-old right-hand dominant nonsmoking female who presented to our office with right shoulder pain. The patient had symptoms for nine months following a motor-vehicle accident where she was a restrained passenger. The patient stated she had severe pain at the anterolateral aspect of her right shoulder, difficulty lifting greater than five pounds, limited overhead motion, and subjective catching. Physical examination showed her height, weight, and body mass index were 61 inches, 135 pounds, and 25.51, respectively. After history, physical, and radiographic examination, the patient was diagnosed with a rotator cuff strain, long head biceps tenosynovitis, and acromioclavicular joint osteolysis. Over the course of one year, the patient attended 36 sessions of physical therapy, participated in a home exercise program and underwent a subacromial cortisone injection with only temporary relief. Due to her lack of progress with conservative measures, an MRI arthrogram was obtained which showed a moderate bursal-sided tear of the supraspinatus, moderate acromioclavicular joint osteolysis, and a type II superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesion. A discussion of nonoperative versus operative treatment options, outcomes, and complications occurred and the patient elected to go forward with surgery.\nAfter being brought into the operating room, the patient underwent an interscalene nerve block for intraoperative and postoperative pain control using a nerve stimulator. Bilateral lower extremity sequential compression devices were applied for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. General endotracheal tube anesthesia (GETA) was administered. The patient was then positioned into the modified lateral decubitus position (patient rolled back 30 degrees) using a foam wedge with all bony prominences well padded. An axillary roll was placed one hand breadth distal to the axilla, and the patient was secured with Velcro straps. After sterile draping and time-out, the patient's operative extremity was placed in ten pounds of balanced suspension in the scapular plane.\nUpon shoulder arthroscopy, the patient was found to have a type II SLAP lesion with a long head biceps that had inflammation and fraying. The articular side of the rotator cuff had mild fraying. When viewing the subacromial space, the patient's rotator cuff was found to have significant fraying, fragmentation, and thinning of the bursal side (type A1, B3). When probed, the supraspinatus was found to be of inadequate quality due to intrasubstance tearing. In addition, the acromioclavicular joint was arthritic. As a result, the patient underwent an arthroscopic take-down and repair of the rotator cuff, a distal clavicle excision, and a miniopen subpectoralis long head biceps tenodesis. The duration of the surgery was one hour and 45 minutes with the duration of balanced suspension one hour and 20 minutes. There were no complications intraoperatively. The patient was placed into a sling with an abduction pillow and awoken from the anesthesia with no incident. She was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition.\nAt her initial postoperative visit six days after surgery, the patient presented with occasional pain in her shoulder with moderate swelling. She denied nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and sweats and had no calf tenderness. She was not menopausal. She was taking Percocet as needed as with appropriate relief but otherwise denied any additional medication history. Her incisions were clean and dry, and the stitches were removed and steri-strips applied. The patient was instructed to continue wearing her sling and abduction pillow except when performing twice daily Codman's exercises. Exercises for elbow, wrist, and finger range of motion were demonstrated, and the patient was advised to perform these twice per day.\nAt four weeks postoperatively, the patient's pain was well-controlled with no requirement for pain medication, and her wounds were well-healed. She denied fevers, chills, and calf pain. Her sling was discontinued and formal physical therapy was initiated as per our standard rotator cuff repair and biceps tenodesis protocol.\n41 days postoperatively, the patient called our office with new-onset right-hand swelling and trouble breathing. She also reported that she had been feeling \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d and stomach pains. She had no calf pain or lower extremity swelling. The patient was able to send our office a picture of her swollen hand over a secure email service with patient identification removed (). After seeing the photograph, she was advised to immediately follow up with us where upper extremity swelling and slightly labored breathing were confirmed.\nVital signs were stable and we ordered a stat computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram, which revealed that the patient had an acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in the subsegmental posterior basal segment artery of the right lower lobe (). A stat hematology consult was arranged, and the patient was admitted through the emergency room to the hematology service for further evaluation and management. The patient was started on a therapeutic dose of Lovenox and subsequently transitioned to per-oral Xarelto. Three days after admission, she underwent a bilateral upper extremity venous duplex ultrasound that was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). An immediate ultrasound upon admission was not performed due to the hematologist service's need to stabilize the patient prior to additional testing. She had no pain, swelling, or tenderness in the left upper extremity or bilateral lower extremities. A full hematology analysis was performed and was negative for any predisposing genetic factors for VTE. In assessing the patient's objective risk factors for VTE, a Revised Geneva Score was calculated and resulted in a score of two, corresponding to low risk for DVT [].\nThree days after initiation of anticoagulation therapy, the patient's constitutional symptoms and discomfort with breathing resolved. Two weeks later, her upper extremity swelling resolved. Although her preoperative pain was completely resolved, the patient developed postoperative stiffness, and at six months postoperatively she had a protracted humeral head with active forward elevation 130 degrees, external rotation 45 degrees, and internal rotation to L5. Her strength with regard to her supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and biceps was 5/5 with no pain, and a postoperative MRI at 6 months postoperatively showed complete healing of the supraspinatus repair and long head biceps tenodesis.

    "question": "A 53-year-old female patient diagnosed with DM1 was transferred to the rehabilitation medicine department due to gait disturbance. She presented with myotonia, disabling distal weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, dementia, and cataract. Dominant limb weakness started about a year prior. Since then she was housebound, and experienced difficulty in sit to stand with visible gait deviation which developed for the past 6 months. Anthropometric data at initial admission revealed a height of 160 cm, and weight of 46 kg with equivalent body mass index 18 kg/m2. Initial blood test showed total cholesterol 353 mg/dL, triglyceride 418 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol 147 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 39 mg/dL, blood glucose 105 mg/dL, but parameters reflecting liver and thyroid function were within normal range. Clinical signs concerned with diabetes were not detected. She had been taking oral statin for 2 years before the admission. On electromyography, denervation potentials and myotonic discharges were evident in all tested muscles. Southern blot analysis revealed about 650 trinucleotide (CTG) repeats expansion in the DMPK gene. She was diagnosed as DM1. She had a smoking history of 7 pack/year and alcohol abuse for the past 10 years.\nIn the course of rehabilitation, she intermittently complained of vague claudication of both lower limbs. Physical exam revealed weak pulsation of dorsalis pedis arteries with pale coloration of both ankles. Under the impression of deep vein thrombosis or PAOD, the following studies were performed. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) values were 0.09 on right side and 0.42 on left side (). Duplex ultrasonography study of lower extremity revealed a pulsus tardus parvus on femoral, popliteal, tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries (). Three-dimensional reconstructed abdomen computed tomography (CT) angiography showed concentric wall thickening and tapering occlusion in the distal abdominal aorta at 3.5 cm below the renal artery (). Under the impression of PAOD, she was advised to undergo bypass surgery from a thoracic surgery specialist. Preoperative pulmonary function test showed severe restrictive pattern (FVC, 42%; FEV1, 47%). The expected high cardiopulmonary risks of general anesthesia and surgery made us reluctant to conduct bypass surgery. However, due to diffuse extensive occlusive lesions and the patient's strong desire for the surgery, aortobifemoral artery bypass was performed. Biopsy showed fibrous wall thickening with intimal yellow patch lesion, confirmative of PAOD. Postoperative CT angiography showed patent lumen of the bypassed artery (). However, she did not recover from the post-operative respiratory complications, and died of respiratory failure 54 days after the operation. What is the patient's body surface area?

    "question": "A 64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for the treatment of chest wall necrosis. She had undergone Halsted surgery and postoperative radiation therapy with cobalt-60 (30 Gray) and megavoltage X-rays (30 Gray) 25 years earlier. Following the treatment, her left upper limb became completely paralyzed.\nSix years earlier, she had sustained a left clavicle fracture due to osteonecrosis, and she had subsequently developed a chronic cutaneous fistula measuring 1 cm in diameter. The fracture and cutaneous fistula failed to heal, and she experienced bleeding from the fistula since 1 year. Two months before visiting our hospital, she was hospitalized in the Department of Breast Surgery at another hospital for massive bleeding and local infection. She was treated with antibiotics and cleansing of the fistula and the infection subsided 2 months thereafter. She visited our hospital after discharge.\nAt initial examination, her height was 153 cm and weight was 34 kg. Necrosed clavicle was exposed through the 6-cm-wide skin defect in the left clavicular region, and air entered and exited the opening from deep within the chest while breathing (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) revealed the part of the first to third left ribs, part of the left clavicle, the subclavian artery, and the brachial plexus to be missing. Her upper left limb was nourished by retrograde blood flow from the thoracodorsal artery; however, blood flow was weak to the skin of the arm, the surface of which was cold, resulting in complete paralysis of the upper extremity. Several rounds of debridement eliminated the necrotic tissue, and the local infection was completely resolved. Debridement revealed a tissue defect measuring 4 cm \u00d7 8 cm and 4 cm deep at the base and approximately 10 bronchial stumps on the surface of the collapsed lung covered in granulation tissue, from which exhaled air and sputum were effusing (Fig. ). She presented with severe emaciation and malnutrition, but no other systemic anomalies were noted.\nAfter treatment, she had almost no problem with daily life but frequently coughed while taking baths or when exposed to cold air. Therefore, she consented to undergo the surgical closure of the pulmonary fistula. A left latissimus myocutaneous flap could not be used as the reconstructive material due to the absence of vascular pedicle (Fig. ). A free rectus abdominis flap was considered, but an omental flap was ultimately selected for its perceived ability to create the best air seal. Owing to her severe emaciation, the volume of the omentum available for harvest was considered inadequate; therefore, she was administered a diet by a nutritionist for 9 months to improve her systemic nutritional state and thereby increase her resistance. Subsequently, her weight increased from 34 kg to 38 kg, and her serum albumin level improved from 3.0 g/dL to 3.7 g/dL. Reconstructive surgery was performed. Preoperative blood gas analysis revealed pH of 7.400, carbon dioxide partial pressure of 45.3 mmHg, and oxygen partial pressure of 84.3 mmHg. Lung function test performed while holding down the pulmonary fistula revealed forced vital capacity of 1.16 L and forced expiratory volume as 1% of 100%.\nSurgery was performed under general anesthesia with selective one lung ventilation.\nThe damaged skin, clavicle, and ribs surrounding the defect were debrided. The base of the defect was covered with hemorrhagic granulation tissue and was only rubbed with gauze for debridement to avoid over expansion of the bronchial stumps. A free omental flap (approximately 155 cc) with the right gastroepiploic blood vessel as its pedicle was harvested under laparoscopy. The right transverse cervical artery and right anterior jugular vein were anastomosed with the right gastroepiploic blood vessel; the tissue defect was filled with the omentum. A 20/1000-in.-thick split-thickness skin graft was placed over the omentum, and the graft was immobilized with tie-over dressing (Fig. ).\nThe tie-over dressing was removed on the 5th postoperative day, and the engraftment of the omentum and skin graft was observed to ensure that there was no air leakage (Fig. ). However, a bulge that moved with breathing was noted on the skin graft over the omentum 2 weeks after surgery. CT confirmed this bulge to be the buildup of air between the transplanted omental tissues (omental emphysema). Pressure was applied to the bulge with scrunched up gauze and adhesive tape for 2 months; however, omental emphysema persisted even after 2 months; therefore, the dressing was removed, and she instructed to apply pressure with the hand when coughing. She is currently undergoing the follow-up and has not developed any subsequent emphysematous or respiratory infection (e.g., pneumonia). Omental emphysema persisted almost entirely without change for at least 2 years after surgery, but it spontaneously resolved by the 3rd postoperative year (Fig. ). Changes over time, as observed in CT, at 7 years after the surgery are presented in Fig. . What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m\u00b2.",

    "question": "A 32-year-old, 70 kg, 155 cm female presented with a one-month history of fever, which she treated like a common cold. Her fever did not improve. Further examination showed elevated blood and urinary noradrenaline levels. We additionally noted increased uptake of iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine in the left adrenal glands, leading to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.\nOn admission, she presented with a headache and general malaise. Her blood pressure (BP) was 126/76 mmHg, heart rate (HR) was 113 beats/min, and body temperature (BT) was 38.5 \u00b0C. Chest radiography results were unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed no left ventricular hypertrophy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 70-mm left adrenal gland mass. Laboratory tests revealed a high inflammatory state with the following results: a white blood cell count of 12,400/\u03bcl; C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at 27.9 mg/dL; anemia, coagulopathy, and malnutrition, with hemoglobin at 8.9 g/dl; a prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of 1.49; and albumin levels at 2.1 g/dL. For catecholamines, there was a significant increase in serum noradrenaline (2.5 ng/ml [normal range 0.15\u20130.57]). Serum adrenaline (< 0.01 ng/mL) and dopamine levels (0.04 ng/mL) were almost normal. In addition, serum IL-6 (78.8 pg/mL [normal range < 4]) was elevated, while IL-1\u03b2 (10 pg/mL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1; 1.17 pg/mL) levels were normal, which led us to diagnose an IL-6-producing pheochromocytoma. Laparoscopic left adrenal tumor resection was subsequently scheduled (Table ).\nAfter admission, oral loxoprofen administration was started to control systemic inflammation. We also initiated oral doxazosin, a common preoperative treatment for pheochromocytoma. The surgery was scheduled to take place after approximately 2 months to allow for incremental increases of the doxazosin dose. However, her persistently high inflammatory markers, anemia, malnutrition, and coagulopathy, led us to prepone her surgery. The dosage of doxazosin peaked at 12 mg. We did not reach 16 mg, as initially planned, because there were only 17 days before surgery. Anemia due to continued systemic inflammation was also prominent, and two units of packed red blood cells were administered daily starting 5 days before surgery (Fig. ).\nHer BP was 111/68 mmHg on the day of surgery, HR was 95 beats/min, without arrhythmias, and BT was 37.0 \u00b0C. General anesthesia was performed, and an erector spinae plane block was used for perioperative analgesia. Epidural anesthesia was not performed because of coagulopathy. In addition to the standard monitors, an arterial catheter was placed in the radial artery. General anesthesia was induced with target-controlled infusion (TCI) of an effect-site propofol concentration set at 4.0 \u03bcg/ml, remifentanil 0.4 \u03bcg/kg/min, and rocuronium 50 mg. There were no hemodynamic fluctuations after tracheal intubation. Her BP surged to 146/79 mmHg when she was placed in a head-down position to insert the central venous catheter into the right internal jugular vein. Consequently, phentolamine (2 mg) was immediately administered. Flurbiprofen (50 mg) was administered before the start of surgery. After the start of pneumoperitoneum, the infusion rate of remifentanil was increased to 1.0\u20131.7 \u03bcg/kg/min, with 1 mg of phentolamine administered as appropriate. Meanwhile, her systolic BP was kept around 140 mmHg. During direct tumor manipulation, an increase in BP of 150/70 mmHg and tachycardia of 115 beats/min were observed, which required a bolus infusion of phentolamine (2 mg) for a total of 12 mg. Beta-blocker administration and continuous infusion of phentolamine were not necessary to control hemodynamic fluctuations. After tumor removal, the surgery was completed with a continuous infusion of noradrenaline 0.05\u20130.1 \u03bcg/kg/min. During the operation, the patient\u2019s BT rose to 38.2 \u00b0C without a warmer and quickly dropped to 37 \u00b0C postoperatively. The duration of surgery and anesthesia time were 232 min and 361 min, respectively, with a volume of infusion of 2,200 mL, a blood loss of 50 mL, and a urine output of 1,450 mL (Fig. ).\nPostoperatively, she was transferred to the intensive care unit, and a continuous infusion of 0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min noradrenaline was administered. This was eventually discontinued, and the patient moved to the general ward the next day. On postoperative day (POD) 1, chest radiography was normal without any findings of vascular hyperpermeability. Laboratory tests showed improved inflammatory markers. Further, her noradrenaline and IL-6 levels decreased, which normalized by POD7 (Table ). The patient was discharged with an uneventful postoperative course on POD8.

    "question": "The baby boy was born full-term by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old healthy female mother as a fifth pregnancy. Immediately after birth, the infant cried but displayed no change in skin color, and his Apgar scores were 7 and 9 at one and 5 minutes, respectively. There was no history of a consanguineous marriage between the parents or the presence of a similar disease in the other children of the family or other family members. At birth, his weight was 2850 grams (10\u201350 percentile), height was 50 cm (50 percentile), and his head circumference was 34 cm (50 percentile). In his physical examination, there was no dysmorphic appearance and the other systems were found to be normal. On the postnatal second day, tonic and abnormal jerk-like seizures involving all the extremities were observed. The blood glucose was measured at 32 mg/dL during these seizures. The patient was diagnosed with hypoglycemic convulsion and given phenobarbital, after which he was sent to our clinic and hospitalized. His blood glucose was 32 mg/dL. The patient initially had subtle seizures like pedaling, licking lips, and swallowing which were then followed by generalized tonic convulsions. The patient first received 4 cc/kg intravenous 10% dextrose solution. Upon prolonged apnea and deterioration of his general condition both enteral and parenteral nutrition were started. Hormone tests, carried out to explain his resistant hypoglycemia, yielded normal results. Respiratory ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was required for the pathologic apnea following convulsions. In the meantime, his cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) results were normal. Due to the persistence of the convulsions, midazolam infusion was given. In spite of the maximum dose of midazolam infusion and vitamin B6 supplements, the convulsions continued and levetiracetam was added to the treatment regimen. The urine and blood amino acids, the urine sulphite test, and the serum uric acid were all within normal ranges. Convulsions continued despite the normalization of the blood sugar level and the multiple antiepileptic drugs. Then, an important observation was made. It was observed that the patient was extremely alert to acoustic and tactile stimuli and that these stimuli triggered the convulsions. In the repeated EEG, there was no electroencephalographic abnormality accompanying the seizures triggered by stimuli and no other findings except for movement artefacts. Upon observing that the nasal pillow mask triggered seizures, the diagnosis of hyperekplexia was considered and treatment with clonazepam was started. The midazolam, phenobarbital, and levetiracetam that he had been taking were gradually reduced in dose and stopped. Considering the effects that minimal stimuli had, CPAP was replaced by an oxygen hood for ventilation and stimulating interventions were minimalized. The patient then displayed a significant decrease in the intensity and number of his seizures, started normal breast feeding, had normal blood glucose levels, and had no apnea. Where upon, he was discharged from the hospital with clonazepam treatment. During the 4-month follow-up period, he did not display apnea on the apnea monitor and he did not have any convulsions, only minimum-level contractions. What is the patient's body surface area?

    "question": "An 89-year-old female was transferred to our institution with massive gross hematuria in March 2011. The patient\u2019s medical history included uterine cervical cancer for which surgical treatment was performed at the age of 45 and gastric cancer treated by total gastrectomy at the age of 55. Medical history did not include renal biopsy, renal injury, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or no trauma at the flank region. On admission, blood pressure was 143/67 mmHg, heart rate was 83 beats/min, body temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. On clinical examination, weight was 45 kg, height was 143 cm, and body mass index was 22.0 kg/m2. Inspection of the palpebral conjunctiva revealed evidence of anemia. Blood chemical analyses were shown in Table . A urinalysis revealed urine protein level of 3+, urine occult blood level of 3+, white blood cell count of 10\u201319/HPF, and red blood cell count of >100/HPF. Plain abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed dilated left renal pelvis with high-density contents and hematoma was suspected (Figure A, B). Contrast enhanced CT was not performed because this condition was not considered to have association with renal vascular diseases. Subsequent plain abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed left hydronephrosis and blood retention in the dilated left renal pelvis. No cancer in the renal pelvis or ureter was detected (Figure C).\nDespite conservative treatment with hemostatic agents (carbazochrome sodium sulphate and tranexamic acid), hematuria persisted. Repeated urinary cytology revealed no malignant cells. On day 9 after admission, consciousness deteriorated, systolic blood pressure decreased to 60 mmHg, and a high-grade fever of 39.0\u00b0C developed. Laboratory blood tests revealed a markedly elevated white blood cell count (35,000/\u03bcL), markedly elevated C-reactive protein levels (32.5 mg/dL), and moderate anemia (red blood cell count, 206 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL; hemoglobin, 6.0 g/dL). The patient went into septic and/or hemorrhagic shock. Therefore, fluid and catecholamine infusion, blood transfusion, and antibacterial drugs were rapidly initiated. Consciousness level and circulatory condition gradually improved. Repeated blood culture prior to administration of antibacterial drugs revealed no evidence of bacterial infection. On day 10 after admission, abdominal ultrasonography revealed expansion of hematoma in the left renal pelvis. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT confirmed marked expansion of hematoma in the left renal pelvis and identified microaneurysms in the segmental arteries of the left kidney (Figure A, B).\nInflammation improved and a left double-J stent was inserted to improve hydronephrosis. Selective renal angiography that was simultaneously performed revealed renal arteriovenous malformation with microaneurysms in the left segmental arteries (Figure A). Catheter embolization using metallic coils was then successfully performed (Figure ); thus, hematuria ceased. Subsequent plain abdominal CT confirmed the absence of hematoma in the left renal pelvis (Figure A). Abdominal radiography revealed a well-positioned double-J stent (Figure B). The subsequent clinical course was uneventful. No postembolization syndrome (fever, lumbago, elevation of lactase dehydrogenase, or hematuria) was observed. The patient was ambulatory on discharge.

    "question": "A 33-year-old healthy woman (height, 159 cm; weight, 66 kg) underwent her second CS under spinal anesthesia. During the postoperative course, she experienced SM in the lower extremities. There were no preoperative neurological findings in her medical history, and preoperative laboratory examination results, including blood cell count, blood glucose level, and serum electrolyte concentrations, were within the normal range. Intrathecal administration of local anesthetic was performed at the L3/4 level using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (13 mg) without anesthetic premedication. Intermittent administration of ephedrine (at a total dose of 25 mg) was used to maintain the systolic blood pressure above 80 mmHg during the operation. Following the delivery of a healthy baby, droperidol (1.25 mg) was intravenously administered for nausea. Midazolam (2 mg) was also intravenously administered as a sedative at the patient\u2019s request. Upon the completion of CS 67 min after induction of spinal anesthesia, the maximum level of sensory blockade was at the bilateral T2 level. Approximately 130 min after the intrathecal administration of local anesthetic, the patient complained of occasional myoclonic leg jerks in the maternity ward, which gradually increased in frequency and magnitude. The frequency and magnitude of the myoclonus were not constant, ranging from 2 to 30 times per minute. The patient\u2019s pulse rate was 96 bpm, blood pressure was 120/78 mmHg, body temperature was 37.1 \u00b0C, and respiratory rate was 19 bpm, and her consciousness was clear. She presented severe postoperative lower abdominal pain associated with the myoclonic leg jerks; therefore, pentazocine (30 mg) and hydroxyzine (50 mg) were intravenously administered. No movement disorders were observed in the upper extremities. However, sensory perception in her lower extremities was not restored and she was unable to move her legs at will. The severity of the involuntary movements peaked at approximately 3 h after the induction of spinal anesthesia. The patient displayed bicycle-riding-like involuntary movements of the lower extremities; subsequently, these gradually decreased without treatments, and the sensation and voluntary movements in the lower extremities recovered. Approximately 5 h after the intrathecal administration of local anesthetic, the involuntary movements had almost disappeared. On postoperative day (POD) 1, neurological findings such as signs of meningitis, high fever, nuchal rigidity, impaired consciousness, or convulsions were absent. The patient was discharged on POD 8.\nThe patient underwent CS on three occasions. The first CS was at the age of 29 years and was performed under a combination of spinal and epidural anesthesia. Following placement of an epidural catheter at the T11/12 level, spinal anesthesia was performed at the L3/4 level using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (8.5 mg) and fentanyl (20 \u03bcg). Patient-controlled epidural analgesia was induced at a rate of 4 mL/h with 300 mL of 0.14% ropivacaine containing fentanyl (1.5 mg) and droperidol (7.5 mg). The third CS occurred at the age of 35 years and spinal anesthesia was performed at the L3/4 level using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (11.5 mg) and fentanyl (15 \u03bcg). Following delivery of a healthy baby, droperidol (1.25 mg) was intravenously administered for nausea. At the end of the CS, the maximum level of sensory blockade was at the bilateral T2 level. No postoperative neurological events occurred during the first or third CS. What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m\u00b2.",

    "question": "A 49-year-old Japanese man visited our department in November 2017 with chief complaints of indolent right scrotum enlargement and a right inguinal mass. History showed that the patient visited our department of gastroenterology with chief complaints of blackish feces and ill complexion in February 1997. Gastrointestinal fiberscopy was used to treat duodenal ulcer bleeding. Computed tomography (CT) showed a right retroperitoneal tumor, which was removed in the same month.\nHistopathological examination showed a teratoma and yolk sac tumor (Fig. ). He was diagnosed with primary retroperitoneal EGCT and underwent three courses of chemotherapy (bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin; BEP) starting in May 1997. He was closely followed using procedures including periodic imaging, tumor markers determination, and self-palpation.\nHe was followed up on an outpatient basis 5 years after treatment and was subsequently lost to follow-up. In August 1999, he underwent surgery of the right hydrocele. At that time, perioperative findings were unremarkable, indicating no clear tumor in either testicle.\nAt the first visit, his height was found to be 163 cm, and weight was 58.5 kg.\nBlood pressure was 128/78 mmHg, heart rate was regular at 62 beats per minute, and body temperature was 36.4 \u00b0C.\nHe had no history of smoking or drinking, and there was nothing remarkable in the family history.\nOn physical examination, the right testicle was found to be elastic, hard, and enlarged to the size of 40 \u00d7 40 mm. A 45 \u00d7 40 mm sized induration was palpable in the right inguinal area and was adequately mobile. Neurological examination showed no abnormal findings. Blood biochemistry examination, urinalysis, and tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) showed no abnormal findings.\nUltrasound findings showed a mosaic shadow inside the right testicle, with no abnormal findings in the left testicle.\nDuring other diagnostic imaging procedures, enlargements of the right external iliac lymph node (24 \u00d7 14 mm) and right inguinal lymph node (43 \u00d7 29 mm) and a 31 \u00d7 22 mm mass with uneven contents were found in the right testicle (Fig. ). There was no evidence of any distant metastasis.\nFor the right testicular tumor, the patient underwent high orchiectomy and resection of the right inguinal lymph nodes in November 2017. The testicular tumor was 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 30 mm in size and weighed 34 g. The lymph node was 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 30 mm in size and weighed 21 g. The cut surfaces of both specimens were yellowish and solid, and the testicular tumor was localized in the testicle (Fig. ).\nHistopathological findings showed irregular cobblestone proliferations of germ cell-like atypical cells with clear nucleoli and massive necrotic changes that partially resulted from self-destruction. The tumor did not extend into the tunica albuginea, and no vascular infiltration was found. Spermatic cord stumps were negative. Tumor diagnosis was a classical seminoma with no other elements. Lymph node metastases were also diagnosed as a result of the seminoma (Fig. ).\nBased on the above findings, this seminoma was diagnosed as pT1, pN2, M0, S0, and TNM stage IIB [].\nThe patient received postoperative chemotherapy with one course of BEP therapy and three courses of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) therapy at the Japan Community Health care Organization Kani Tono Hospital starting in January 2018.\nPost-chemotherapy CT confirmed a complete clinical response (cCR) at the right external iliac lymph node, and this response continued 12 months later (Fig. ).

She was born of non-consanguineous parents after a normal full term vaginal delivery. She reported no family or personal history of autoimmune diseases. She had no history of trauma and she did not have a history of receiving glucocorticoids.\nThere were no abnormal findings on clinical examination, she was normally pigmented, blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg with no postural fall, and she had normal body hair. Her height was 170 cm and her weight was 53 kg. Thyroid palpation was normal. She had normal pubertal development. Her menarche started at the age of 12 years and she had regular periods. She had no galactorrhea. She had no headaches, visual disturbances, polyuria, or polydipsia.\nBlood examinations showed natremia of 138 mEq/L, kaliemia of 4.1 mmol/L, calcemiaof 2.38 mmol/L, plasma glucose of 4.3 mmol/L and normal blood cell count.\nClinical findings led us to consider the possibility of adrenocortical insufficiency, and the patient underwent detailed endocrine investigations, the results of which are shown in .\nCortisol deficiency was shown clearly by both insulin-induced hypoglycemia and depot Synacthen test [intravenous injection (IV), 1\u03bcg]. Secondary hypoadrenalism was confirmed by the finding of low basal ACTH level (13.8 pg/mL, reference range: 10.3-48.3), at which the plasma cortisol was 34 ng/mL. Prolactin level was elevated at 39 ng/mL (Normal range: 5-29 ng/mL in females). She had normal growth hormone levels concomitant to hypoglycemia. In contrast, basal concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and free thyroxine (FT4) were normal. These results excluded panhypopituitarism and led us to diagnose the patient with IAD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamus and pituitary showed a normal-sized pituitary (pituitary height 6 mm), with no mass lesion. Thepituitary stalk has a normal thickness of 2 mm and was not deviated. Thehyperintense signal of the posterior pituitary was in the normal location.\nThe diagnosis of IAD probably secondary to LYH was made. Investigation for autoimmune diseases, including assessment of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO), anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-TG), anti-ovarian antibodies, anti-adrenal antibodies, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies, and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) was negative.\nA daily dose of hydrocortisone (25 mg) was administered.

    "question": "In November 2014, a 67-year-old male (height, 163 cm; weight, 44 kg) presented with epigastralgia, anorexia, and excessive weight loss (10 kg per month). Endoscopic studies revealed multiple small ulcers extending from the cardiac to the pyloric region and an irregular shaped ulcer in the angular region of the stomach; however, a biopsy was not performed and the patient was treated with a histamine H2-receptor antagonist. Two months later, the patient presented at our clinic with a high fever, epigastralgia, diarrhea, and continuous anorexia. On admission, the patient was neither anemic nor icteric. No lymphadenopathy was noted. The blood test results are summarized in . A second endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed several ulcers at the esophagogastric junction of the lower esophagus. The gastric mucosa was edematous and reddish, and multiple ulcers were found in the corpus, angular region and in the greater curvature of the stomach. These results indicated an increase in both the number and size of the ulcers. Biopsies from these lesions showed inflammatory cell infiltrates associated with typical CMV intranuclear inclusion bodies, suggesting the presence of esophagogastric CMV infection (Figures and ). We found it interesting that the patient was negative for CMV-IgM but was positive for CMV antigenemia. Colonoscopy identified two small ulcers in the terminal ileum and a large ulcer (3 cm) in the ileocecal valve. Histopathology of the biopsied tissues revealed CMV infection in the ileum and cecum (data not shown). Although the patient was initially suspected of having Beh\u00e7et's disease, he was screened for immunodeficiency due to the opportunistic CMV gastroenteritis. The results revealed that the patient was HTLV-1-positive, with a high titer of anti-HTLV-1 antibodies (1 : 1024). He was HIV-negative. A blood smear was carefully reexamined and abnormal lymphocytes with bizarre, convoluted nuclei were identified, although these were not the flower cells typically observed in cases of HTLV-1 infection () []. An extremely high CD4+CD25+ T cell count in peripheral blood was identified by flow cytometry (). The patient was finally diagnosed with smoldering ATL. Initial treatment for Beh\u00e7et's disease (mesalazine, 1.0 g, 3 times per day) and infliximab (one 300 mg infusion) was changed to ganciclovir (250 mg, twice per day for 14 days) to treat CMV gastroenteritis, which significantly improved CMV antigenemia. However, high fever continued to be unresponsive to prednisolone (maximum 30 mg/day) and intravenous immunoglobulin (5 g/day for 5 days).

    "question": "A 51-year-old male patient was referred to Asan Medical Center on August 10, 2005 for a rectal NET that was found incidentally on screening colonoscopy. The patient had undergone hemorrhoidectomy in his twenties, but otherwise had no significant past medical history. He was a non-smoker and non-drinker. His height and weight were 164 cm and 59.3 kg, respectively. His initial vital signs included a blood pressure of 116/74 mmHg, pulse of 84 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute, and body temperature of 36.6\u2103.\nPhysical examination revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory data and the results of urinalysis and stool examination were all within normal limits. Chest and abdominal radiography were also unremarkable. Colonoscopy revealed a 5-mm-sized subepithelial tumor in the rectum, 5 cm above the anal verge; histological analysis of a forceps biopsy specimen revealed a rectal NET that was positive for both synaptophysin and chromogranin. Abdominopelvic CT showed no definite rectal lesions, but did reveal a 7-mm-sized perirectal lymph node. Considering the small size of the lymph node and the rare incidence of small metastatic rectal NETs, the malignant potential of the perirectal lymph node was regarded as very low. We discussed the CT findings with the patient, and finally decided to first remove the primary rectal NET endoscopically, with more invasive surgery to be considered if histological analysis revealed any other unfavorable findings, such as lymphovascular invasion, \u22652 mitoses per 50 high-power fields, and/or Ki-67 index >2%.\nEndoscopic mucosal resection was performed (). The tumor measured 8\u00d75\u00d75 mm, and the vertical resection margin was positive. The tumor involved the mucosa and submucosa without angioinvasion. The Ki-67 index was 0.8%. Hence, the lesion was diagnosed as a well-differentiated grade 1 NET (). Given the favorable histological results of the resected specimen, we considered metastasis to the perirectal lymph nodes to be extremely unlikely; thus, we elected to follow-up the patient using endoscopy (annual sigmoidoscopy for the first 3 years, then colonoscopy every 3 years) and annual abdominopelvic CT.\nFor up to 7 years after endoscopic resection, the size of the perirectal lymph node remained unchanged on CT, and no intraluminal recurrence was identified on serial endoscopic follow-up examinations. However, 7 years after the resection, the lymph node was found to have enlarged slightly, from 7 to 10 mm (), although colonoscopy revealed no evidence of recurrence in the rectum. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed on the perirectal lymph node, and histological analysis revealed a well-differentiated NET. Preoperative MRI showed two perirectal lymph nodes suspicious for metastasis. Laparoscopic low anterior resection and lymph node dissection were also performed. The surgical specimen contained two metastatic lymph nodes, measuring 10\u00d78\u00d78 mm and 6\u00d75\u00d75 mm, respectively. Although lymphovascular and perineural invasion were present, the resection margins were clear. The specimen was positive for synaptophysin, but negative for chromogranin. The Ki-67 labeling index was \u22642%, but no mitosis was noted. Finally, the surgical specimen was diagnosed as a metastatic, well-differentiated, grade 1 NET (). The patient was discharged without complications and was scheduled to continue to receive follow-up examinations on a regular basis. What is the patient's body surface area?

White blood cell count, platelet count and urine production were normal. The ferritin levels remained >1000 ng/ml (100 \u03bcg/dl) during the entire ICU stay. Albumin was 2.9 g/dl. In the following 3 days, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved to around 150 mm Hg. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio dropped from 152 on day 5 to 84 mm Hg on day 6. CRP was increased to 22.9, and the KL-6 was increased to 762 U/ml. The patient was put in prone position and given muscle relaxants. Continuous intravenous lidocaine of 0.6 ml/kg/h was started. Albumin was 1.8 g/dl. On day 7, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased to 128 mm Hg, CRP dropped to 10.3 mg/mL and the lidocaine plasma concentration was 2.2 \u03bcg/ml. From day 3 until discharge from the ICU, D-dimer values were elevated reaching 75 nM/L on day 14. On day 8, although the PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved from 84 to 125 mm Hg, the mechanical ventilatory strategies were exhausted, and the patient was put on ECMO. The KL-6 was increased to 845 U/L, and lidocaine plasma level was 2.9 \u03bcg/ml. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved to 238 mm Hg on day 9, but on day 10, a sharp drop of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio to 60 mm Hg was observed, and CRP was 2.0 mg/ml. The patient\u2019s ARDS status had changed from moderate to severe according to the Berlin ARDS criteria []. Lidocaine treatment was switched from continuous intravenous to continuous subdermal (dosage: 1 mg/kg/h). On day 14, the lidocaine plasma level was 2.7 \u03bcg/ml. KL-6 dropped to 549 U/l. On day 17, the clinical condition of the patient was improving, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio reached 158 mm Hg. The patient was weaned from ECMO. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved further reaching 291 mm Hg on day 21, and the patient\u2019s ARDS status has changed from moderate to mild ARDS []. On day 22, mechanical ventilation was discontinued, and the patient was extubated. The patient was orientated, and no signs of confusion were detected. CT scan on day 25 showed persistent ground glass opacities in both lungs, some pulmonary effusion (right >left), and no signs of vascular thrombosis. In addition, no signs of deep venous thrombosis were found in the lower extremities. Lidocaine treatment was continued until discharge from the ICU on day 30. No new ECG changes were observed during treatment with lidocaine. Blood metHb were within the normal range (0.1\u20130.6%). The patient was discharged home on day 37. At 3 months after admission, the patient is doing well. What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m\u00b2.",

    "question": "A 43-year-old man (weight, 60.0 kg; height, 171.0 cm; body mass index, 20.5 kg/m2) was admitted to our hepatopancreatobiliary surgery department, an asymptomatic 14.0-cm mass in the right liver was diagnosed by ultrasound. The patient was infected by chronic HBV 20 years proir. The \u03b1-FP level was 1,000.00 ng/mL and the liver function was normal (Child-pugh A). CT scan showed that the liver was cirrhotic with a huge lesion in the right liver, which was considered as hepatocellular carcinoma, and a small lesion in the left liver was a typical hemangioma (). The FLR volume was calculated to be 356.0 cm3 (29.1% of 1,223.3 cm3 of the stander liver volume) based on the preoperative CT scan. It is reported that an FLR >30% of the stander liver volume is considered as a safe scope for hepatoectomy []. However, our criteria is FLR >45% of the stander liver volume for patients with cirrhosis. Given the high risk of postoperative liver failure for the patient, a 2-stage surgery should be adopted to increase the FLR. Although compared with portal vein embolization, ALPPS provides a better chance of complete resection for patients with primarily unresectable liver tumor, the morbidity from ALPPS was very high []. Thus, we decided to perform an AMAPS (a modified ALPPS) for this patient.\nIn the first stage of operation, abdominal laparotomy was performed under general anesthesia. After abdominal exploration and cholecystectomy, the right hepatic pedicle was dissected carefully, and the right hepatic artery was isolated and tagged with the homemade rubber strip, which also reduced adhesion around the right hepatic artery by the large flat area. Then, the right portal vein was freed and ligated (). After the falciform ligament was divided, the future transection plane was marked with ultrasound guiding. The microwave antenna, which was guided by ultrasound, was inserted into the liver parenchyma on the right future transection plane, setting a 4-minute and 70 watts output cycle (). This manner was repeated step by step every 2.5 cm to create an avascular groove along the future transection plane.\nThe duration of the first-stage operation was 210 minutes with a blood loss of 100 mL with no need for blood transfusion or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The postoperative FLR was re-evaluated by CT scan weekly. The FLR was estimated at 430.6 cm3 (35.2% of the stander liver volume) after 1 week, and was increased to 500.3 cm3 (40.9% of the stander liver volume) after 2 weeks. On postoperative day 20, the volume of left hepatic was increased to 626.3 cm3 (51.2% of the stander liver volume; FLR increase 75.9%; daily FLR increase 13.5 cm3/day), without any metastatic tumors ().\nThe second-stage operation was performed 21 days after the first-stage operation. Little adhesion was found during the laparotomy. The right hepatic artery was easily identified and divided through the homemade rubber tag. The right portal vein was found below the right hepatic artery and was divided. Then, a bloodless blunt liver resection was performed along the future transaction plane with an anterior approach (). The right biliary duct was indentified and sutured during the parenchymal transection. The median and right hepatic veins were divided and sutured last.\nThe duration of the second-stage operation was 100 minutes with a blood loss of 200 mL, and there was no need for blood transfusion or ICU admission. The result of pathology demonstrated a hepatocellular carcinoma with poor differentiation, and the resection margin was tumor-free (R0). The patient recovered without any complications and was discharged on postoperative day 7. No tumor relapse or metastasis was detected (), and the \u03b1-fetoprotein level was normal at three months after the surgery. What is the patient's body surface area?

    "question": "A 25-year-old woman complained of continuous pain in the right fifth finger, which\nhad started a few months previously without preceding trauma. She was a caregiver\nand had belonged to a rowing club in her college days. The patient\u2019s history was not\nobtained at the first consultation in our hospital. Physical examination revealed a\nJapanese woman of normal intelligence who looked androgynous and muscular. Her\nheight was 166 cm and weight 53 kg. Movement of her fifth finger was associated with\nmild pain. Swelling or numbness was not observed. Her hands and feet were large as\nobserved in acromegaly. Her facial features were exaggerated due to prominence of\nthe mandibular bone. Hyperpigmentation was also observed. On radiographs, a lytic\nbone lesion without calcification was observed in the fifth middle phalanx\naccompanied by mild adjacent joint space narrowing and subchondral bone sclerosis\n(). Enchondroma\nwas suspected first and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. On MRI of\nthe right hand, bone marrow showed diffuse intermediate signal intensity (iso-signal\nintensity to muscles) on T1-weighted (T1W) images and very high signal intensity on\nT2-weighted (T2W) and STIR images (). On fat image with the DIXON method, an almost total lack of\nsubcutaneous and bone marrow fat was evident. The lytic lesion detected on\nradiograph showed a similar signal to that of the surrounding bone marrow in all\nsequences. Conditions showing serous bone marrow were suspected from the imaging\nfindings, and the patient\u2019s history and medication history were taken.\nThe patient had been diagnosed with CGL since birth and genetically diagnosed as\nhaving seipin-linked CGL2 when she was 15 years, when she started leptin replacement\ntherapy. One of her two younger brothers was also diagnosed with CGL. Laboratory\ntests showed mild elevation of AST/ALT and HbA1c of 7.8%, with other parameters\nwithin the respective normal ranges.\nBone survey was performed. Background bone mineral density was increased. Multiple\nosteolytic lesions were noted in the bilateral phalanxes and metacarpal bones in\nhands (), and\nbilateral first to fifth metatarsal bones, phalanges, and navicular bones in the\nfeet (). Most of the\nlytic lesions were located adjacent to subchondral bone. The lesions in the right\nsecond, fifth, and left fifth intermediate phalanxes were accompanied by adjacent\njoint space narrowing and subchondral bone sclerosis with or without geode\nformation. Multiple epiphyseal osteolytic changes with coarsening of trabeculae were\nalso observed. There was a tendency in the feet to show honeycomb-like osteolytic\nlesions. Multiple osteopoikilosis-like patchy sclerotic lesions were also observed\nin the bilateral first metacarpal bones, third middle phalanxes, and left distal\nradius. Enlargement of maxillary sinuses and prognathism with gaps between the teeth\nwas observed on the skull. Sella tunica was not enlarged. Coxa profunda was observed\nin the bilateral hip joint. Other long tubular bones, spine, and pelvic bones showed\nno obvious lytic or sclerotic lesion. Computed tomography (CT) of the right hand\nalso showed multiple lytic and sclerotic lesions without evident fracture or\nperiosteal reaction. The whole-body MRI performed 10 years ago when she was\ndiagnosed with seipin-linked CGL type 2 was reviewed. The study showed almost a\ntotal lack of fat tissue, with only a small amount of fat preserved in the\nretro-orbital, axillar, sole, and palmar regions (). Observation was selected due to the\npatient\u2019s poorly controlled diabetes, although curettage would normally be\nundertaken for management of painful lytic lesions in a young active woman because\nof concern about impending fracture.

    "question": "In July 2014, a 95-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital with a 3-month history of bilateral edema of the lower extremities. When she developed chronic diarrhea at 90 years of age (in 2009), laboratory tests revealed that serum creatinine (Cre) was 1.6 mg/dl, albumin was 3.2 g/dl, and urinary protein excretion was 0.32 g/day.\nShe had no history of smoking, alcohol intake, or malignancy. On admission, she was 153 cm tall and weighed 56.4 kg. Her blood pressure was 138/70 mm Hg. There were bilateral edema of the lower extremities.\nLaboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 4,600/\u03bcl, a red blood cell count of 3.71\u00d7106/\u03bcl, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dl, and platelet count of 21.3\u00d7104/\u03bcl. In addition, total protein was 6.3 g/dl, albumin was 2.4 g/dl, serum urea nitrogen was 26 mg/dl, serum Cre was 1.55 mg/dl, C-reactive protein was 1.6 mg/dl, and lactate dehydrogenase was 257 IU/l (normal: 119-229 IU/l). Immunological tests showed that antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and U1-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibody were all negative. IgG was 1,340 mg/dl, IgA was 427 g/dl, and IgM was 266 mg/dl. The serum level of C3 was 123 mg/dl (normal: >86 mg/dl), C4 was 19 mg/dl (normal: >18 mg/dl), and CH50 was 38 U/ml (normal: >30 U/ml). The patient was negative for hepatitis B virus antibody, hepatitis C virus antibody, and Treponema antigen. Urinary protein excretion was 9.1 g/day, and the sediment contained 5-10 erythrocytes per high-power field. Urinary Bence Jones protein was negative by immunofixation electrophoresis.\nNo findings suggestive of malignancy were revealed by imaging studies such as computed tomography and ultrasonography. The long axis of the kidney was calculated to be 9.0 cm bilaterally. Serum anti-PLA2R autoantibody was positive according to the method of Akiyama et al. []. Renal biopsy was done to evaluate the renal changes in this patient.\nLight microscopy of a renal biopsy specimen containing 36 glomeruli revealed global sclerosis in 22 of them (fig. ). The other 13 glomeruli showed mild mesangial matrix expansion (fig. ), but there was no definite spike formation, bubbling, or thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (fig. ). In the tubulointerstitial region, atrophy or fibrosis affected 50-60% of the cortical tissue (fig. ). The arterioles displayed mild to moderate hyalinosis (fig. ), while the interlobular arteries showed mild to moderate fibroelastic intimal thickening (fig. ). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the GBM. Analysis of IgG subclasses revealed dominant staining for IgG4 (IgG4 > IgG1 > IgG3 > IgG2; fig. ), while staining for IgA and IgM was very weak. The anti-PLA2R binding in the biopsy was positive. Congo red staining was negative. Electron microscopy showed subepithelial electron-dense deposits (EDD) in the GBM, but these subepithelial EDD were not associated with spike-like protrusions arising from the basement membrane (fig. ). Stage 1 MGN was diagnosed due to these findings.\nAnasarca was treated with diuretics (furosemide at 80 mg daily) and dietary restriction (6 g of salt and 700 ml of water daily), achieving weight loss from 56.4 to 51.0 kg. Because the patient did not want steroid therapy due to adverse effects such as bone disease, cyclosporin microemulsion (Neoral at 50 mg daily) was added, and the level at 2 h after administration was titrated in the range of 600-1,000 ng/ml. However, proteinuria persisted, and renal function deteriorated rapidly. Hemodialysis was started when Cre was 6.0 mg/dl and urea nitrogen was 102 mg/dl because of exacerbation of pleural effusion and generalized edema along with an increase in weight to 58 kg at 2 months after diagnosis.

    "question": "A 70-year-old Japanese man without any major family and psychosocial history was referred to our hospital to continue treatment for DME. At the patient\u2019s former hospital, his major symptom was repeated visual disturbance of both eyes due to DME, and he received sub-Tenon\u2019s triamcinolone acetonide injection and intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. Sub-Tenon\u2019s triamcinolone acetonide injections were once in both eyes, and intravitreal anti-VEGF injections were 12 times in both eyes every 2\u20133 months (4 times with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 7 times with 2 mg aflibercept in the right eye and once with aflibercept in the left eye) during the 2.5-year follow-up period. At the patient\u2019s former hospital, the last anti-VEGF therapies were injected in the left eye in July 2016 and the right eye in December 2016.\nAt the patient\u2019s first visit to our hospital in January 2017, his body height and weight was 160 cm and 52 kg [body mass index (BMI) 20.3], respectively. His HbA1c level was 6.3 %, and he has been suffering from diabetes mellitus for 10 years with only diet therapy. His blood pressure was 120/61 mmHg, and he had no hypertension. Although he had hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 244 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 148 mg/dl), he did not receive any pharmacological treatments for it. He has been treated with donepezil hydrochloride for mild cognitive impairment in the neurology department of Tokyo Takanawa Hospital. However, because he works regularly and can attend a hospital by himself, he has no hindrance to daily life. In addition, there was no issue on financial and language/cultural challenges. A dilated fundus examination showed mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy [], with several small hemorrhages without macular edema, and his best corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in both eyes. The central subfield macular thickness (CMT) on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was 279/320 \u03bcm (right eye/left eye).\nFive months later, he noticed blurred vision in both eyes (visual acuity was 0.8 in both eyes), and a fundus examination showed significant macular edema in both eyes (CMT, 404/478 \u03bcm). In June 2017, for the first time at our hospital, the patient received 2-mg intravitreal aflibercept injections in both eyes 1 week apart (6 June in the right eye and 13 June in the left eye). No laser therapy was applied. After short-term anti-VEGF therapies to both eyes, his systemic condition remained the same. The treatment was effective in both eyes, and 1 month later, his CMT recovered to 277/321 \u03bcm, and his blurred vision disappeared (visual acuity was 1.0 in right eye and 1.2 in left eye). Three months after the first treatment at our hospital (1 September 2017), significant macular edema relapsed in both eyes (CMT, 403/463 \u03bcm; Fig. ), visual acuity was 0.8 in right eye and 1.0 in left eye, and he desired continuous treatment for both eyes. In October 2017, he received intravitreal aflibercept injections in both eyes 1 week apart (3 October in the right eye and 10 October in the left eye). One month after treatment (10 November), his subjective complaint of blurred vision disappeared (0.8 in right eye and 1.2 in left eye), and the CMT decreased to 280/315 \u03bcm (Fig. ). During this period, his HbA1c levels were measured and kept at 6.5% (3 October, 10 October, and 10 November).\nUpon initiating the intravitreal injection in the operating room, we measured his blood pressure as 141/69 mmHg (3 October) and 135/70 mmHg (10 October) without blood-pressure-lowering drugs (Fig. a). However, on 12 November, just 2 days after a follow-up visit to our hospital, he complained of a severe headache and walked to the emergency department at Tokyo Takanawa Hospital. He complained of a severe headache on the right back side of his head and visual disturbance of the left visual field with no other systemic neuropathological symptoms. He had no external injury presumed as trauma antecedent and no other apparent causes leading to cerebral hemorrhage. His blood pressure was elevated at 195/108 mmHg, and computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed the presence of a high-density area (2.5 \u00d7 3.0 cm) in the right occipital lobe indicating a subcortical hemorrhage (Fig. a). The patient was treated with an intravenous injection of nicardipine hydrochloride to lower his systemic blood pressure to < 140 mmHg for 2 days. On 13 November, CT showed no enlargement of the high-density area (data not shown). On 15 November, 3 days after the stroke, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a peripheral low-intensity zone in the same region (T2*-weighted MRI, Fig. b) and a low-intensity area (diffusion-weighted MRI, Fig. a) in the occipital lobe that was consistent with the CT results. Additionally, magnetic resonance (MR) angiography revealed no vascular anomalies or malformation (Fig. b), and T2*-weighted MRI revealed no cerebral microbleeds, thus ruling out cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Fig. b). He was therefore diagnosed with a hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage of the occipital lobe. On 14 November, 2 days after the stroke, the patient began oral treatment with 80 mg/day telmisartan, which was continued for 3 days. Starting 17 November, the telmisartan dose was reduced to 40 mg/day. During this period, his blood pressure was maintained at < 130/80 mmHg, and his symptoms of severe headache disappeared, and visual disturbance of the left visual field was alleviated. Ten days later, he was discharged from Tokyo Takanawa Hospital, and 20 days after discharge he visited our hospital to receive a follow-up ophthalmological examination. Two months after the stroke (5 January 2018), visual field tests with Goldmann perimetry at our hospital showed no apparent left homonymous hemianopsia (Fig. ). Follow-up CT (14 February 2018; Fig. c) and T2*-weighted MRI (24 July 2018; Fig. d) examinations revealed that the cerebral hemorrhage had been absorbed, and the lesion had decreased in size. One year after the cerebrovascular stroke, the telmisartan was discontinued because his blood pressure had stabilized to a normal level and remained around 110/60 mmHg.\nThe patient received no anti-VEGF therapy for 4 months prior to 3 October 2017 because his macular edema did not relapse. We happened to determine his plasma VEGF levels before and after the intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (October 2017) via specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (SRL, Tokyo, Japan; Fig. b). The patient\u2019s plasma VEGF level was 28 pg/ml on 3 October, just before the intravitreal injection of aflibercept in the right eye. However, the level rapidly decreased to below the detection limit (< 20 pg/ml) on 10 October, just before the injection in his left eye. Notably, the levels on 10 November (2 days before the cerebral hemorrhage) and 10 December were also below the detection limit. On 25 January 2018, we confirmed that his plasma VEGF level had recovered to 41 pg/ml. Thereafter, we continued to follow the patient for DME and diabetic retinopathy, and no cerebral hemorrhage recurred. What is the patient's body surface area?

    "question": "A 51-year-old gentleman, recently diagnosed to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and systemic hypertension, presented to the cardiology outpatient clinic on 28th July 2016 with history of pricking chest pain and shortness of breath for the past 7 years and recurrent attacks of syncope since the previous year. He weighed 49 kg and with a height of 157 cm; body mass index was 19.88 kg/m2. His blood pressure (BP) was 120/80 mmHg and pulse rate was 78/min and regular in rhythm. He was afebrile. Systemic examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory findings revealed hemoglobin of 15.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 47%, white blood cell count of 11,300/mm3 (differential count of neutrophils of 56%, lymphocytes 26%, eosinophils 11%, and monocytes of 7%), and platelet count of 293,000/mm3. Urine on routine examination showed a pH of 6.0, specific gravity of 1015, and was negative for albumin, glucose, red blood cells, and pus cells. Blood glucose fasting was 115 mg/dL and post-prandial was 219 mg/dL with an HbA1C of 7.1%. Blood urea was 27 mg/dL and creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, and bicarbonate 28 mEq/L. Serum cholesterol was 183 mg/dL, serum triglyceride 121 mg/dL, and serum uric acid 3.9 mg/dl. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular dimensions, no regional wall motion abnormality, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 69%. Holter monitoring showed occasional supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes. On 2nd August, coronary angiography showed insignificant coronary artery disease with dominant right coronary system and he was discharged with medical advice.\nOn 3rd August, he attended emergency department with complaints of severe back pain, palpitation, and sweating. His back pain was sudden in onset, gradually progressive, throbbing type, rating 8/10 in pain scale, radiating to the left flank, aggravated by exertion, and partially relieved by rest. He had no other complaints. He was on metformin and calcium channel blocker. He looked anxious, agitated, and restless but was oriented and afebrile. His pulse rate was 112/min, respiratory rate was 28/min, and BP was 210/120 mmHg in the right upper limb and 210/100 mmHg over the left upper limb in supine position. There was no radio-femoral delay. Systemic examination was unremarkable except for a mild tenderness in the lumbar region.\nOn investigation, electrocardiography, chest X-ray, complete blood counts, liver function tests, 2D echocardiography, urine analysis, and toxicology screen were all within normal limits. Serum amylase and lipase were normal. Blood urea was 58 mg/dL and serum creatinine was 2 mg/dL. Venous blood gas (VBG) analysis showed a pH of 7.21, bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, base excess of \u22129.4 mmol/L, and a lactate of 10.81 mmol/L. Serum electrolytes were sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 108 mmol/L, and anion gap was 12 mmol/L.\nThe following were considered in the differential diagnosis of this situation: (a) acute mesentric ischemia, (b) aortic dissection (c) hypertensive emergency, and (d) pancreatitis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography abdomen showed a lesion in the left adrenal gland measuring about 3.5 \u00d7 3.2 cm with mild enhancement in the arterial phase, features consistent with pheochromocytoma [: Contrast enhanced CT scan of abdomen showing the mildly enhancing left adrenal mass]. No additional extra-adrenal tumors were seen. There was no evidence of mesenteric ischemia, aortic dissection, or pancreatitis. Upon further questioning his family members, it was known that he was unwell in the previous 6 months with on and off headache, palpitation, and anxiousness, which they attributed to the recently diagnosed diabetes mellitus.\nHis BP was managed with alpha adreno-receptor blocker and calcium channel blocker. Phenoxybenzamine was added at a dose of 10 mg twice a day and later increased to 20 mg three times daily. Persistent tachycardia and BP were stabilized with addition of beta blocker.\nOn 5th August 2016, the level of 24-h urine metanephrines was 14,536 mcg (reference range: less than 350 mcg/24 h) and nor-metanephrines was 7,607 mcg (reference range: less than 600 mcg/24 h).\nLaparoscopic removal of pheochromocytoma was done under general anesthesia on 12th August 2016. After the surgery, there was a brief episode of hypoglycemia and hypotension, which was managed with 25% dextrose and normal saline, respectively. Azotemia resolved and blood gases were normalized. Pathological examination of the resected mass revealed a well-encapsulated tumor of size 5 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm, without hemorrhage. It showed polygonal and round cells with abundant cytoplasm and increased vasculature. There was no capsular or vascular invasion. Tumor cells were seen in the background of spindle cells with ganglion cells and Schwanian stroma. These features were reported as consistent with a CP\u2013ganglioneuroma of the left adrenal gland []. Immunohistochemistry examination showed positivity for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 stains and negativity for calretinin in pheochromocytoma cells. Calretinin, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 stains were positive in the ganglioneuromatous component. Vimentin was positive and cytokeratin was negative.

    "question": "A 66-year-old female presented to the emergency department with 1 week duration of general weakness and poor oral intake. She had an underlying disease of diabetes and hypertension for 10 years and had been treated with medications at the local clinic, which included metformin, glimepiride, hydrochlorothiazide, losartan, and atorvastatin. She also had severe osteoarthritis at both knee joints and had multiple steroid injections at the local orthopedic clinic. Approximately 2 weeks before admission, she had been admitted for treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). At that time, blood culture and urine culture showed growth of Escherichia coli and was treated with ceftriaxone and tazobactam. She was not on any antihypertensive medication for 2 weeks.\nPhysical examination showed the following findings: height 152 cm, body weight 57 kg, blood pressure 70/50 mmHg, heart rate 70 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 20 per minute, with body temperature 36.5\u00b0C. Decreased skin and tongue turgor were observed. Pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable.\nshows the laboratory data at admission and those 2 weeks before admission. Her outpatient laboratory data checked at 2 weeks prior to admission showed normal levels of serum creatinine and calcium. Serum magnesium level decreased to a lower limit of normal range at admission. Fractional excretion of sodium was 1.0%.\nHaving pyuria and hypotension, with a previous history of UTI, she was first diagnosed as UTI sepsis. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and antibiotics and massive hydration (30 mL/kg of crystalloids) were administered. The patient\u2019s vital signs were stabilized after administration of crystalloids. Within 2 days, inflammatory signs and blood pressure were normalized. However, serum calcium and creatinine levels remained elevated, and the patient constantly complained about poor oral intake and general weakness.\nOn the third hospital day, administration of saline and calcitonin (40 IU per day) was begun. Serum calcium level decreased for the next 2 days (from 11.9 to 9.9 mg/dL) but began to increase again from the third day of calcitonin administration.\nTo evaluate the cause of hypercalcemia, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of chest and abdomen and whole body bone scintigraphy were performed, but the results showed no evidence of malignancy. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titers, and tumor marker studies were negative. Thyroid function profile revealed normal levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (0.68 \u03bcIU/L, normal range: 0.34\u20130.56 \u03bcIU/L) and free thyroxine (1.12 ng/dL, normal range: 0.58\u20131.64 ng/dL). The bone mineral density T-score was \u20131.4, which indicated osteopenia. Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was 7.5 pg/mL (normal range: 12\u201388 pg/mL), PTH-related peptide was undetectable (normal range: <1.1 pmol/L), and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D was 16.32 ng/mL (normal range: 30\u2013100 ng/mL). These results indicated a suppressed PTH\u2013vitamin D axis.\nWe found that the patient had multiple steroid injections in both her knee joints in the past, although the amount of steroid could not be quantified. Adrenocortical function was assessed, and showed that her serum cortisol level was 2.36 \u03bcg/dL and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 32.51 pg/mL (normal range: 10\u201360 pg/mL). The ACTH stimulation test showed inadequate cortisol response to the pharmacological dose of ACTH (). As most people with secondary adrenal insufficiency fall within the range limit and usually below 35, the plasma ACTH level and ACTH stimulation test results suggested the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone (1.5 mg/kg) was administered from the tenth hospital day. Her serum calcium level returned to normal within 3 days and her general weakness and anorexia were completely improved (). With the normalization of calcium level, magnesium level trended toward normal range. After 2 weeks of follow-up, serum calcium level was maintained at 8.7 mg/dL. As the patient was at a high risk of developing osteoporosis and needed corticosteroid replacement, regular monitoring for bone mineral density was considered, but the patient was lost for follow-up.

    "question": "A 27-year-old single Saudi woman presented with her parents on September 2016 at the gynecology outpatient clinic of the King Fahad Medical city, Saudi Arabia, with a gradually abdominal distension and discomfort over two years. The swelling was accompanied by vague abdominal pain and breathlessness which worsened on recumbency leading to decreased sleep. She also complained of constipation and poor appetite. There was no history of vomiting or other gastrointestinal symptoms, urinary symptoms, colicky pain, and fainting attacks. She had no previous history of any illnesses, allergies, or operations. She denied the use of any medications. There was no family history of malignancies. Her menarche commenced at the age of 11 years with subsequent regular cycles.\nHer body weight was 71 kg, her height was 157 cm, and her BMI was 28.8. On physical examination, she was afebrile with a pulse rate of 79 b/min, blood pressure of 120/73 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 20 cycles/min. There was no jaundice, edema, or lymphadenopathy. Secondary sexual characteristics were evident. Abdominal examination revealed abdomen was distended with large ill-defined pelvic-abdominal cystic mass extending from pubis to epigastrium with an abdominal girth of 106 cm with a dull note on percussion, without tenderness and the presence of dermal striae. Intestinal sounds were normal. The external genital examination was normal.\nPlain radiograph of the chest (P-A view) was within normal limits. Transabdominal ultrasonography verified a large pelvic cystic mass about 29 \u00d7 18 cm with no evidence of solid components or septations. The uterus was normal and endometrial thickness was 10 mm. CA-125 was 25.3 IU/ml and another tumor marker was within the normal ranges. Abdominopelvic computerized tomography (CT) findings were consistent with a large well-defined homogeneously cystic lesion originating from the right ovary measuring 15.6 \u00d7 26.3 \u00d7 31.7 cm in the AP, transverse, and craniocaudal dimensions, respectively (). Most likely this represents ovarian cystadenoma, with no abdominopelvic metastases or lymphadenopathy. Our patient was counseled and signed informed consent for laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, possible oophorectomy, and laparotomy if needed.\nIntraoperatively, the patient was in a supine position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The bladder had been drained with a Foley catheter that was placed in the bladder. Attention was then turned to the abdomen where an approximately 10 mm skin incision was made in the umbilical fold. Entry into the peritoneum was done using the Hasson technique. The 10 mm trocar was placed through the umbilical incision. The abdominal cavity was visualized with huge cyst arising from the right ovary which was seen, extending up to the level of the xiphoid process, and the liver was not visualized due to the huge cyst. Peritoneal wash was sent for cytology. The 10 mm second trocar was applied in the suprapubic catheter with direct opening in the cyst and being drained around 10,050 ml. However, with suction, a large globular piece of the cyst was obtained that appeared to be coagulated blood which was sent for cytology. Two trocars 5 mm were inserted in the lower quadrant bilaterally. The cyst wall was identified and was removed using blunt dissection with countertraction. The ovarian bed was then irrigated and dried. There was slight oozing noted near the edge of the ovary, with hemostasis obtained using electrocautery. The Endo Catch bag was placed through the 10 mm port (suprapubic) and the cyst wall components, and the right ovarian cyst was placed in the Endo Catch bag and removed through the 10 mm incision which was sent for histopathology (). After decompression of the ovarian cyst, the liver and the gallbladder were seen with no abnormality. The uterus and the left ovary were looking normal. Lymph nodes were not enlarged. The pelvis was copiously irrigated and dried. Hemostasis was assured. Operative time was 155 minutes. Estimated blood loss was minimal. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Total excised cyst measured 31 cm in size and 550 grams by weight (). Total volume of the cyst was calculated to approximately 11 kg. The postoperative period was uneventful.\nShe was discharged on the 2nd postoperative day. The patient was advised to follow up after 4 weeks. Patient weighed 60 kg with an abdominal girth of 80 cm on day 28 after operation. Cytological examinations were negative for malignancy. Histopathological examination revealed serous cystadenoma of the ovary. She recovered completely from her surgery and has gone back to her normal daily activity.

    "question": "A 77-year-old woman visited a local clinic because of persistent cough for the past 6 months. A tracheal tumor was suspected on imaging and she was referred to us for further evaluation and treatment. Her medical history included hypertension and atrial fibrillation, for which she was treated with medications. Her height was 156 cm and weight was 56 kg. Respiratory noise was audible on respiration. There was no enlargement of surface lymph nodes. Additionally, there were no abnormalities in blood biochemistry and tumor marker levels were normal. Radiography showed a mass in the trachea. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings revealed a 1.5 cm large border and a smooth surface nodule shadow on the posterior wall of the thoracic trachea approximately 5 cm below the glottis. Mass formation with a major axis of 1.0 cm in diameter extending from the trachea to the esophagus was observed. Based on MRI findings, the border with the surrounding organs was clear and it was diagnosed as primary tracheal tumor invasion (Fig. a, b) Furthermore, bronchoscopy showed a smooth-surfaced submucosal tumor with abundant neovessels, which accounted for 80% of the cross-sectional area of the trachea (Fig. ). Biopsy was not performed, because there was a strong possibility of airway obstruction due to bleeding. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed accumulation with a maximum standardized uptake value of 2.9 for the lesion and the possibility of malignancy could not be excluded (Fig. ). The patient was not in a state of respiratory distress and tumor resection using a bronchoscope was at risk of bleeding, we decided to remove the tumor by tracheal sleeve resection, because the patient had symptoms and was at risk of airway obstruction. Regarding anesthesia, the percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) was put on standby in consideration of the possibility of suffocation due to intubation difficulties and bleeding during intubation. There were no problems during anesthesia except for the operation of the intubation tube. Surgery was performed via median sternotomy. The thymus and surrounding structures were separated to expose the trachea, and then five tracheal rings, including the tumor, were removed by sleeve resection. Separation from the esophagus was relatively easy. After resection of the trachea, the airway was secured by intubation. End-to-end anastomosis of the trachea was performed using 3-0 monofilament synthetic absorbable suture material. A continuous suture was initiated in the membranous portion. The orally inserted tracheal tube was then advanced to the distal portion to secure the airway and interrupted suture of the portion of the tracheal cartilage was performed. The anastomosis site was covered with the thymus (Fig. ). Five tracheal rings were excised for excision of one or more tracheal rings above and below the tumor. Based on the results of intraoperative pathology, it was judged that there was no tendency for tumor infiltration and additional resection was not performed. The postoperative course was favorable. There has been no recurrence for 2 years after surgery. The resected specimen showed a white\u2013pink tumor (maximum diameter of 23 mm) protruding into the tracheal lumen and the membranous portion (Fig. ). Pathological examination showed a mass of hyperplastic atypical cells with spindle-shaped nuclei arranged in bundles running in various directions in the submucosa. On immunostaining, the tumor was positive for vimentin, CD34, and Bcl-2, and negative for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Based on these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as an SFT (Fig. , ). There were no malignant findings and the resected stump was negative. The postoperative course was favorable and there has been no evidence of recurrence for 2 years after the surgery. What is the patient's body surface area?

    "question": "A 7.5-year-old boy presented to the Department of Endocrinology with symptoms of virilisation (presence of pubic hair, enlargement of penis), acne and adult body odour.\nOur patient was born after a full-term, unremarkable pregnancy and exhibited normal development until the age of 5 years. At the age of 5.5 years, the first symptoms of virilisation started to appear (pubic hair and enlargement of penis) as well as acceleration of growth velocity. On admission to the Endocrinology Department, on physical examination the patient was found to have pubic hair (Tanner stage III/IV), a large penis measuring around 6 cm. His height was 144 cm (+3.25SD) with a weight 28.1 kg (5\u201310 centile according to the height) , a growth spurt was diagnosed (growth velocity 9 cm/year), his bone age was two years advanced. There was acne limited to the region of his face and adult body odour but no axillary hair and no striae. Testicular size (2 ml each) and structure were normal for age. Moreover, neurologic examination revealed that the patient had difficulty in walking (he walked on his toes), increased leg reflexes and right site foot-clonus. His bowel and bladder function were normal as well his sensation.\nLaboratory investigations revealed significantly raised serum androgen levels (Table ), abnormally high concentrations of androgen metabolites in the urine steroid profile that were suggestive of a virilising tumour; and normal cortisol and ACTH levels.\nThere was no androgen suppression observed during the 4-day Dexamethasone test (2 days of 2 mg/d, 2 days of 8 mg/d) but normal cortisol suppression after the small dose of Dexamethasone. Urine catecholamine and their metabolites levels were normal.\nThe abdominal and thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan and the adrenal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormalities. The ultrasound of the testes was normal. Adrenal scintigraphy (131 J-norcholesterol) showed no adrenal autonomic function.\nThe brain MRI was normal, however spinal MRI T2- and contrast enhanced T1-weighted images demonstrated an ovoid, well-circumscribed, intradural extramedullary enhancing mass measuring approximately 2.8x2.1x6.0 cm (Fig. ). The mass occupied the entire cross-section of the spinal canal at levels L3 to L4/5 (Fig. ). The presence of myxopapillary ependymoma was suspected.\nThe patient underwent an L3-L4 laminectomy. Upon opening the dura, an extramedullary mass was seen. There were calcifications within the arachnoid. The white-grayish mass measured 3.0x2.0x5.0 cm, appeared well-circumscribed, and showed no invasion of surrounding tissues. The lesion was resected totally.\nMicroscopically features were of benign ectopic adrenocortical tumour (Fig. ). On the IHCM (immunohistochemistry and microscopy) panel the cells were positive for melan-A, locally positive for synaptophisin and for CD56. The cells were negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and chromogranin. The proliferative activity ki67 index was low (locally up to 3 %).\nPostoperative course was uneventful apart from transient urinary bladder function disturbances (difficulty urinating and patient required catheterisation regimen for several weeks). The patient was followed up and the normalization of androgen levels was observed in tests performed 9 days, 2 and 7 months after surgery (Table ). Neurologic examination at 9 month post surgery was normal apart from lack of right Achilles tendon reflex. There were no abnormalities on control MRI of the brain and spine performed 9 months post surgery. Unfortunately secondary to the endocrine activity of the tumour, central precocious puberty occurred and patient started the treatment with long acting LH-RH analogue. The boy is now 10 years of age, his height is 162 cm and bone age is three years advanced.

    "question": "A 77-year-old, Asian male patient (weight: 60 kg, height: 165 cm) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing periodic hemodialysis, was hospitalized due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He had no known history of psychosis prior to admission to the hospital. His social history was positive for alcohol consumption (25 mL a day for 10 years) and smoking (40 cigarettes a day for 30 years).\nOn admission, the patient was conscious and oriented to person, time, and place. Complete neurological examination including mental state was normal. The patient was in shortness of breath with the following vital signs: temperature 36.2 \u00b0C, blood pressure 156/91 mmHg, pulse 98 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20 per minute. He reported progressively worsening cough productive of yellow purulent sputum. Bilateral moist crackles were heard in both lungs on auscultation but with no wheezing. Markers of systemic inflammation were elevated (white blood cell count [WBC] 10.25 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein [CRP] 57.50 mg/L, procalcitonin [PCT] 0.49 ng/mL). Laboratory analysis revealed increased baseline serum creatinine (10.63 mg/dL, estimated creatinine clearance 4.94 mL/min). His liver function was moderately impaired and classified into Child-Pugh class B. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse inflammation and interstitial change and a small amount of pleural effusion in bilateral lungs.\nIntravenous moxifloxacin was initiated 400 mg daily as empiric treatment for pulmonary infection on hospital day 1. A sputum sample was collected for microbiological culture before initiation of antibiotics and the result came back negative. On day 12, the patient was feeling tired and weak with hyperthemia (38.1 \u00b0C), hypertension (184/91 mm Hg), and worsened shortness of breath (26 beats/min). Plasma indicators for infection were elevated (WBC 11.50 \u00d7 109/L, neutrophils 97.1%, PCT 22.10 ng/mL). On the 13th day, moxifloxacin was switched to meropenem 500 mg intravenous every 8 hours. On 16th day, sputum culture revealed multidrug-resistant (MDR) A baumannii (resistant to carbapenem but sensitive to tetracycline). Then intraveous tigecycline was added to the regimen at a loading dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours.\nFourteen hours after tigecycline initiation, the patient became confused, disoriented to location, and the time. He had difficulty understanding instructions and was clearly disturbed in attention during the conversation. He was agitated, fearing that people around him were trying to harm him. Then he became verbally aggressive toward his family members and medical staff. His mental disorder worsened in the next 2 to 3 hours then he began having hallucinations, seeing a huge ball in the ceiling and asking the nurse to take it down so he could eat it. He asked other people to gather together and said he had important things to announce. His Confusion Assessment Method, which is a valid tool for the detection of delirium, was negative prior to the initiation of tigecycline, but became positive after it was started. His clinical manifestations also met the key features listed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-V) criteria from the American Psychiatric Association that characterizes delirium.[\nNo focal neurological disease was noted after neurological examination. A computerized tomographic scan of the head was then performed, and no abnormalities were identified. Oxygen supplementation (4 L/min via nasal cannulae) was initiated after the arterial blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia (pH 7.41; PaCO2 25 mmHg; PaO2 68 mmHg; Na+ 132 mEq/L; K+ 5.5 mEq/L). The patient did not have any prior history of mental illness. Drug-induced delirium was suspected and tigecycline was speculated to be the most likely offending agent after medication review (Table ). Since his delirium was treated with little success with olanzapine, tigecycline therapy was discontinued the next morning after the patient stayed awake the whole night. During the following day after discontinuation of tigecyline, the patient's mental state improved and delirium cleared slowly. He restored the ability of focus and orientation. Perceptual disturbances disappeared, and no visual illusions or vague delusions of harm were noted again.\nMeanwhile, markers of systemic inflammation were elevated (WBC 43.91 \u00d7 109/L, neutrophils 98.2%, PCT 34.04 ng/mL, CRP 89.09 mg/L). On Day 19, antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem (i.v., 500 mg q8 h) combined with minocycline (p.o., 400 mg q12 h), and amikacin (i.v., 200 mg qd). The regimen continued for 5 days but the patient did not respond well, showing even higher systemic inflammation markers and exacerbated dyspnea. Antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem 500 mg every 8 hours, and he started again on tigecycline 50 mg every 12 hours on 24th day with no loading dose.\nIn the morning of Day 25, the patient showed reduced psychomotor activity, decreased speech, but no obvious hallucinations. He had no idea of the time of day, nor where he was, although the day before he was fully orientated. The patient experienced a hypoactive state of delirium. CT examination of the chest showed increased inflammatory pulmonary lesions in bilateral lungs. Blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia without carbon dioxide retention, and the electrolytes were found to be within range. Also, no significant changes in blood profile like levels of liver enzymes or serum creatinine was observed compared with the last test taken before the delirium appeared again. Tigecycline was discontinued and delirium resolved in the afternoon. Antibiotic treatment was then switched to levofloxacin (i.v., 600 mg qd) and minocycline (p.o., 100 mg q12 h). But the patient did not respond well to the present antibiotic therapy and his dyspnea exacerbated. He was transferred to the intensive care unit 6 days later as mechanical ventilation was required. Unfortunately, the patient died of recurrent attacks of left heart failure probably caused by uncontrolled serious infections on 33th day. What is the patient's body surface area?

    "question": "Case 2 is a 30-year-old Japanese man who was transferred to the emergency department with diabetic ketoacidosis and was initially diagnosed with type 1 diabetes three years prior to this study. He has been using different doses and types of insulin since that diagnosis. However, his glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and insulin antibodies were negative (below detectable range). Therefore, this patient has features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, because of his clinical picture, this patient may have non-autoimmune fulminant type 1 diabetes, which is rare in Caucasian populations but comprises approximately 10% of type 1 diabetes cases in Japan []. His endogenous insulin secretory capacity was almost completely lost, since his post-meal C-peptide levels were repeatedly undetectable (below 0.1 ng/ml). His post-meal glucagon level was 107 pg/ml (normal range, 23 to 197 pg/ml). His BMI was 17.5 (body weight/body height = 52 kg/172 cm). His HbA1c level was above 8% in the three months prior to this study. Sitagliptin (50 mg/day) was added to the therapeutic regimen to try to achieve better control of his diabetes. At that time, he was using premixed biphasic insulin aspart (30% insulin aspart and 70% protamine-complexed insulin aspart; Novorapid 30 MIX) three times daily before each meal (15U, 7U and 16U, respectively). He was also taking 625 mg metformin three times daily and 75 mg miglitol three times daily. His post-meal blood glucose level was 242 mg/dl, and his HbA1c level was 8.1% at baseline. In the first month after starting sitagliptin, he had occasional mild hypoglycemia, which he could manage by taking glucose drinks by himself. He had no hypoglycemic events after the second month of sitagliptin therapy. His HbA1c level was followed for 24 weeks and was reduced from 8.1% to 7.1% (1.0% reduction, Figure ). His post-meal C-peptide levels repeatedly remained undetectable (below 0.1 ng/ml) after the start of sitagliptin treatment. No adverse events were observed in kidney or liver function. No weight gain or gastrointestinal complaints were noted. At eight weeks, he could reduce the insulin dose by 2U before each meal. The doses of other drugs remained unchanged. Before and during sitagliptin treatment, no special difference in diet management or physical exercise was noted. What is the patient's body surface area?

    "question": "A 56-year-old man (164 cm, 57 kg) who was previously diagnosed with left Aspergilloma, a tuberculosis destroyed lung, and diabetes mellitus was scheduled for a left pneumonectomy due to recurrence of Aspergilloma in his left lung. As shown in his chest x-ray and chest CT (Figs. and ), his left lung was nearly collapsed, and the result of a pulmonary function test was severely restricted. The patient's diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was 63% and predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 23.5%, suggesting he might require a postoperative mechanical ventilator. However, the patient's preoperative room air saturation was 98% and arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed pH 7.428, pCO2 36.6 mmHg, pO2 98.6 mmHg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L. As the patient's partial oxygen concentration was adequate despite his left lung being nearly totally collapsed, we thought that we would be capable of performing the pneumonectomy using a SLT. The thoracic surgeon also agreed to use a SLT. For a better surgical view, we planned lung isolation via insertion of a SLT deep into the bronchus.\nOn the day of the surgery, routine monitoring was done, including an electrocardiography, a noninvasive blood pressure measuring device, and pulse oximetry. Central venous line and arterial line were placed for better anesthetic care. Midazolam 2 mg, 2% propofol, and remifentanil were injected intravenously. After confirmation of unconsciousness, rocuronium 50 mg was injected for paralysis and a SLT was inserted into the patient's right bronchus. It was intubated deeper than the normal depth because we had to insert the tube into the right bronchus. After we checked via a fiberoptic bronchoscope and auscultated to confirm that the tube had been appropriately inserted, a silastic 7.0 sized single lumen tube (Covidien) was fixed 26 cm at the teeth. Total intravenous anesthesia was adjusted according to the bispectral index (BIS). The patient's position was changed from supine to right lateral decubitus and we reconfirmed through a fiberoptic bronchoscope that the tube was placed correctly. After opening the patient's thorax, the surgeon warned us that the patient's left lung had more adhesion than expected and therefore, a lot of bleeding could be expected. During the operation, there was excessive bleeding from the left lung, because of which we had to transfuse 2750 mL of packed red blood cells, 1200 mL of fresh frozen plasma, and 360 mL of platelets. We also carried out frequent tracheal suctions because there were large amounts of bloody secretions inside the tube. The patient's ABGA showed pH 7.425, pCO2 37.7 mmHg, pO2 169 mmHg, HCO3 24.7 mmol/L with fraction of inspired oxygen 50% and his blood pressure was 109/57 mmHg, the heart rate was 72 beats per minute, and his oxygen saturation was 100%. After tracheal suction was performed, we tried a lung recruitment maneuver and suddenly end-tidal carbon dioxide did not show on the monitor. We tried manual-bagging without success. The patient's oxygen saturation was gradually dropping from 100% to 37%. Tracheal suction was performed and there was a bloody discharge but saturation did not improve. When we decided to use a bronchoscope to see what happened inside the tube, the patient's blood pressure dropped and heart rate was decreasing. We thought that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was needed; therefore, 1 mg of epinephrine was injected via the central line. Surgeons stopped the procedure and started cardiac massage. The patient was in a right lateral decubitus position; hence, we moved him into a supine position and maintained suction through the trachea. During CPR, an approximately 2-cm-sized hematoma (Fig. ) was removed from the endotracheal tube after vigorous suctioning. After removal of the hematoma, the ventilation and patient's vital signs recovered. To reduce risk, we reintubated the patient with a right-sided DLT and used a fiberoptic bronchoscope after intubation. After this event, the surgery was uneventful without any other complications. After surgery completion, the patient was transferred to an intensive care unit. Ten days after surgery, he was transferred to a ward and discharged on postoperative day 65 without any complications. The patient gave his permission to be included in the manuscript. What is the patient's body surface area? Please output your answer in terms of m\u00b2.",

    "question": "An 84-year-old male patient, 165 cm in height and 84 kg in weight, visited the hospital to have TURP for hyperplasia of prostate with obstruction. The patient had no specific medical history. The preoperative chest X-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG) were within normal range. The hemoglobin level (Hb) was 14.2 g/dl, and the hematocrit level was 41.1%, which were within normal limits.\nAfter arriving in the operating room, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), ECG, and pulse oximetry were attached. After a few minutes of rest, blood pressure was 150/95 mmHg, heart rate was 85 beats/min, respiratory rate was 15 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) was 94.0%. The patient's position was maintained at the right lateral decubitus position. After identifying the L4-5 intervertebral space, a 25 G Quincke spinal needle was inserted into the space. After the stylet was removed and cerebrospinal fluid was confirmed to be draining well, 11 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine (Marcaine\u00ae, AstraZeneca AB, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Sweden) with 100 ug of epinephrine was injected. Ten minutes after he was placed in the supine position, the height of sensory block was increased to the T12 and checked by pin-prick test. The patient was placed in a lithotomy position. When bipolar TURP began, the irrigation fluid with 0.9% saline solution was injected from a height of about 150 cm without pressure. The patient had a severely enlarged right lobe of the prostate. At 120 minutes after anesthesia, 4 mg of ondansetron was injected because the patient vomited. At that time vital signs were stable (HR: 71 beats/min, NIBP: 150/85 mmHg). At 135 minutes after anesthesia, the patient complained of pain on operative site, considered to be caused by a low level of anesthesia. Therefore, with the consent of the patient, spinal anesthesia was switched to general anesthesia. Pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen was conducted. After intravenous injection of 250 mg of thiopental and 40 mg of rocuronium, endotracheal intubation with a tube of internal diameter 7.5 mm was performed. Anesthesia was maintained with 2 L/min of oxygen, 2 L/min of air, and 2 vol% of sevoflurane. Tidal volume was 500 ml and respiratory rate was 10 breaths/min, so mechanical ventilation was initiated, when PIP was 24 cmH2O.\nForty minutes after switching to general anesthesia, the surgeon inserted a Foley catheter and finished the surgery. Glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg and neostigmine 1.5 mg were injected for reversal of muscle relaxation, the patient's spontaneous respiration and muscular strength recovered, and the endotracheal tube was removed. His blood pressure was well maintained at 140-100/100-70 mmHg throughout surgery, and the body temperature was around 36.2\u2103. However during emergence 10 mg of labetalol was injected twice due to high blood pressure (180/110 mmHg). The total anesthetic time was 3 hours and 15 minutes, and the total surgical time was 2 hours and 30 minutes. Seven hundred fifty ml of Ringer's lactate were injected, and 5 L of 0.9% saline solution was used as an irrigation fluid. When the patient was transferred to the PACU, SaO2 was measured as 80%. Although 10 L of O2 was provided with nonrebreathing reservoir facial mask, the SaO2 was not maintained at more than 90.0% (HR 77 beats/min, NIBP 190/110 mmHg). Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH 7.159, PaCO2 53.5 mmHg, PaO2 58.9 mmHg, HCO3- 15.9 mmol/L, base excess -9.0 mmol/L, Na+ 139 mmol/L, K+ 3.5 mmol/L, Hb 14.2 g/dl and SaO2 81.8%. The patient complained of severe respiratory difficulties and abdominal pain. On physical examination, abdominal distension was founded. The surgeon suggested conducting an abdominal CT scan, but oxygen saturation was not maintained at more than 90% despite an Ambu-bagging with 10 L of 100% O2. The anesthesiologist decided to perform the endotracheal intubation again. Two hundred fifty mg of thiopental and 50 mg of rocuronium were injected, and endotracheal intubation with a tube of ID 7.5 mm was performed. A chest X-ray was taken and an intravenous injection of 10 mg of furosemide was conducted. In PACU NIBP was 180-140/110-85 mmHg and HR was 80-70 beats/min.\nA chest X-ray was normal. After the abdominal CT scan, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Findings of the abdominal CT scan are seen . In the ICU, pressure support 11 cmH2O, FIO2 0.45, and PEEP 6 cmH2O were maintained as a PSV mode. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH 7.380, PaCO2 26.1 mmHg, PaO2 73.9 mmHg, HCO3- 15.6 mmol/L, base excess -7.3 mmol/L, and SaO2 94.7%. After the test, intravenous injections of 10 mg of furosemide were injected twice. The total volume of urine on the day of the surgery was 1100 cc.\nOn the first day after surgery the endotracheal tube was removed and checked ABGA. Three hours later ultrasonography was conducted and showed that a great volume of fluid had accumulated around the liver. A percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) was done into the right upper abdomen, and about 650 cc of clear yellowish fluid was drawn. The patient was transferred to a general ward on that day. The PCD catheter was removed on the fourth day after the surgery. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the tenth day after the surgery. What is the patient's body surface area?

    "question": "A 17-year-old woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was transferred to our hospital after successful resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation (VF). After the patient was diagnosed with HCM based on the echocardiogram and cardiac biopsy 2 years prior, she had been free from any symptoms or arrhythmic events while taking a beta-blocking drug and ACE inhibitor. Both her father and grandfather had HCM, and her father died suddenly at 53 years old. Although she did not complain of anything, her BNP level was constantly high (500\u2013970 pg/ml), so cibenzoline of 200 mg was added 3 months prior for the purpose of improvement of diastolic function caused by attenuation of the LV contraction and prevention of arrhythmic events. Then, she collapsed while walking due to VF.\nShe arrived at our hospital while undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. Her height was 159 cm and weight 56 kg. Her blood pressure was 158/89 mmHg. Physical examination revealed coarse crackles in her whole chest. Blood tests revealed normal renal function and electrolytes. The plasma cibenzoline concentration was not checked.\nAn ECG showed ectopic atrial rhythm with heart rate of 63 bpm, complete right bundle branch block, and left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T changes with QRS width of 148 ms and QTc of 0.514 (Figure ). Those findings were almost like those before the episode. The serial ECGs showed that QRS width gradually prolonged over 2 years from 110 to 147 ms, suggesting that the conduction disturbance from the His\u2013Purkinje system through the ventricular myocardium had been progressing (Figure ). The ECG findings including QRS width did not change after commencement of the administration of cibenzoline.\nAfter she recovered almost fully without severe neurologic sequelae, a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (S-ICD) was selected for second prevention as she was young and pacing therapy was thought as unnecessary. The surface ECG screening prior to the S-ICD implantation was performed. On the screening, the location of the surface electrodes was the fifth intercostal space along the left mid-axillary line (left leg, LL), 1 cm lateral to the left sternal border and 1 cm above the xiphoid process (left arm, LA), and 14 cm cranial to electrode LA on the left parasternal line (right arm, RA). A ground electrode was placed on the right lower extremity. The alternate vector was from RA to LA electrode, primary vector from LA to LL electrode, and secondary vector from RA to LL electrode. All 3 vectors satisfied the S-ICD screening template in both supine and upright positions; therefore, she was thought to be eligible for S-ICD. Then, she underwent treadmill exercise testing for further screening for the S-ICD with the 3 screening leads of the S-ICD. During exercise, QRS duration increased progressively from 160 ms at rest at a heart rate of 66 bpm to 200 ms at peak exercise at a heart rate of 100 bpm, accompanied by monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at 150 bpm. QRS width during the VT extended further, resulting in polymorphic VT (Figures and ). After she had collapsed, the 3rd DC shock finally succeeded in terminating the VT. This VT was thought to be a proarrhythmia of cibenzoline, and therefore, cibenzoline was changed to sotalol. Re-treadmill exercise testing while receiving sotalol revealed no change in QRS width during exercise, nor did it induce any VT at a similar exercise burden. Her S-ICD was set with the primary vector as the sensing configuration, and she was well without any ICD shocks while taking sotalol.

Her family history was negative.\nPhysical examination revealed centripetal obesity, moon face, buffalo hump, thin skin, hirsutism, acne, striae on her abdomen, arms, and legs, and edema of both lower extremities. The height of this patient was 159 cm, and her body weight was 73.5 kg. Her blood pressure was 130/100 mmHg, with a pulse of 84 beats per minute.\nHer blood counts were within the normal limits, and she had no serum electrolytes disorders. The biochemical data showed dyslipidemia. The oral glucose tolerance test showed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and obviously increased insulin and C-peptide levels. The endocrinological data showed elevated cortisol (761.0 nmol/L) and 24-h urine free cortisol (UFC) (1650.7 nmol/L) and the absence of a circadian rhythm and a non-suppression response to dexamethasone (dexamethasone 0.5 mg every 6 h for 2 d and 2 mg every 6 h for 2 d) administration (Table ).\nAbdominal CT showed bilateral adrenal adenomas with atrophic adrenal glands (right: 3.1 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm \u00d7 1.9 cm; left: 2.2 cm \u00d7 1.9 cm \u00d7 2.1 cm), which were enhanced homogeneously with contrast material (Figure ). A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland demonstrated normal findings.\nThe patient was further evaluated with 1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin (DDVAP). The peripheral DDVAP stimulation test showed a baseline ACTH level of 6.9 pmol/L, and ACTH reached a peak level (7.26 pmol/L) at 90 min after stimulation, which was 1.05 times as high as the baseline level (Table ). Then, we performed bilateral AVS to examine if the two adenomas were cortisol-secreting. Bilateral AVS results were as follows: the left-side adrenal vein (LAV)-to-peripheral vein (PV) cortisol gradient was 16.00; the right-side AV (RAV)-to-PV gradient was 8.29; and the ratio of the LAV cortisol-to-left side aldosterone (ALD) gradient to the RAV cortisol-to-right side ALD gradient was 1.23 (Table ).

She had a history of chronic constipation with about 2 bowel movements per week and hard stools. Five years earlier, she had undergone an appendectomy. She was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 9 months ago and was taking antituberculosis therapy. Her height was 163 cm and her weight was 49 kg. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness and a ping-pong ball-sized movable mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 3.0-cm, round, laminated intraluminal mass with calcification in the cecum (). Colonoscopy revealed fibrotic scar tissue probably due to intestinal tuberculosis in the ascending colon and a web-like stricture in the cecum around a patulous ileocecal valve. In a blind space which was formed by the stricture, a yellowish mass was found (). We could not insert a fiberoptic colonoscope into the cecum, and dilatation was thus performed using a th-rough-the-scope balloon (CRE balloon; Boston Scientific Co., Marlborough, MA, USA) with a diameter of 12 to 15 mm on inflation (). After endoscopic balloon dilatation, the colonoscope was able to pass into the cecum, and a 3.0-cm, yellowish fecaloma was observed. We broke down the fecaloma with a polypectomy snare and grasping forceps. The fecaloma was successfully removed by using a water jet and grasping forceps through the endoscopic procedure (; Supplementary Video 1 online). There was no ulcer in the cecal base. Three mo-nths later, her symptoms improved, and there was no evidence of fecaloma recurrence. Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?",

He was given 15 mg of mosapride, 75 mg of clopidogrel, 20 mg of esomeprazole magnesium, 4 mg of benidipine, 5 mg of linagliptin, 1500 mg of metformin, and 24 \u00b5g of lubiprostone on a regular basis.\nThe patient had no history of smoking or drinking alcohol. He did not undergo regular medical exams. The patient had previously been a carpenter, but was no longer employed. He had no food or drug allergies. He did not need any assistance for everyday life activities. He had a family of six, and presented no family history of malignant disease.\nThe patient was 165 cm tall and weighed 60 kg. His vital signs were normal, with blood pressure of 137/82 mmHg, heart rate of 75 regular beats/min, body temperature of 36.1 \u00b0C, oxygen saturation of 98% in ambient air, and respiratory rate of 16/min; his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 points (E4V5M6). Nothing else abnormal was detected upon physical examination, including skin or neurological findings.\nA routine laboratory examination revealed increased values for white blood cells, proportions of monocyte and basophil, calcium, lactate dehydrogenase, plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, erythropoietin, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A, fibrinogen, d-dimer and decreased values of red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, proportion of neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, platelets, sodium, albumin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, zinc, thyroid stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine. On the other hand, other tests had normal results, including biochemistry, urine qualitative and sediment, and two fecal occult blood tests (Table ).\nA plain head computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 3 cm \u00d7 3.1 cm \u00d7 3 cm sized left MS in the patient, completely filled with mass, with a partially high-density area confirmed inside (Figure ).\nThe patient was referred to an otolaryngologist. At this point, the otolaryngologist suspected a diagnosis of malignant melanoma. On the other hand, she also considered a biopsy under general anesthesia to be very risky due to the patient\u2019s advanced age. Therefore, she made an appointment for a follow-up CT 2 mo later. Following this, left diplopia and ptosis occurred on day 25, and they persisted, so the patient visited our hospital on day 31. A physical examination confirmed left ptosis (Figure ). Additionally, when we opened his eyes passively, hyperexophoria of the left eye was confirmed (Figure ). A follow-up CT performed on the same day revealed the growth of the left MS mass, together with oppression and involvement of the orbital base, and the destruction of the anterior, internal, and external walls. An MS biopsy was performed on day 50, after a 7-d washout period. The hematoxylin and eosin stain pathological findings revealed the following: (1) Aggregates of large, atypical lymphocytes with irregular nuclei with uneven chromatin, and small to large nucleoli evident in a necrotic background; (2) Some cells showed multilobulated nuclei; and (3) Mitosis and apoptotic bodies were conspicuous (Figure ). Immunohistochemical staining revealed positive results for cluster of differentiation (CD) 20-positive cells, bcl-6-positive cells, and MUM1-positive cells (Figures -, respectively). It also revealed negative results for the T cell markers CD3, CD7, and CD45RO. A genetic test was not performed. Here, we excluded the possibility for T cell origin, as well as for the sinus/nasal origin, and established a definitive diagnosis of DLBCL, non-germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) originating from the left MS.\nWe prepared systemic chemotherapy with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), but the patient was admitted on day 62 due to rapid deterioration of his condition. During the physical examination, he could not open his left eye due to the circumocular swelling (Figure ). In addition, multiple skin tumors were confirmed on the chest and abdomen of the patient (Figure and , respectively). A plain CT scan revealed the following: Growth of the left MS mass, together with oppression and involvement of the orbital base, destruction of the anterior, internal, and external walls, and protuberance outside (Figure ); multiple tumors (0.5-1.5 cm in size) in both lungs (Figure ); multiple subcutaneous tumors and chest wall tumors (Figure ); abdominal paraaortic lymph node swelling (3 cm in size) and left kidney nodule (1-2 cm in size) (Figure ). He was referred to a dermatologist on the same day, and a skin biopsy was later performed on day 70. The histopathological images of the biopsy specimen from the skin mass were found to be the same as those of the left MS mass (Figures -). The measured value of the soluble interleukin-2 receptor on day 77 was 8063 U/mL, and BRAFV600E mutation was negative.

    "question": "A 62-year-old, 56.7 kg, 160.4 cm man was scheduled for an emergency OPCAB surgery. The patient has medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus with insulin therapy. He had also been recently diagnosed with unstable angina and three vessel coronary arterial disease with significant left main coronary arterial stenosis. In the preoperative review of the chest computed tomography (CT) angiography, a dilated trachea and main bronchi with numerous tracheal diverticuli () were observed. On the chest CT, the maximum tracheal diameter was 26.31 mm (transverse) and 35.86 mm (sagittal plane), and Mounier-Kuhn syndrome was diagnosed (). The patient was a non-smoker and his preoperative respiratory function tests and arterial blood gas analysis were normal (pH 7.37; PaCO2, 45 mmHg; PaO2, 96 mmHg; HCO3-, 26 mEq/L; SaO2, 97% in air). The preoperative bronchoscopic exam found tracheal expansions with diverticulosis and no endobronchial lesions. After a review of the chest CT, we found an undilated portion of the trachea below vocal cords approximately 2 cm long () and planned to place the balloon of the endotracheal tube in this area. In the operating room, we also prepared endotracheal tubes of various sizes, laryngeal mask airway (LMA), fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with cardiac surgeons before anesthesia.\nThe patient arrived to the operating room with an intra-aortic balloon pump and continuous intravenous nitroglycerin administration (3 \u00b5g/kg/min). Before anesthesia, arterial blood pressure monitoring was started with 1 mg of intravenous midazolam. After sufficient preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, anesthesia was induced with 20 mg etomidate and 100 mg succinylcholine injected intravenously. After successful manual mask ventilation, we intubated the patient with an internal diameter (I.D.) 9 mm cuffed endotracheal tube to place balloon just below the vocal cords (). After fixing the tube 18 cm from the patient's incisor, we checked the trachea using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and confirmed that the lumen of the trachea was relatively preserved. Anesthesia was maintained with a continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil, propofol, and vecuronium, and patient's lung was ventilated with a volume controlled mode with 50% oxygen. A nasogastric Levin tube was inserted for gastric decompression and prevention of pulmonary aspiration. There was intermittent air leakage around the endotracheal tube accompanied with the patient's procedural position changes but it was successfully managed by slightly adjusting the depth of the endotracheal tube. The OPCAB was successfully completed in 6 hours. During the procedure, the patient's airway and ventilation were managed without further manipulations. In the postoperative intensive care unit, the patient was managed by the same strategy as in the operating room, and extubated the next day. After 5 days, he was discharged from the hospital without any respiratory complications. Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?",

    "question": "A 68-year-old man presented to our institution. He previously underwent laparoscopic intersphincteric resection of the rectum with diverting loop ileostomy for lower rectal cancer at the age of 56. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful. A pathological examination revealed that the patient had T1, N1a, M0, Stage IIIA rectal adenocarcinoma. He did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, and there was no recurrence of cancer during the follow-up period. However, soon after surgery, he developed an anastomotic stenosis requiring repeated endoscopic balloon dilatation.\nHis loop stoma was not reversed because these treatments were unsuccessful. Therefore, the surgeon proposed surgical resection of the anastomosis, but the patient did not agree to undergo permanent colostomy. Consequently, he had lived with loop ileostomy since undergoing surgery.\nTwelve years postoperatively, he felt swelling and pain in the scrotum. He was seen by a local physician and diagnosed with a perineal abscess. He was referred to a urologist at our hospital for treatment. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a low-density area and air-fluid level in the perianal region (Fig. ), which was consistent with the signs of a perianal abscess. Drainage was performed, and the abscess was resolved. The urologist was concerned about the cause of the perineal abscess, and anastomotic complications were considered to be associated with the abscess. The patient was then referred to the department of surgery for further evaluation and treatment.\nDuring examinations, we found that the patient did not have a significant medical history, including inflammatory bowel disease. He denied having any allergies. He had undergone surgery for an inguinal hernia and duodenal ulcer. He quit smoking after undergoing rectal cancer surgery. He took oral antibiotics after the perineal abscess was drained; otherwise, he denied taking any routine medications.\nHe was 161 cm in height and 50 kg in weight, and his body mass index was 19 kg/m2. A physical examination revealed a well-healed scar on his abdomen and a loop stoma in the right lower quadrant. A digital examination revealed severe stenosis at 2 cm from the anal verge. The patient was afebrile and did not have pain in the scrotum or anus. Given his stable medical condition, we judged that urgent surgical intervention was unnecessary. Close observation with a radiological evaluation was planned.\nOne month later, the patient developed skin ulcers in the right ankle (Fig. ) and around the stoma (Fig. ), with a fever over 39 \u00b0C. He also presented with bloody discharge per anus. Laboratory data showed there was an elevated C-reactive protein level (11.1 mg/dL) and white blood cell count (7710/mL), while the hemoglobin and albumin levels were decreased (9.4 and 2.6 g/dL, respectively). Regarding the skin ulcers, the culture studies were negative for bacteria, whereas a pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed pyoderma gangrenosum. These findings suggested that the patient\u2019s acute illness may have reflected an inflammatory response rather than infectious disease.\nColonoscopy revealed that the bowel lumen had narrowed at 2 cm from the anal verge and extended to 10 cm from the anal verge, where a fistula was incidentally found (Fig. ). Moreover, edematous and easily hemorrhagic mucosa was observed throughout the proximal colon (presumably the transverse colon). The endoscopic examination was terminated soon after we detected a mucosal laceration in the transverse colon that was possibly caused by air insufflation (Fig. ). A pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the colon revealed inflammatory mucosa with infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. These findings were interpreted as nonspecific colitis and did not indicate a definitive diagnosis of a condition such as UC, DC, or infectious colitis. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT did not show signs of cancer recurrence or bowel ischemia.\nA contrast enema confirmed that the distal bowel was narrowed with a fistula, whereas the remnant colon appeared to be consistent with the \u201clead pipe\u201d phenomenon (Fig. ). We observed active and diffuse mucosal inflammation that indicated UC; pyoderma gangrenosum of the skin is well-known to be an extra-intestinal feature of UC. Given the findings of the physical, laboratory, and imaging studies, we hypothesized that the pathogenesis of the disease was either UC in the diverted colon or DC mimicking UC.\nAfter reviewing the patient\u2019s clinical episodes and extensively discussing the case with gastroenterologists, surgeons, stoma nurses, and the patient, we proposed total colectomy with end ileostomy. Then, the patient finally agreed to undergo this procedure.\nWith the patient under general anesthesia in the lithotomy position, we performed total colectomy with open laparotomy and transperineal resection of the rectum, in accordance with the abdominoperineal resection. The loop ileostomy was taken down and the end ileostomy was reconstructed at the same stoma site. The operative time was 267 min and the estimated blood loss was 210 mL.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged home on the 11th postoperative day.\nA macroscopic view of the resected specimen is shown in Fig. . The coloanal anastomosis had significant stenosis. There was a fistula proximal to the anastomosis. There was atrophic mucosa, and haustra had disappeared from the distal colon. In contrast, the mucosa appeared to be reddened, edematous, and rather dilated in the proximal colon. The pathological findings included erosion and ulceration in the edematous wall, a crypt abscess, and inflammatory infiltration into the mucosa throughout the colon (Fig. \u2013), without any evidence of dysplasia or carcinoma. The pathological diagnosis was consistent with UC. Given that he developed these inflammatory mucosal alterations after the surgery requiring fecal diversion, we concluded that DC mimicking UC was appropriate for the final diagnosis.\nThe skin ulcers in the right ankle and around the stoma healed over time. Six months after the last surgery, the ulcer areas were significantly reduced (Fig. \u2013). Three years after the last surgery, the skin ulcers were completely healed with some scar tissue (Fig. \u2013).\nWe reported the rare case of a man with acute and severe DC mimicking UC with extra-intestinal manifestations, and he was successfully managed with surgical treatment. His clinical symptoms and histological findings were consistent with the findings of UC, suggesting there is a possible pathogenetic link between DC and UC.\nDC is a frequently seen consequence of the interrupted fecal stream and is characterized by nonspecific mucosal inflammation. In patients who undergo fecal diversion surgery, 70\u201391% have the endoscopic diagnosis of DC, and 70\u2013100% of those have some histological changes [, , , ]. Typically, the altered bacterial flora decreases luminal SCFA in the diverted intestine, and this may play a role in the development of DC [, ]. Despite the high incidence of DC, most patients are asymptomatic [, ]. Surgical re-anastomosis is the most favorable treatment, whereas some medications are also available [\u2013]. However, acute and severe colitis may occur [, ], and a careful assessment with a prompt decision about the treatment is required in clinical settings.\nIn our case, the decision-making process was as follows. Initially, we considered nonsurgical, conservative treatment targeting UC. However, an enema or oral agents could not reach the diseased colon directly, and steroids or immunomodulators may have provoked a secondary infection and/or recurrent perineal abscess. The presence of a fistula also prohibited the use of these agents. There does not appear to be sufficient evidence supporting cytapheresis for the treatment of DC.\nSecond, the friability of the colonic mucosa represented by insufflation-induced lacerations required urgent and effective treatment. Although the patient underwent diversion, he was nearly at risk of experiencing colonic perforation. Moreover, imaging studies had already shown the presence of a mucosal fistula.\nThird, pyoderma gangrenosum of the skin had worsened rapidly. These features were the patient\u2019s chief complaints, and delayed or prolonged treatment would have diminished his quality of life. Finally, we considered reversing the fecal stream with loop ileostomy closure. However, we deemed it impossible because of the anastomotic stenosis and colonic fistula. Thereafter, we decided to perform surgical resection of the residual colon, including the coloanal anastomosis.\nTo diagnose DC, it is necessary to exclude other bowel disorders such as IBD, radiation colitis, infectious colitis, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated colitis. A histological examination is paramount for the diagnosis; however, a comprehensive assessment of the patient\u2019s disease, social, and medical histories is also required to determine the treatment strategy.\nDC is regarded as a multifactorial disease []; the causative factors include alterations in intestinal bacterial flora [, , , ], overproduction of oxygen free radicals, impairment of butyrate oxidation [, ], defects in the transport of SCFA, and immunological factors []. Regarding immunological factors, some intestinal mucosal changes or disruption may produce inflammatory or immunoregulatory cytokines, and they induce predominant T helper cell type 1 (Th1). A previous report demonstrated that the Th1 phenotype might be the pathogenesis of DC []. Others indicated that tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6, and transforming growth factor beta are important in the treatment of DC [\u2013].\nThe endoscopic features of DC include erythema, friability, and edema, and in severe cases, ulcers, filiform and inflammatory polyps, and strictures are found [\u2013]. The most common pathological features include expanded lymphoid aggregates and inflammation in the lamina propria with lymphocytes and plasma cells [, ].\nIn some cases, follicular lymphoid hyperplasia with crypt distortion and basal lymphoplasmacytosis were observed in DC [, , ]. In such cases, the crypts may appear atrophic and short and are displaced by lymphoid infiltrates. Lymphoid hyperplasia, in which the germinal centers of B and T cell lymphocytes are enlarged, is found in pediatric patients but not in all adult patients with DC [, , , , ]. The microscopic abnormalities found in those with DC may also occur in those with UC, and these diseases cannot be distinguished from one another []. One study hypothesized that the histological resemblance of DC to active UC suggests there is a pathogenetic link between the two diseases [].\nImmunological factors could play important roles in the pathogenesis of both DC and UC. In our case, the differential diagnoses of DC and UC remain unclear. The acute illness of this patient was represented by a perineal abscess, high-grade fever, bloody discharge per anus, and skin ulcers, which could be interpreted as UC with extra-intestinal manifestations. The colonic fistula may indicate chronic inflammation in the diverted colon. These findings suggest that DC may mimic UC, and acute progression of the disease can eventuate in a long-term period in patients without a pre-existing IBD.\nThis report has some limitations. There is still controversy about how to distinguish DC and UC, and there are concerns about total colectomy in patients with acute and severe diseases. Larger case series are required to compare symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with DC and should include periodic histological examinations of the diverted colon. This will help to elucidate the pathogenesis of DC. Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?",

    "question": "A 64-year-old man, 165 cm in height and 70 kg in weight, visited the department of neurosurgery due to severe pain on the left lateral leg. On physical examination, left ankle dorsiflextion was impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lumbosacral vertebral column showed a left paramedian disc extrusion, between lumbar 4 and 5 vertebras. The patient was scheduled for discectomy. In premedical history, the patient complained of dysarthria, dysphagia and weakness in both legs, while walking 3 years ago. He also complained of dyspnea, although, there were no abnormalities on the blood gas analysis. On the physical findings by a neurologist, deep tendon reflex was exacerbated and babinski test was positive. The electromyogram (EMG) suggested that the patient had a motor neuron disease and he was diagnosed with ALS. Pulmoary function test was not performed before the operation, due to the undergoing emergency operation for resolution of severe pain on the left leg.\nSpinal anesthesia for discectomy was chosen to avoid respiratory complication, which is associated with general anesthesia. No preanesthetic medication was given. Spinal anesthesia was done between lumbar 3 and 4, via a midline approach in the left lateral position and was injected with 10 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine, plus fentanyl 20 \u00b5g using a 25 guage Quinke spinal needle. Immediately after the injection of local anesthetic agent and opioid, the patient was placed back to the supine position. The level of the spinal anesthesia was T10, after 15 minutes and then we changed the patient's position from supine to prone position. Propofol at a rate of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg/hr was infused for sedation with O2 5 L/min via nasal cannula. Intraoperatively, vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 122 to 139/81 to 95 mmHg; heart rate between 75 and 97 beats/min; and oxygen saturation of 100%. There were no complications for one and a half hour of the surgery. The patient was monitored for one hour, in postoperative anesthetic care units (PACU), and then was discharged from PACU. The patient was fully recovered at 5 hours, after the spinal anesthesia and no exacerbation of neurologic signs or symptoms were revealed. The patient was discharged two days after surgery and at the 3 months follow-up, there were no neurologic complications due to spinal anesthesia.

The patient left school when he was in the third grade of primary school because of learning issues. He was unable to read and write properly, and had deficits in intellectual ability like reasoning or problem solving. Currently, the patient was working as a cleaner in a factory. He was noted to have mild ID.\nOn physical examination, the patient had no dysmorphic features. He was married for 8 years; he and his wife were not consanguineous. His parents had two children and the family history of the patient was remarkable for a deceased brother at the age of 15 years, who had also ID (\n). Since there was no history of spontaneous pregnancy during his marriage, the patient was considered to represent a case of primary infertility who had also mild ID.

    "question": "In the summer of 2007, a 25-year-old Japanese woman (height 161 cm, body weight 80 kg, body mass index 30.8 kg/m2) felt weakness in both upper limbs and could not raise both arms while washing her face. Suspected neuromuscular symptoms included eyelid ptosis, trismus when gargling, and inability to stand due to weakness in lower extremities. She was immediately hospitalized in the internal medicine department at Kyoto University for further evaluation. No particular family and personal medical history were reported. Bilateral eyelid ptosis, masticatory muscle fatigue, and diffuse weakness of all limbs, denoting Osserman IIA classification, were noted on physical examination. A Tensilon test was positive, and the serum acetylcholine receptor antibody (anti-AChR) level was markedly elevated (32 nmol/L), which was strongly indicative of MG. Electromyography showed a waning phenomenon. In addition, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a thymoma. After evaluating these clinical findings, she was diagnosed as having MG. According to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) scale, her muscular weakness was categorized as class IIIa. At the time of initial diagnosis, in July 2007, she did not prefer surgical resection of the thymoma, and received orally administered anti-cholinesterase inhibitor (pyridostigmine 60 mg/day). However, her symptoms did not improve. She was therefore given a corticosteroid (oral methylprednisolone up to 30 mg/day) in addition to the anti-cholinesterase inhibitor. Although symptoms of MG were initially relieved, at the beginning of the year 2010, clinical recurrence of MG was observed. The serum anti-AChR level was markedly elevated at 46 nmol/L. She was readmitted to our hospital with weakness of the extremities and worsened ptosis. She received systemic steroid pulse therapy, and the first course comprised 1000 mg of methylprednisolone administered intravenously for 3 days. Finally, in April 2010, she underwent thymectomy performed via a trans-sternal approach using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. During the perioperative period, she received intravenous corticosteroid pulse therapy three times, amounting to a total of 12,000 mg methylprednisolone equivalent. Myasthenic weakness improved MGFA IIa; administration of corticosteroid was gradually tapered to 20 mg/day as a maintenance dose. Her serum anti-AChR level was decreased to 11 nmol/L.\nAt the end of the year 2014, when she was 32-years old, sudden right hip arthritis occurred. She was referred to our orthopedic department during the next 2 months. We suspected a case of steroid-induced ONFH because she received repeated systemic corticosteroid pulse therapy for MG. There were abnormal signs in magnetic resonance imaging of her bilateral hip joints. Thus, she was diagnosed as having bilateral stage 3A, type C (type C1 in right hip, type C2 in left hip) ONFH (Fig. ) classified based on the 2001 revised Japanese Investigation Committee guidelines []. After bilateral ONFH diagnosis, she complained of continuous and hip joint pain on both sides, stronger on the left than on the right. Therefore, she was scheduled for a left primary THA initially. In October 2015, an elective left THA was performed via an anterolateral approach with our patient in a lateral position using the cementless THA system (R3 acetabular cup, SL-PLUS stem, and 28 mm Oxinium head on highly cross-linked polyethylene; Smith & Nephew). The cementless cup was first placed targeting 20\u00b0 anteversion using the manufacturer\u2019s cup inserter and 40\u00b0 abduction by aligning the jig to the longitudinal axis of the body. Using the CA technique, stem anteversion was coordinated with cup anteversion targeting a CA angle of 50 \u00b1 10\u00b0. During surgery, we confirmed that there was no tendency of dislocation by simulating dislocation of the hip under general anesthesia (maximum flexion with maximum internal rotation for simulating posterior dislocation, and maximum external rotation with maximum extension for simulating anterior dislocation). We confirmed proper alignment of the prosthesis by evaluating postoperative radiographs. In the analysis of postoperative X-ray and CT scans after left THA, the cup inclination angle, the cup anteversion angle, and the stem anteversion angle were 37\u00b0, 13\u00b0, and 35\u00b0, respectively. The resulting CA angle was 48\u00b0 (Fig. ). Her postoperative course was normal, and following rehabilitation therapy including conventional training of daily living, standing up from the floor, sitting straight, and sitting cross legged, she became ambulatory and was discharged.\nThree months after surgery, due to sudden occurrence of myasthenic weakness in her lower extremities while resting on a bed, she tended to raise her left limb up using both hands for sitting up. With her left leg in a figure-of-four position, she experienced sudden-onset severe pain and locking of left hip movement. She was diagnosed as having anterior dislocation following THA (Fig. ) and treated with closed reduction under sedation at the emergency department of another hospital. One year postoperatively, her University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score for her left hip improved to 4 from a preoperative activity score of 3 and her Harris Hip Score (HHS) improved to 81.0 points in her left hip compared with a preoperative HHS of 49.0 points. She was followed up as an out-patient but right hip pain developed gradually. At the end of the year 2016, an elective right THA was performed as was done earlier on her left side. Postoperative radiographic assessment using CT images after right THA showed that the cup inclination angle, the cup anteversion angle, the stem anteversion angle, and the CA was 42\u00b0, 27\u00b0, 24\u00b0, and 51\u00b0 respectively (Fig. ). No postoperative complications were observed. We instructed her to exercise care during passive movements of her left leg, which may worsen her MG condition. No recurrence of dislocation in either hip has been observed since. Clinical scores in her right hip improved (UCLA activity score, 5; and HHS, 81.0 points) compared with those preoperatively (UCLA activity score, 4; HHS, 65.0 points) at the final follow-up. She returned to a normal life and has been able to walk long distances without a cane. We are carefully following her up as an out-patient.

    "question": "In February 2011, a retroperitoneal tumor was suspected by a health check in a 57-year-old Japanese woman and subsequent examination led to the suspicion of a right pheochromocytoma. As the patient was a Jehovah's Witness, she wished to undergo bloodless surgery and consulted our hospital in June 2011 after being refused surgery by several hospitals.\nThe characteristics of the patient recorded at the time of hospital admission were as follows: height: 154 cm, weight: 56 kg, blood pressure: 115/65 mm Hg and heart rate: 78 bpm and regular. The tumor was palpable in the right hypochondrium. There were no physical signs of Cushing's syndrome such as moon facies or buffalo hump. There were no abnormal findings in the peripheral blood and biochemical tests. Endocrine tests revealed high levels of urinary normetanephrine (1.60 mg/day). There were no abnormal findings in any other items, including blood adrenaline, cardiac function, and pulmonary function.\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a retroperitoneal tumor (size: 12 cm) touching the upper pole of the right kidney with an uneven contrast-enhanced effect inside the tumor. The tumor had ill-defined borders with the surrounding liver, right kidney, inferior vena cava, right renal artery and vein, and left renal vein, which indicated adhesion (fig. ). There was no clear lymph node metastasis or distal metastasis on imaging. The tumor had a low signal intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. Marked accumulation was found on 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy.\nThe above findings were suggestive of a right adrenal pheochromocytoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT findings revealed that tumorectomy required a right renal combined resection, sectioning of the right renal artery and vein, left renal vein, and inferior vena cava, and detachment of the tumor from the lower hepatic surface. Despite explaining the importance of blood to the patient once again as an outpatient, she did not give consent. However, we were able to gain her consent for the use of albumin preparations, intraoperative diluted autotransfusions, intraoperative recovery-type autotransfusions, the use of a heart-lung machine, and hemodialysis. A preoperation conference was held with the four hospital departments including anesthesiology, gastrointestinal surgery (because of the detachment of the tumor from the liver), and cardiovascular surgery (extracorporeal circulation is required when sectioning the inferior vena cava). The type of surgical procedure was confirmed, and the risks involved were sufficiently discussed. Then, the patient and her friends were provided the details of the surgery. The patient also acknowledged the risk of bleeding to death because of bloodless surgery, loss of renal function because of the removal of the right kidney and left renal vein, the possibility of hemodialysis, the risk of partial liver removal, and eventual exploratory laparotomy. After the patient understood all risks and consented, a written consent and waiver of liability for blood transfusion refusal were signed. In accordance with the surgical policy, an erythropoietin preparation, iron, and doxazosin mesylate were administered prior to surgery.\nAfter the diagnosis of right pheochromocytoma, open surgery was conducted with an abdominal midline incision in August 2011. During operation, the tumor was found adhered to the peritoneum, diaphragm, lower hepatic surface, inferior vena cava, and right renal vein. It engulfed the right renal artery and vein.\nFirst, the adhesion site of the tumor was detached from the lower hepatic surface. Partial hepatic resection was not necessary. Then, the anterior surface of the tumor was detached from the left renal vein, and the left renal vein was secured. Next, the right renal artery was tied, and blood flow to the right kidney was blocked. A clamp test was performed on the inferior vena cava and left renal vein, and as there were no changes in blood pressure, the bypass was considered adequate. Next, the tumor was very carefully detached from the inferior vena cava, which was tied to protect the right renal vein as tumor detachment progressed. Lastly, the tumor vessels flowing into the inferior vena cava were tied, and both the right kidney and tumor were removed. The inferior vena cava and left renal vein were preserved. The operative times were 8 h and 18 min and blood loss was 1,770 ml.\nThe resected specimen (size: 10.5 \u00d7 11.9 cm) was macroscopically brown in appearance with multiple cysts. There was no continuity of the tumor in the normal adrenal gland, and it was diagnosed as paraganglioma (fig. ).\nOn histological findings, the tumor consisted of a hyperplasia of cells with basophilic cytoplasm and was arranged in an alveolar pattern around fibrous blood vessels (fig. ). Histologically, there was no clear continuity of the tumor in the adrenal gland tissue, and an extra-adrenal paraganglioma was diagnosed. No invasion into the right adrenal gland or right kidney was observed.\nFollowing surgery, the patient progressed without any major changes in blood pressure or other complications and the high urinary normetanephrine level returned to normal. After discharge, the patient continues to have follow-ups at her home hospital. Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?",

    "question": "A 50-year-old woman (height 155 cm, weight 60 kg) first presented to our hospital with left hip pain, limited range of motion, and limping. Trendelenburg gait was observed. She did not have a history of treatment for DDH. She developed hip joint pain and underwent right DTT at the age of 20 years. Her hip pain had improved after the surgery; however, she started to feel pain again at 2 years after DDT. She underwent right-sided THA at another hospital at the age of 47 years.\nRadiographs showed severe osteoarthritis of her left hip joint and the left greater trochanter, which had moved to the level of the lesser trochanter. The past THA on the right hip joint was visible as well (). The LLD was 55 mm.\nThe right THA was performed at the age of 47, and the left THA was performed at the age of 50. The THA procedures comprised conventional cementless THA in the same way as in Case 1 (anesthesia, surgical approach, implants, and rehabilitation).\nIntraoperatively, the surgeon had to pay close attention to identify the gluteus medius and minimus muscles and prevent damage to the same muscle due to hypertension during the reduction after implant placement, similar to the circumstances of case 1. The operation time was 60 min, and the total blood loss was 488 g (intra and postoperative blood loss). The leg lengthening was 27 mm, and 28 mm of the LLD persisted.\nAs in Case 1, the pain improved remarkably; however, the patient presented with LLD due to an abduction contraction following extension of the leg length. The abduction contraction improved within two months under physical therapy. No other complications, such as dislocation, neurovascular abnormality, or infection, were observed. Final radiographs at 11 years after left THA did not show subsidence of the stem or any type of loosening around the cup or stem (). The preoperative JOA hip score was 39 points, which improved to 71 points at 11 years after surgery. Trendelenburg gait had improved.

    "question": "A 48-year-old male patient (186 cm, 88 kg) was referred to our orthopedic outpatient clinic with a history of atraumatic persisting left shoulder pain lasting for several months. Physiotherapy, oral analgesics, and subacromial infiltrations showed no lasting effect. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an RCT of M. supraspinatus (Patte Grade I; Goutallier/Fuchs Type I) and M. subscapularis (Lafosse Type I) [, , ].\nThe patient underwent ARCR using a suture bridge-like construct (SpeedBridge\u2122 [SB], Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA) for rotator cuff repair as well as an LHB tenodesis through one BioComposite SwiveLock\u2122 (Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA). The cranial part of the partially torn subscapularis tendon was attached to the LHB anchor.\nAt 6-week follow-up, the patient showed an adequate range of passive motion and no signs of shoulder stiffness. Nine weeks postoperatively, the patient suffered a low-velocity trauma to his left shoulder. He presented to the emergency room with immobilizing pain rated 9/10 on the numeric analog scale. Radiographic examination (, ) and a computer tomography scan (CT, , ) revealed an isolated fracture of the proximal humeral head (AO/OTA fracture and dislocation classification 11C1.3) []. The fracture line was located right at the lateral site of the suture bridge construct close to the anatomic neck (Neer Type II, []). Due to a displacement of 1 cm, surgical refixation was advised.\nUnder general anesthesia, the fracture site was exposed using a delta split approach. Total reruptures of previously reconstructed rotator cuff tendons were detected, and anchor material was removed. The fracture was reduced, and definitive fixation was performed with a PHILOS\u2122-Plate system (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, Indiana, USA). Rotator cuff tendons were reconstructed and additionally attached to the plate through Ethibond\u00ae fibers (Ethicon, Somerville, Massachusetts) in Mason-Allen technique.\nPost-operative radiographs showed good reduction of the fracture so that post-operative rehabilitation following a standardized protocol was initiated ().\nAt 3-month follow-up, the fracture healed anatomically with the patient\u2019s passive range of motion already within normal limits. Constant score was 68 and improved to 92 points at 1-year and 2-year follow-up. Radiographic examination at 1-year follow-up revealed adequate fracture consolidation (, ).

    "question": "A 35-year-old, 157 cm, 52 kg, woman was hospitalized for surgical treatment of peroneal tendonitis in her right foot. She had no significant medical history, allergy, or previous neurological disease. She underwent surgery for the same condition 1 year earlier at another hospital. Spinal anesthesia was performed and the operation was uneventful. After transferring to the general ward, the patient's right leg began moving involuntarily. The movement was rhythmic and was limited to the right leg. The transient movement disappeared completely after 30 min, and no complication resulted. A specific diagnosis for the movement was not determined. The patient experienced no further problem.\nOn a preoperative visit to our hospital, she expressed no fear regarding spinal anesthesia and agreed to undergo spinal anesthesia again.\nPremedication consisted of 2.5 mg of midazolam, administered intramuscularly 30 min before surgery. In the operating room, standard monitoring (non-invasive blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram) was used. The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position, and lumbar puncture was performed without difficulty at L3-4. After free-flowing cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, 9 mg of heavy bupivacaine 0.5% (Marcaine Spinal 0.5% Heavy\u00ae, AstraZeneca, Sweden) and 0.2 mg of epinephrine were administered via a 25 G spinal needle. The procedure was performed without complication. Sensory input to T10 was blocked, and the surgery was completed uneventfully in approximately 50 min.\nAfter surgery, the patient was transferred to a recovery room. Approximately 100 min after administration of anesthesia, she began to experience bilateral, involuntary myoclonic movement of both legs and arms. Sensory function in her arms was intact, and the rhythm of the movement varied widely in rate. She was conscious, oriented, and calm. At that point, 2 mg of midazolam was administered intravenously. Approximately 10 min later, she was treated with 0.5 mg of oral clonazepam and 2 mg of IV midazolam. The myoclonic movement diminished slightly, but persisted. A neurology consult was obtained. There was no evidence of weakness or impairment of cerebellar or cranial nerve dysfunction. Thus, these movements were clinically defined as spinal myoclonus. After approximately 1 h, 0.5 mg of clonazepam was administered again. The myoclonic movement disappeared completely at 4 h after its onset. Postoperative laboratory findings, including serum electrolytes and glucose, were within normal limits. When she was examined again the following day, no abnormal neurologic finding was evident. One month later, she visited the hospital again; no recurrence of spinal myoclonus had occurred. Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?",

    "question": "A 15-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the general pediatric service at our institution with a three-week history of progressive myalgias and profound proximal muscle weakness of the bilateral lower extremities. She noted dark urine two weeks prior to presentation and reported weight gain, fatigue, and leg swelling of six months' duration. She denied taking any medications. Her family history was remarkable for adult onset hypothyroidism in her mother.\nOn physical examination, the patient weighed 100 kg (+2.41 SD) and was 170 cm in height (+1.24 SD) with stable vital signs. She had bilateral, knee-level, nonpitting edema without periorbital edema or goiter. Her neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves, bilateral symmetric proximal muscle weakness (3/5) in the quadriceps, hamstrings, hip flexors, and extensors, and intact sensation to light touch, temperature, and proprioception. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in all four extremities. Both thighs were tender to palpation. She had Tanner 4 breasts and pubic hair development. The remainder of her physical and neurological examination was within normal limits.\nLaboratory results included normal hemoglobin, electrolytes, and renal function. Her creatine kinase (CK) was elevated at 34724 IU/L (26\u2013140) and was accompanied by elevation of transaminases and myoglobinuria. Thyroid studies revealed the following: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 77.2 mIU/mL (0.35\u20135.5), free thyroxine (fT4) 0.17 ng/dL (0.58\u20131.64), and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody 162 IU/mL (<35) (). Electromyography/nerve conduction Studies showed short duration, low amplitude motor units with an early recruitment pattern, 2+ fibrillations, and 2+ positive sharp waves in all muscle samples, consistent with a myopathic process. The patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis in the setting of severe hypothyroidism unmasked by moderate exertion. She was treated with aggressive intravenous fluid replacement (4 liters/day of 0.45% saline) and strict bed rest. Levothyroxine replacement of 75 mcg/day was started on day two of hospitalization, and on day seven, the dose was increased to 100 mcg/day.\nDespite rapid clinical improvement, our patient continued to have elevated CK values () warranting further investigation for other etiologies of rhabdomyolysis, including testing for infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), both of which were negative. She did not report using (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors, which have been associated with rhabdomyolysis []. On the second week of hospitalization, a muscle biopsy was performed to rule out metabolic etiologies predisposing to rhabdomyolysis. The biopsy revealed severe myonecrosis and inflammation (). It ruled out congenital metabolic myopathies such as myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle's disease), carnitine deficiency syndromes, or defective beta-oxidation enzymes. The slow decline in CK values as well as persistent weakness was consistent with severe muscle injury facilitated by profound hypothyroidism and moderate exercise ().\nOur patient continued to improve clinically, her CK levels decreased to 22737 IU/L (), and on day fourteen, she was discharged on levothyroxine at a daily dose of 150 mcg. At her follow-up visit two weeks after discharge, the patient remained clinically well with improved fatigue. She experienced a 4.8 kg weight loss but retained mild weakness in her hip flexors and extensors (4/5 strength). Approximately two months after presentation, her thyroid function tests had normalized and her CK level had declined to <6,000 IU/L ().

    "question": "A 47-year-old female (body mass index, 30.5 kg/m2 (160 cm, 78 kg)) presented in a corresponding hospital with acute pain in the upper abdomen after gastric bypass and cholecystectomy 9 years earlier and loosing 40 kg weight afterward. At the first consultation in the emergency department, she complained of massive abdominal pain since the night before admission, which did not respond to analgesic drugs. Because of the patient\u2019s history of bariatric surgery and the suspicion of SBO, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which was inconclusive at the first look with multiple differential diagnoses. It showed a thickening of the wall of the ascending colon and a diverticulum of the duodenum with semisolid contents. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further treatment.\nIn our emergency department, the patient\u2019s general condition was reduced because of pain and signs of diffuse peritonitis. The vital signs showed a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg and an accelerated pulse (120 bpm), a respiratory rate of 25/min and a normal body temperature. The blood results showed a leukocytosis with only slightly elevated C-reactive protein (14 mg/l). The CT scan was reviewed and revealed the presence of retroperitoneal and parapancreatic fluid with some air bubbles, which could also be seen in an additional abdominal sonography. Further a thickening of the colon ascendens was found (). A perforated duodenal diverticulum was likely and suspected. The thickening of the ascending colon was interpreted as an accompanying colitis.\nAttributable to the reduced condition of the patient with little response to opioids, signs of diffuse peritonitis and our interpretation of the imaging, we decided to perform an explorative transverse laparotomy in the upper abdomen. Although the right colic flexure was mobilized, the exposure of the duodenum was difficult and very limited. However, a hard resistance could be palpated. After a Kocher maneuver and exposing the duodenum and the pancreas dorsally, we were then able to dissect the duodenal diverticulum. The diverticular wall was incised and a biliary stone of the size of ~7 \u00d7 4cm was exposed and removed (). Sutures then reattached the duodenal wall. A T-drain was placed intraduodenally, an Easy-Flow drain paraduodenally ( and ). Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU for initial surveillance. An empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam was initiated. After one night, the patient could be transferred to the normal ward in stable condition.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. Pain was controlled with basis analgesia and slowly she returned to a normal diet. Inflammatory markers were declining and antibiotics could soon be stopped. Ten days postoperatively, a fistulography showed a persistent retroperitoneal collection of 3 \u00d7 3 cm so the drains were left in situ. Two days later, the patient was discharged from the hospital in proper general condition but with extraduodenal drains still in place.\nOne week after dismissal, the patient felt well with normal appetite and a regular intestinal passage. The fistulography showed a significant reduction of the collection so the T-drain was removed. Two weeks later, she still felt irritated by the last remaining Easy-Flow drainage, which continued showing some turbid liquid and was therefore left in situ. Intestinal passage was unchanged and there were no signs of inflammation. Another 2 weeks later, the drain fell out by accident. Seven weeks postoperatively, still no signs of inflammation, we were able to finish our treatment. Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?",

Her past medical history included hypertension controlled with 20 mg enalapril once a day. Preoperative airway examination revealed a class II Mallampati with a normal mouth opening and normal dentition, a thyromental distance of 6.0 cm and limited neck extension. Paraplegia was present and no other abnormalities were detected on physical examination. All laboratory values, chest x-ray and 12-lead electrocardiogram were normal. The patient was premedicated with 10 mg diazepam on the night before surgery along with overnight fasting. After adequate preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced with 50 \u03bcg fentanyl, TIVA of propofol and remifentanil, and muscle relaxation was achieved with 50 mg rocuronium. Conventional direct laryngoscopy was performed and Cormack and Lehane grade was II (only the posterior extremity of the glottis visible). A 37F left-sided polyvinylchloride Carlens DLT (SUMI\u00ae, Portex Inc., Mexico) was placed using standard technique, although difficult to achieve because of a narrowed trachea. The patient's lung was ventilated through both lumens of the tube, with tracheal cuff inflated, but a resistance at manual ventilation was felt immediately after intubation. Chest auscultation revealed bilaterally equal and diminished breath sounds with pulse oximetry saturation decreasing from 99% to 96%. DLT was removed and before a second left endobronchial intubation attempt, examination of the DLT showed no carinal hook (Figure ). An 8.0 mm ID single-lumen endotracheal tube was placed and then fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed. An increased in pulse oximetry saturation (from 95% to 99%) with normal chest auscultation was noted. The fiberoptic examination showed the carinal hook located in the right mainstem bronchus, which was removed with the use of forceps. No evidence of a traumatized airway was noted. Two further attempts were made with another 37F Carlens DLT, by a different physician and with the aid of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (external diameter: 4.5 mm). However, DLT rotation failed because of a narrowed trachea. Smaller DLTs were not available. Thoracotomy was performed in left position with an 8.0 mm ID single-lumen endotracheal tube.

He complained of asthenia, oedema of the lower limbs and face, polydipsia (2\u20133 l/day), polyuria and cutaneous trunk and face hyperpigmentation of approximately 1 month\u2019s evolution. He had a non-productive cough, reported no recent weight changes and had hypertension being treated with lisinopril and furosemide. The patient\u2019s personal tobacco history encompassed a 36 pack-year consumption; he also had a slight alcohol habit (23 g alcohol/day), dyslipidaemia and hyperuricaemia, treated on an outpatient basis with a statin and colchicine. The patient had temporarily lived in Brazil, Angola and Guinea for over 10 years due to his activities as an air force military officer.\nObjective examination revealed mild melanoderma and apyrexia. The patient was conscious and temporally and spatially oriented. He weighed 96.6 kg, with a height of 192 cm and a body mass index of 26.2 kg/m2. Cardiac auscultation revealed no changes while pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral wheezing and snoring.

    "question": "A 43-year-old woman with unremarkable past medical history and no use of tobacco or alcohol presented with upper abdominal discomfort with extremity weakness. Upon admission to a local hospital, gastroscopy revealed a gastric mass of 3 cm in diameter. The Billroth I procedure was then performed 2 weeks later and the pathological diagnosis of the resected specimen was reported as a spindle cell tumor in the local hospital. Postoperatively, no adjuvant therapy was performed and the resected specimens were referred to our hospital for immunohistochemical examination. Histological and genetic examinations revealed a LMS (details shown in Fig. ). Follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans are shown in Figure .\nThe patient was referred to our hospital 1 year after surgery, complaining of upper abdominal discomfort and low back pain (numerical rating scale, NRS of 8). Upon admission, the patient presented with severe anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) of 65 g/L and a Karnofsky status (KPS) 70, swelling, loss of appetite, and significant weight loss (58\u201343 kg, 160 cm, body mass index 22.65\u201316.79). Plain CT scan showed multiple scattered hypodense hepatic lesions with a maximum diameter of 5.5 cm, nonhomogeneous enhancement, suspicious retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and multiple portal vein lymphadenopathy. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with a gastric LMS with multiple liver metastases and lymph node metastases (T3N0M0\u2192rM1, stage IV), as shown in Figure A.\nConsidering that the patient's physical performance and general condition may not be able to tolerate systemic chemotherapy or hepatectomy, we performed Seldinger technique transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with oxaliplatin (L-OHP) and tetrahydropalmatine (THP) emulsion with lipiodol.[ Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography showed a diffuse peritumoral vascularization of lesions located in both left and right hepatic lobes, as shown in Figure . The chemoinfusion and arterial embolization regimen are described in detail in Figure . Subsequently, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment was performed on the retroperitoneal lymphatic metastases. The size of the lesion undergone HIFU treatment was 80 \u00d7 70 \u00d7 60 mm; HIFU treatment frequency was 1 MHZ, with a focal length of 151 mm. A total of 12 layers with distance of 5 mm were treated with a sum treatment time of 729 seconds. The average power of HIFU treatment was 215 W and the total treatment energy 157,040 J. After HIFU treatment, the center position of the lesion is obvious before and after treatment, as shown in Figure . A total of 3 times of TACE were performed within 5 months and were clinically assessed as stable disease according the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST).[ The patient tolerated the procedures well and no obvious complications (greater than grade 1, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0) were observed. The follow-up CT scans showed visible lipiodol deposition and local tumor control (details and RECIST response are described and shown in Fig. B and C).\nDuring treatment, the patient complained of significant pain relief after initial treatment (NRS from 8\u20132 points). KPS improved from 70 to 80. Also, the symptoms of swelling and nausea reduced, appetite improved, and body weight increased (from 43\u201348 kg). Three months later, upon follow-ups, the patient developed loss of appetite, malnutrition, extremities weakness, and severe anemia (Hb 45 g/L). The patient complained of xiphoideusal pain while abdominal CT scan showed disease progression with multiple new lesions in both left and right hepatic lobes, as shown in Figure D. Blood transfusion and palliative care were provided for symptom relief. The patient survived for another 2 months and survived a total of 20 months after the first diagnosis of gastric lesion due to tumor progression.

For 1 year, he had suffered from excessive sleepiness characterized by multiple irresistible naps even when ambulating, episodes of sudden muscular weakness triggered by laughing, and visual hallucinations while falling asleep. The patient and his parents reportedly did not seek medical attention. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 15. His HAMA was 6 and HAMD was 4. Physical examination, regular laboratory examination, and brain magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. A polysomnographic examination showed that his sleep efficiency was 82.3%. NREM1 was 17%, NREM2 was 43%, NREM3 was 9.5%, REM was 24.5%, AHI was 1.5/h, PLMDI was 12.1/h, and RSWA was not observed. His MSLT showed a mean MSLT sleep latency of 2.6 min, fewer than 8 min, and the presence of 4 REM sleep-onset periods while napping (Figure ).\nCerebral autoregulation before treatment markedly decreased compared to the normal level (phase difference, 24 degrees in the left and 25 degrees in the right). The patient was diagnosed with narcolepsy type 1 and administered fluoxetine treatment (20 mg/d once a day in the morning). After 1 month of treatment, his clinical symptoms were relieved, and his Epworth sleep scale was 9. His cerebral autoregulation had the tendency to rise (phase difference, 45 degrees in the left and 40 degrees in the right). At the end of a 6-months follow-up period, his cataplexy symptoms occurred occasionally, and his Epworth sleep scale was 11. Simultaneously, the phase difference was 46 degrees in the left and 42 degrees in the right. The patient received venlafaxine (75 mg/d once a day in the morning) during the following month.

He had no previous medical history and did not drink alcohol or used any illicit drug or medication.\nPhysical examination on admission showed blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, a temperature of 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), a pulse rate of 90/min, and a respiratory rate of 22/min; his height was 1.75 m, weight 98 kg, and BMI 32 kg/m2. He experienced pain with deep palpation in the epigastrium and no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy was identified. The left scrotal sac was enlarged and indurated and there was a mass in the left scrotum that was indistinguishable from the left testis and provoked displacement of structures of the penis and right testis (the right scrotum was empty). No inguinal lymphadenopathy was identified.\nLaboratory tests revealed normal liver function. Hemoglobin was 9.13 g/dl, MCV was 87.9 fL, WBC was 11.9 K/uL, neutrophils were 9.81 K/uL, lymphocyte count was 1.59 K/uL, and platelet level was 252 K/uL. Serum glucose level was 106 mg/dl, BUN was 38 mg/dl, creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl, and calcium was 8.9 mg/dl.

    "question": "A 38-year-old married male working in a chemical factory presented to our outpatient department with a large pulsatile swelling of 4 months\u2019 duration on the left side of the chest. Initially, he noticed a small 4 \u00d7 4 cm swelling below the left clavicular region, which rapidly increased in size to about 10 \u00d7 10 cm in 4 months. He complained of breathlessness on climbing a normal flight of stairs. He also had a dragging sensation in the chest and hoarseness of voice since last 2 months. There was no history of preceding trauma. On enquiry, the patient gave history of sexual promiscuity in the form of multiple unprotected heterosexual intercourses with multiple partners prior to his marriage in his early twenties. The patient also gave history of painless ulcer on coronal penis with painless inguinal swelling about 20 years back following exposure for which he did not seek any medical advice. Inguinal swelling was treated by incision and drainage by a local doctor. The patient denied any history of skin rash on his body. There was no history of any neurological problem. His personal history revealed alcohol abuse and smoking.\nLocal examination showed a large well-defined pulsatile swelling on the left side of the anterior chest wall measuring about 10 \u00d7 10 cm externally []. Palpation confirmed a pulsatile swelling with bruit in some areas associated with auscultatory thrill. His general and systemic examinations including neurological examination were within normal limits. His height and weight were 156 cm and 42 kg, respectively. Cutaneous, genital, and mucosal examinations were negative for any syphilitic stigma except for the scar in the right inguinal region which corroborated with the past history of an inguinal bubo. His hemogram revealed a low hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dl with a normal white blood cell count of 5600/mm3. Serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen 16 mg/dl, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, aspartate transaminase [AST] 22 U/l, alanine transaminase [ALT] 13 U/l) including serum lipid levels and urinalysis was within a normal range. His blood serology was positive for syphilis (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test [VDRL] 1:32 and Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay [TPHA] 1:2560) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); however, serology for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. The VDRL of the cerebrospinal fluid was nonreactive. Ophthalmic examination did not show any signs of papilledema. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. His blood pressure was 180/70 mm of Hg in right upper and lower extremity. Chest roentgenogram showed widening of the mediastinum and a mass in the left upper and mid-zone with a marginal right shift of the trachea []. Computed tomography (CT)\u2013angiography revealed a saccular aneurysm of the ascending and arch of aorta of an approximate size of 8 cm penetrating through the chest wall in the left parasternal region and peripheral thrombus of 4 cm with a bony erosion of the sternum and first three ribs on the left side; however, origins of coronary arteries were spared. A three-dimensional reconstruction image of the coronal view of cardiac angiography showed aneurysm of the ascending and arch of aorta along with arch vessels []. Abdominal sonogram showed a mild degree of hepatomegaly which was consistent with the carrier stage of serum hepatitis. Two-dimensional echocardiography of the heart showed the following findings: left atrium 2.8 cm; aortic annulus 1.9 cm; left ventricular internal dimension 2.8 cm (systole); left ventricular internal dimension 3.9 cm (diastole); left ventricular septum 1.1 cm; left ventricular posterior wall 1.1 cm; ejection fraction 60%, and mild aortic regurgitation with aneurysm mainly involving the ascending and arch of aorta.\nThe patient was immediately admitted to the cardiothoracic surgery division for definitive management. Penicillin treatment given for syphilis can lead to thrombotic complications (due to the local antigen release); hence, the prophylactic course of oral steroids in the form of prednisolone 20 mg daily was advised. After a week of oral steroids; the patient was given injectable benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once a week for three consecutive weeks after intradermal sensitivity testing. The steroid cover was continued for a period of 6 weeks with a slow taper following penicillin therapy. Aneurysm was replaced with a synthetic albumin-coated Dacron graft under cardiopulmonary bypass using the technique of hypothermic circulatory arrest at 20\u201322\u00b0C/68\u00b0F. Cerebral circulation was maintained through the antegrade flow via right carotid artery cannulation. However, the patient continued to bleed through the chest tube during the postoperative period and was found to have disseminated intravascular coagulation secondary to hypothermia and multiple blood transfusions (D-dimer levels were raised). Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to death on the first postoperative day. Histopathology of the postmortem diseased aortic segment showed changes suggestive of syphilitic pathology on special stain for elastin in which elastic fibers were found to be degenerated and fragmented [].

    "question": "A 51-year-old (172 cm, 72.7 kg) man with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presented with acute neurologic decline including a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure prompting hospital admission. The patient underwent an extensive workup encompassing 28 days of persistent functional decline and progressive paralysis. The investigation concluded with a sural nerve biopsy that revealed neurolymphomatosis (DLBCL) with secondary nerve microvasculitis.\nThe decision was made to treat with 8 grams/m2 and administer 15 grams of MTX based on a CG estimated creatinine clearance of >120 mL/min calculated using a serum creatinine of <0.4 mg/dL (comparable to available creatinine values in 1 month prior to admission) and body surface area (BSA) of 1.88 m2. Unfortunately, dysautonomia associated with the neurologic syndrome precipitated a hypotensive event requiring vasopressor support and a delay of chemotherapy. This acute decompensation prompted increased scrutiny of the patient's renal function beyond standard serum creatinine measurements. A cystatin C measurement returned at 1.81 mg/L, which indicated a CKD EPICr-CysC eGFR of 69 mL/min/1.73 m2 (70 mL/min). The MTX dose was subsequently decreased by 20% to 12 grams in accordance with the impaired renal function. MTX was administered followed by leucovorin rescue according to protocol []. Routine monitoring included daily serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations, urine output, and serum MTX concentrations 48 hours after the infusion initiation and every 24 hours thereafter. On day +2 of MTX therapy, serum creatinine remained 0.4 mg/dL, cystatin C was 1.86 mg/L (CKD EPICr-CysC eGFR of 68 mL/min/1.73 m2, 74 mL/min), and the corresponding serum MTX level was 0.44 \u03bcmol/L (desired level < 0.1 \u03bcmol/L). Daily serum MTX concentrations are shown in . During this timeframe, the patient experienced mild hypokalemia, grade 1 elevation in aspartate aminotransferase without clinically evident symptoms. MTX concentrations were measured until a level of <0.1 \u03bcmol/L was achieved at day +6 at which point supportive care measures (leucovorin, intravenous fluids, sodium bicarbonate, and furosemide) were discontinued. Continued observation over the next 7 days demonstrated no change in the patient's neurologic status, and rituximab (375 mg/m2) in combination with 5 days of high-dose methylprednisolone (1 gram) were administered. Unfortunately, the patient still showed no improvement over the next several days. The decision was made to pursue comfort measures, and the patient expired soon after.

    "question": "A 50-year-old female presented to our hospital with generalized abdominal pain. The pain had been intermittent and was occurring spontaneously, every two to three weeks, for the last year. Her current episode spanned over 15 days and had gradually been increasing in intensity. The pain radiated to the back and was associated with three episodes of non-projectile, non-bilious vomiting. The pain had no association with meals. The review of systems revealed undocumented weight loss and reduced appetite. She had a history of Grade 3 ductal carcinoma of the left breast, treated with mastectomy and chemoradiotherapy 10 years previously. She had also undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 15 years ago. Family history was not significant for any illness. At the time of presentation, she was being treated for Helicobacter pylori gastritis with triple therapy. There was no history of smoking, drug, or alcohol use.\nAt the time of presentation to the emergency room (ER), the patient was in severe pain. The patient was of short stature and lean, and was visibly distressed. At the time of presentation to the ER, she was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranging from 64 to 81 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 30-40 mm Hg and tachycardic (Pulse = 131-150 bpm). She was afebrile. General physical examination revealed pallor and dehydration of conjunctival and oral mucosae. On abdominal examination, there was generalized tenderness but no guarding. Gut sounds were audible. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Resuscitation with intravenous fluids was initiated. A central venous catheter was placed to monitor fluid status and for the administration of norepinephrine. Tramadol was given to manage the pain and heparin sodium subcutaneously for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.\nLaboratory investigations revealed anemia (hemoglobin 8.9 gm/dl) and renal dysfunction (creatinine 2.2 mg/dl). Arterial blood gas suggested metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. The calculated serum osmolarity was 288 mOsm/kg and anion gap (corrected for albumin) was 26 (Table ).\nFollowing volume resuscitation, she underwent a contrast-enhanced CT scan that showed significantly distorted bowel anatomy with abnormally dilated enhancing proximal and mid-jejunal loops. The presence of a midgut volvulus, affirmed by the presence of the whirlpool sign was noted (Figure ). No congenital malrotation could be identified. The superior mesenteric artery was significantly attenuated representing occlusion, and there was non-enhancement of distal jejunal and ileal loops. These findings suggested mesenteric ischemia. There was no evidence of pneumatosis intestinalis or pneumoperitoneum. The liver was unremarkable.\nFollowing successful resuscitation, an emergency laparotomy was performed. No underlying anatomic abnormality that could direct us towards the cause of the volvulus could be identified. Therefore, a presumptive diagnosis of primary midgut volvulus was made. Approximately 250 cm of gangrenous distal jejunum, ileum and cecum were resected (Figure ). Seventy-five centimeters of duodenojejunum remained but had questionable viability in some areas. The abdomen was irrigated with three liters of fluid. The two stapled ends were left in place without an anastomosis. The fascia was not closed and the skin was approximated using towel clips.\nThe patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and extubated. During the next 48 hours, she remained hemodynamically stable off vasopressors. She was afebrile, required minimal supplemental oxygen, and produced adequate urine. Anticoagulation was maintained via heparin sodium infusion.\nShe underwent a re-look laparotomy 48 hours later. Approximately 100 cc of thin murky fluid was found in the peritoneal cavity. The residual small bowel was viable with pulsatile mesenteric vessels throughout the remaining mesentery. There were no areas of necrosis identified. A side to side functional end to end stapled anastomosis was created between the mid jejunum and ascending colon. The fascia was closed and the skin left open.\nShe was again shifted to the ICU, and extubated a day later. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was initiated. The surgical wound was open and daily dressings were done. She was transferred to a special care unit (SCU) on day 5 of admission where she remained for a day before being shifted to the ward (day 6). She maintained adequate urine output and had multiple bowel movements every day from the sixth day of admission.\nA complete nutritional assessment for this patient was done. She weighed 40 kg with a height of 155 cm, BMI of 18 kg/m2, and an ideal body weight of 48 kg. To meet her nutritional requirements, it was determined that she needed 1400-1800 kcal/day (35-45 kcal/kg/day). This was further split into 80 gm of protein, 175 gm of carbohydrates and 42 gm of fat. She was kept nil per oral (NPO) till the 2nd post-operative day, following the re-look procedure. During this time, she was kept on a TPN formula consisting of 10 gm of nitrogen, 200 gm of dextrose and 20 gm of fat, with a caloric value of 1130 kcal. Her TPN formula was subsequently adjusted to include 12 gm of nitrogen, 20 gm of fat, 260 gm of dextrose, 10 ml of multivitamin and 5 ml zinc sulfate, amounting to 1384 kcal. She was started on a soft diet on the 3rd post-operative day along with the new TPN formula. She was then progressed to a regular diet along with TPN. On the 6th post-operative day, TPN was discontinued and oral intake was supplemented with full-strength Ensure, at 200 ml twice a day. She was discharged on the 9th post-operative day on a regular diet, along with Ensure.\nOn her first visit to the outpatient clinic four days post-discharge, her weight was 35 kg and she was documented to have had multiple bowel movements (an average of four per day) at home. On subsequent monthly visits that continued for the next eight months, her weight remained fairly stable, going up to 36 kg; and she was found to be tolerating her diet well. She had no active complaints during these visits and her physical examination revealed adequate granulation tissue developing at the wound site.

    "question": "In this article, we present the case of a 54-year-old woman suffering from severe obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 47.5 kg / m2 (weight: 104 kg, height 148 m). In anamnesis, chronic bronchopathy treated with corticosteroids and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, no family history of cancer.\nShe contacted our institute for bariatric surgery. The cross-disciplinary pre-operative assessment included clinical psychology interview, dietary evaluation, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, H. pylori identification and abdominal ultrasound. All the tests were negative for pathologies and, in agreement with the patient and the cross-disciplinary team, a surgical recommendation was given. A gastric bypass with fundectomy was performed laparoscopically.\nAt one and three postoperative months the patient showed a good weight loss: 95 kg at one month with 18.3% excess weight loss (%EWL) and 8.7% total body weight loss; 84 kg at 3 months with a 40.6% EWL and 19.2% total body weight loss.\nAt nine months she had an excellent weight loss: 72 kg with a 64.9%EWL and 30.8% total body weight loss, but she reported sporadic episodes of vomiting, asthenia and poor appetite.\nThe latter symptoms are common after bariatric procedures and are compatible with the normal outcome of the bypass procedure. For this reason, the patient was scheduled for the normal follow-up at one year.\nOne year after surgery, the patient contacted the department because of a worsening of her symptoms with vomiting and asthenia. Blood tests and X-ray with Gastrografin were carried out. Blood tests revealed slight anaemia (haemoglobin: 10.5 g/dl), and the X-ray with Gastrografin showed a regular progression of the contrast medium through the gastro-jejunal anastomosis and an absence of pathological findings ().\nIn the context of initial uncertainty, it was possible to subject the patient to a full gastroscopy, thanks to this technique which allows for an easy exploration of the bypassed stomach. It showed the presence of a 6 mm antral ulcer on which biopsies were performed. The results indicated that it was an intestinal type G3 gastric adenocarcinoma. After this diagnosis, preoperative staging was performed with abdominal and thoracic CT scan with contrast dye, which resulted in negative metastasis and the gastric lesion was not visible. Cancer markers tested were in the normal range (CEA, Ca19.9 and alphafetoprotein).\nThe patient underwent laparoscopic degastroresection with D2 lymphadenectomy. The operation lasted 230 min, with no intraoperative complications. The post-operative period was normal and the patient was discharged on the fifth day.\nThe definitive histological analysis documented the presence of a gastric adenocarcinoma of the antrum pT1bN0M0 with 22 negative lymph nodes removed. After an oncological evaluation, the patient underwent standard follow-up without chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nThe follow-up at two years showed no recurrence of disease.

    "question": "This is a case of a 50 years old female patient who is known to be hypertensive, dyslipidemic, obese (BMI: 31.88-Height: 168 cm Weight: 90 kg), and operated of sleeve gastrectomy in 2012.\nOn the morning of 13/02/2013, the patient noted a near syncope episode. She was transferred to the emergency department for a fever of 39.2\u00b0C, a microcytic anemia (Hb: 7 g/dl) with elevated inflammatory markers CRP 239 mg/l and ESR 90 mm and admitted for care and investigation.\nHer physical exam showed lower limbs weakness at 4/5 proximally and distally (possible movement against gravity with moderate resistance). She was put on IV meropenem after blood and urine cultures were taken. The gram color was negative so were the cultures after 48 hours.\nOn the following morning she started complaining of paraparesia. Her physical examination showed a motor deficit of the lower limbs at 1/5 (visible contraction without any movement) with total anesthesia in all modalities (proprioceptive and thermo-algic). A D6 level was also noted.\nAn abdomino-pelvic computer tomography (CT) scan showed a complete thrombosis in the lower part of the mesenteric and the splenic veins extending to the portal bifurcation and the intrahepatic portal branches. It associated an important infiltration of the peritoneal and peri-pancreatic fat, and a mean abundance of free peri-hepatic, splenic and peri-pelvic ascites. There was a collection of 42 \u00d7 15 mm near the splenic hilum, containing a trace of contrast and a small two-fluid level. This collection seemed to communicate with the digestive tract at the gastro-esophago-jejunal anastomosis in its proximal part, suggestive of infected fistula (Figure ).\nIV heparin was added to her medications.\nAn urgent brain and cervico-dorso-lombar MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) were performed and showed:Small brain abscesses formation Figure . An extensive transverse infectious myelitis Figure .\nIn front of these findings a lumbar puncture was performed revealing 430 WBC (92% neutrophils, 7% lymphocytes, and 1% mesothelial cells) 10 RBC with hypoglycorachia and hyperproteinorachia in favor of an inflammatory liquid with polymorphic predominance of polynucleated elements. The objective of this technique was to try to isolate a bacterium. The CSF culture returned sterile and PCR BK was negative.\nAn electromyogram was normal.\nAfter this result vancomycin was added to the treatment regimen.\nClinical presentation, physical examination, and history are important diagnostic tools in assessing an acute myelopathy as the pattern of functional loss can help to determine the location of the lesion. When an acute myelopathy is suspected, a thorough neurological evaluation will help determine the region of the spinal cord affected and then the next diagnostic step is to evaluate for a compressive or structural etiology (Timothy W. []).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the complete spinal axis is mandatory in any patient with myelopathic features to exclude structural lesions, particularly those amenable to emergent neurosurgical intervention [].\nOnce neuroimaging has excluded a compressive etiology, a lumbar puncture (LP) is indicated to determine if there are signs of inflammation within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). If the CSF is non-inflammatory, then vascular, toxic/metabolic, neurodegenerative, or neoplastic myelopathies become much more likely and the subsequent work-up should focus on these etiologies. If the CSF shows signs of inflammation (pleocytosis, elevated protein concentration, oligoclonal bands, or elevated IgG index), then the subsequent work-up should focus on demyelinating, infectious, or other inflammatory causes of an acute myelitis, as the differential diagnosis is broad [].\nHowever, for elucidating the etiology of infectious myelitis, CSF studies are essential. CSF studies include cell count with differential protein and glucose concentrations. In addition, measurements of intrathecal immunoglobulin production with oligoclonal bands (OCBs) and an immunoglobulin G index or synthesis rate are very helpful when trying to determine the presence and etiology of myelitis.\nAn elevated protein concentration is the most common CSF abnormality in patients with spinal cord disease and is present in approximately 50% of patients with transverse myelitis []. A low CSF glucose concentration is defined as less than 60% of serum glucose and generally suggests fungal, bacterial, or mycobacterial infection, especially when associated with an elevated CSF white blood cell count. An isolated low CSF glucose concentration can occur in neurosarcoidosis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and even systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with CNS involvement []. The white blood cell differential can be very helpful as well. The presence of eosinophils can suggest parasitic or fungal infection, the presence of foreign material (such as surgical hardware following a spinal operation) or possibly neuromyelitis optica (NMO) (Timothy W. []).\nThe most frequent pathogens involved in transverse myelitis include Treponema palidum, Mycobacerium tuberculosis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Campylobacter jejuni, Acinetobacter baumanii, Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella henselae, Chlamydia psittaci, Leprospira, Chlamydia pneunoniae, Legionella pneumonia, Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus), Salmonella paratyphi B, Brucellosis melitensis, Group A and B streptococci [].\nIntramedullary abscess may also complicate congenital dermal sinuses or bacterial endocarditis. So a cardiac echography should be performed to exclude endocarditis.\nIn our case, a PPD, HIV serology, wright and widal all returned negative. A cardiac echography was performed and ruled out any sign for endocarditis.\nSuccessful treatment of infections of the nervous system depends on rapid and accurate diagnosis. The time course of symptom progression may suggest specific pathogens. In general, symptoms of less than 2 day\u2019s duration bespeak bacterial processes. The clinical syndrome and associated extra neural infection sites favor certain organisms [].\nEmpiric corticosteroids may be of benefit in bacterial [] and in tuberculous meningitis []. For bacterial meningitis, the typical dosing is a four-day regimen of dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg daily) started before or with the first dose of antibiotics [].\nOur patient had developed an abdominal abscess with fistula. The bacteria implicated in her myelitis are probably an enterobacteriaceae or an enterococcus. The CSF culture was negative probably because we already initiated the meropenem before the lumbar puncture was performed.\nA follow-up brain and cervico-dorsal MRI after 2 months of IV treatment (IV meropenem and vancomycine) showed: Figure .Net decrease of small contrast enhancing lesions scattered with persistence of nodular contrast right frontobasal, left upper front, in the region of the left and right thalamic lenticular ventricular junction, compared with small abscess formations in the process healing. We found a great reduction in the T2 signal abnormalities of the spinal, cervical, and thoracolumbar intramedullary spine signal. Virtual disappearance of intramedullary signal abnormality in the cervical spinal and back to a normal size.\n1 year after the myelitis and physical rehabilitation, her physical exam shows motility at 3/5 (active movement against gravity) over both her lower limbs. The sensitivity over her lower limbs is recovering but poorly over the feet. Her sphincteral dysfunction is still persistent.\nThe differential diagnosis with the infectious myelitis is one caused by autoimmune disease. A thorough workup was conducted eliminating all autoimmune diseases. The antinuclear antibodies, antibodies to extractable nuclear antigen, rheumatoid factor, antiphospholipid antibodies, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are all negative [].\nCSF and blood angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are normal.

They occurred five times per week and were associated with nocturnal awakenings. There was partial improvement with common analgesics. He was not able to stand still or walk straight without falling during the headache episodes. Ophthalmologic evaluation confirmed bilateral papilledema (), normal visual acuity, and absence of abducens nerve palsy. Cranial computed tomography revealed no mass or anatomic abnormalities. Lumbar puncture showed increased intracranial pressure of 40 cmH2O (reference value: <28 cmH2O) with a normal content. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was not performed. IIH was diagnosed. The patient was started on acetazolamide q12h with partial improvement of his symptoms. However, after three months, he was still symptomatic.\nAs he had already failed to lose weight after being enrolled in a medically supervised weight-loss program (composed of a multidisciplinary team including a nutritionist, physical therapist, psychologist, and pediatric surgeon specialized in bariatric surgery), and exhibited a bone age of a 17-year-old, we indicated bariatric surgery. During this period, he and his family were encouraged to make lifestyle changes (healthy diet and physical activity). They were also followed monthly by a psychologist. The patient was treated with sibutramine, fluoxetine, and metformin, but showed no response. Our decision was taken after considering the criteria established by the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine guidelines to undergo bariatric surgery in adolescence, which the patient fulfilled. The family formally consented, and the patient assented to the procedure.\nAt the age of 16 years and nine months, the patient underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Ophthalmologic evaluation, performed five months after surgery, revealed normal visual acuity in both eyes and improvement of bilateral papilledema (Figure 1B). Follow-up at 18 months showed a 67.5% loss of excess weight (weight: 94.5 kg and BMI: 31.2 kg/m2) and complete resolution of IIH symptoms.

The patient denied syncope, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, headache, syncope, presyncope, history of heart attack, arrhythmia, seizure, blurred vision, urinary, or bowel problems. His home medications include ibuprofen as needed for chest pain and hydralazine 25 mg per os twice daily. He has an allergy to amlodipine and enalapril causing skin rash. Family history revealed his mother had an unknown cardiac problem, and his sister had sudden cardiac death (SCD) while she was at age 30.\nInitial vital signs included temperature 98.7\u00b0F, pulse rate 96 beats per minutes, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minutes, blood pressure 130/90 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. He was put on nonrebreather mask with 40% of oxygen for hypoxia and oxygen saturation was maintained with 95%.\nPhysical examination showed fast breathing with crepitation at basal lungs. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal apex beat without any thrill or heave. The point of maximal impulse was not displaced. On auscultation, normal regular first and second heart sound without murmur, rub, or gallop was noted. Head, neck, abdominal, and neurological examinations were within normal limits.\nLaboratory tests showed normal complete blood count including normal white blood cells with differentials. Comprehensive metabolic panel revealed potassium 2.9 mmol/L, magnesium 2.7 mg/dL, sodium 136 mmol/L, chloride 101 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 28 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL, creatinine 1 mg/dL, glomerular filtration rate 90 ml/min, calcium 9 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.1 mg/dL, 3 sets of troponin 6 h apart were 0.01 ng/mL, and B type natriuretic peptide 5 pg/mL. Coagulation profile and arterial blood gasses with 40% of oxygen with nonrebreather mask were within normal limit. Computed tomography of the chest revealed moderate to marked ground glass opacities in both lung fields and normal heart size. An echocardiogram was within normal limit. He was admitted due to hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. An EKG revealed a new right bundle branch block pattern with coved ST-segment elevations and inverted T wave in leads V1-V2 consistent with Type 1 Brugada pattern EKG [].\nHypokalemia was corrected with potassium chloride 40 mEq per os once and 20 mEq twice intravenously. Rechecked potassium was 3.6 mmol/L. Six hours later, EKG was repeated and Brugada pattern EKG was disappeared, and EKG returned to its baseline [].\nThe patient was treated with antibiotics and antivirals for bilateral interstitial pneumonia likely due to viral or bacterial etiology. No other arrhythmia or reappearance of Brugada EKG pattern was found throughout hospital course. Potassium was found to be within normal limit for rest of hospital stay. No fever was noted throughout hospital course. Chest pain on admission day was thought to be pleuritic chest pain and patient was discharged. Although the patient has a strong family history of cardiac problem, patient and family members were recommended to follow-up with an electrophysiologist for drug challenge test for possible BS, but they refused. Up to 5 months after discharge, the patient was contacted over the telephone and he was in good health without any syncope, chest pain, arrhythmia, or cardiac symptoms.

    "question": "A 31-year-old male presented to the emergency room complaining of progressive dyspnea and productive cough over the course of 4 months. He also noted decreased appetite with a 50-pound weight loss over the past 5 months. He had no significant past medical or surgical history and was not taking any medications. His family history was unremarkable. He quit smoking tobacco two months ago due to worsening respiratory status; he rarely used alcohol and never used recreational drugs. He was unmarried and in a long-term heterosexual relationship and denied multiple sexual partners. He was currently working in an automobile parts factory as a janitor. After high school he had enlisted in the army and served for four years; at that time he was stationed in Hawaii. While in Hawaii he visited a single prostitute on several occasions.\nInitial vital signs revealed temperature was 99.9 F, blood pressure 128/83 mmHg, pulse 134 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 22 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. He was in moderate respiratory distress, yet was awake, alert, and cooperative. Extraocular muscles were intact; there was no nystagmus or scleral icterus. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. He had thrush under his tongue and on the palate. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Heart rate was regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops by auscultation. There were no palpable thrills. He had equal chest rise bilaterally. Breath sounds were diminished throughout, with rales and dullness to percussion in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Sensory and motor examination was grossly intact.\nLaboratory data revealed white blood count 13,900/mcL, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, platelets 370,000/mcL, sodium 131 mmol/L potassium 5.8 mmol/L, chloride 99 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 17 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 155 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 8.9 mg/dL. Arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.39, pCO2 32.2 mmHg, bicarbonate 19.1 mmol/L, and pO2 74.5 mmHg on 3 L nasal cannula. Chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities (). He was found to be HIV positive with CD4 count of <5 cells/cc and viral load of 1,180,000 copies. Bronchoalveolar lavage was preformed; Grocott's methenamine silver stain of the washings demonstrated Pneumocystis jiroveci (). He received antibiotics and steroids with gradual improvement.\nOn hospital day 14, he became confused and acutely developed nystagmus with both a horizontal and prominent vertical component. He was also found to have ataxia with finger to nose testing and difficulty sitting up without support. Considering his immunosuppressed state, infectious and neoplastic etiologies were the primary diagnostic considerations. Lumbar puncture revealed clear CSF, normal opening pressure, and normal cell counts. Polymerase chain reactions for Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and John Cunningham (JC) virus were negative. Nontreponemal serological screening for syphilis (VDRL), toxoplasmosis antibody, and Cryptococcus antigen titers were negative. CT of the head did not show any intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or other acute findings. MRI of the brain revealed a slight increase in T2 signal within the medial aspect of thalamus bilaterally (). After excluding infection and neoplasm, the clinical diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy was made. Intravenous thiamine was administered resulting in resolution of symptoms, which confirmed the diagnosis. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man visited an emergency room because of dyspnea for 1 week. Seventeen years prior to admission, he was diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukemia in another hospital. One year ago, he was admitted to this hospital with general weakness, and a bone marrow biopsy showed leukemia recurrence. The bone marrow biopsy revealed acute pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), group II with aberrant expression of CD33. Upon fluorescence in situ hybridization, p16 (CEP9) deletion on chromosome 9p21 was detected. After reinduction chemotherapy with vincristine, prednisolone, daunorubicin, and L-asparaginase (VPDL), he achieved a hematological but not a cytogenetic response. Upon admission, no specific sign was present except tachypnea, (respiratory rate 36 breaths/min). Blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 100 bpm, and body temperature was 36.9\u2103. No hepatomegaly was noted.\nLaboratory data showed pH 7.206, PaCO2 11.7 mmHg, PaO2 131.3 mmHg, bicarbonate 4.5 mmol/L, and base excess -21.1. Serum sodium was 133 mEq/L, potassium 4.1 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, and the anion gap was 19.3 mEq/L. The complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell of 3,200/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 83,000/\u00b5L. The differential count showed 61% neutrophils, 27% lymphocytes, 11% immature cells, 1% band neutrophils, and no basophils, eosinophils or monocytes. The coagulation profile was within the normal range. Blood chemistry showed 17 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.8 mg/dL creatinine, 4.5 g/dL albumin, 8 IU/L aspartate aminotransferase, 5 IU/L alanine aminotransferase, 0.67 mg/dL total bilirubin, and 302 IU/L lactate dehydrogenase. C-reactive protein was 1.34 mg/dL. The random plasma glucose level in the emergency room was 179 mg/dL. Peripheral blood morphology examination showed 20% blasts with some spherocytes and tear drop cells. Serum thiamine level was 18.60 ng/mL (normal range, 21.3-81.9 ng/mL). A chest radiography showed no active infiltrative lesions.\nContinuous bicarbonate replacement therapy was performed to maintain cardiovascular stability. Arterial blood gas analysis improved to pH 7.346, PaCO2 20.1 mmHg, PaO2 135.2 mmHg, H CO3- 10.7 mmol/L, and base excess of -12.3 mmol/L. The blood lactate level was not checked in the emergency room. On day 3 of admission, a bone marrow biopsy was performed, and the result showed that ALL was sustained. Re-induction chemotherapy with vincristine and prednisone (VP) regimen was started immediately. Lactate was 11.6 mmol/L on day 2 of chemotherapy. After 3 weeks, lactate level decreased to 4.6 mmol/L.\nAfter finishing the chemotherapeutic schedule, leukemic blasts still showed on the follow-up bone marrow examination, and the number and percentage of blast cells in the peripheral blood started to increase. As the number of immature cells in peripheral blood increased, the lactic acid began to increase again. The serum lactic acid level fluctuated from 12 to 20 mmol/L, regardless of bicarbonate replacement. However, the patient was asymptomatic and blood pH remained neutral without bicarbonate replacement therapy. On day 147 of admission, the patient expired as a result of disease progression combined with uncontrolled infection. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 40-year-old woman came to the emergency room, accompanied by her mother, complaining of the progressive development of severe asthaenia, diffuse muscular pain and malaise. \u2018I feel like I\u2019m going to die\u2019, she said repeatedly, \u2018even if I do not know why\u2019.\nAt admission, the clinical evaluation revealed a collaborative, suffering, lean and hypotensive woman (blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, last reported body weight 55 kg, height 175 cm), with normal heart rate (76 bpm, rhythmic), who was severely asthaenic. She looked dehydrated and her skin was diffusely hyperpigmented with hypertrichosis.\nShe denied any major problem in her past clinical history. The recent clinical history was also uneventful, except for an episode of gastroenteritis, about 10 days previously, after which she slowly improved for a few days, followed by the progressive development of the presenting complaints. Renal ultrasounds, performed in the emergency room, revealed kidneys of normal size, without signs of obstruction. Chest X-ray was normal. The patient was oligoanuric; she reported decreasing urinary output in the last few days and catheterization yielded <50 mL of urine. The EKG is shown in .\nNo previous blood test was available and the patient recalled having performed the last ones a few years before, when, on the occassion of the death of her father, she had undergone a general evaluation for having lost \u2018considerable weight\u2019.\nThe first blood tests performed in the emergency room revealed: serum creatinine, 5.55 mg/dL, active inflammatory signs [C-reactive protein, 41.2 mg/dL (normal < 0.8 mg/dL); fibrinogen, 938 mg/dL], massive leukocytosis (WBC, 67 000), suggestive of both severe haemoconcentration and infection, with severe sodium and potassium imbalance (Na, 107 mmol/L; K, 1.61 mmol/L), moderate, compensated metabolic acidosis (pH, 7.34; HCO3, 19.4 mmol/L; base excess, \u22124 mmol/L) and moderate hyperglycaemia (160 mg/dL). Haemoglobin level (15 g/dL) was normal. Elevated levels of creatinine\u2013phosphokinase (26 186 UI/L) indicated concomitant rhabdomyolysis, probably as a result of infection and severe electrolyte imbalance, potentially contributing to the acute renal failure.\nIn the face of the complex metabolic disorder, a hierarchy of interventions was defined, starting from potassium supplementation with very slow sodium infusion, aimed at raising the sodium level by no more than 10\u201312 mEq/day. As it will be further discussed, the working diagnostic hypotheses are of an acute renal failure superimposed on a chronic kidney disease in the context of diuretic abuse. In spite of the need for rapid correction of the potassium and sodium levels, each of the interventions has, however, important limits and drawbacks and the anuric status limits the use of the most widely employed formulae guiding assessment and therapy in severe sodium imbalance ()\nAbout 12 h after admission, in the absence of cognitive deficits, she suddenly developed flaccid tetraplegia and restrictive respiratory failure. A prompt transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) was required because of respiratory failure. She was sedated and mechanical ventilation was started.\nAt transfer to the ICU and immediately after intubation (pO2, 193 mmHg; pCO2, 35.4 mmHg), the major electrolyte levels were the following: Na, 114 mmol/L; K, 0.8 mmol/L; HCO3, 15 mmol/L; lactate, 0.8 mmol/L; chloride, 83 mmol/L; ionized calcium, 1.16 mmol/L; pH, 7.255; base excess, \u221212 mmol/L; anion gap, 17 mmol/L. Calculated osmolarity was 278 mOsm/kg (according to the simplified formula: Osmolality = Sodium \u00d7 2 + Glucose/18 + BUN/2.8), the effect of the low sodium being partly counterbalanced by the high BUN (BUN, 116 mg/dL).\nOn account of the recent gastrointestinal viral disease, the flaccid paralysis with intact sensorium and the rapid course, the neurologist suspected Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and performed a lumbar puncture, leading to a picture of albuminocytological dissociation (WBC, 7 mm3; proteins, 63 mg/dL; glucose, 90 mg/dL). In parallel with the slow correction of the electrolyte imbalance (), leading also to slow volume repletion, high-dose immunoglobulins were started (0.4 mg/kg/day for 5 days), with prompt clinical improvement and discharge from the ICU 7 days later, to be transferred to the internal medicine ward.\nDiuresis gradually restarted in the following 12 h, reaching 800 mL by the second day. In keeping with the hypothesis of chronic kidney disease with impaired concentration ability, urinalysis showed low urine specific gravity (1010) and relatively high spot urinary sodium (39 mEq/L, with serum sodium, 121 mEq/L).\nAt discharge from the internal medicine ward 2 weeks later, serum creatinine was 1.38 mg/dL, BUN 16 mg/dL, creatinine clearance (24-h urine collection) ranged from 50 to 60 mL/min, proteinuria ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 g/day, Na 141 mmol/L, K 4.5 mmol/L, HCO3 24 mEq/L and PCR 0.04; urinalysis was normal. Renal ultrasounds revealed a decreased corticomedullary differentiation and slightly decreased thickness of the renal cortex, in keeping with the presence of chronic parenchymal disease; the presence of markedly hyperechogenic papillae is suggestive of nephrocalcinosis.

He presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of decreasing urine output, increased shortness of breath, generalized weakness, and nausea. He initially received his DDKT in 2010, which has been complicated by multiple episodes of both acute T cell-mediated and acute antibody-mediated rejection. The patient admitted to a two-month history of immunosuppressive medication nonadherence with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone.\nPhysical examination revealed a young male, in no distress, weighing 142 pounds. He had a blood pressure of 153/102 mmHg and a heart rate of 77 beats/min. Exam findings are as follows: pale conjunctiva, lungs clear to auscultation, regular heart rate and rhythm, active bowel sounds, no abdominal tenderness, and no focal neurological deficit. Admission labs included a serum creatinine of 64.6 mg/dL (0.67\u20131.17 mg/dL) with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 212 mg/dL (6\u201320 mg/dL), which increased to a serum creatinine of 73.8 mg/dL and BUN of 244 mg/dL prior to initiation of emergent dialysis. Serum chemistry included sodium 137 mmol/L (136\u2013145 mmol/L), potassium 6.0 mmol/L (3.5\u20135.1 mmol/L), chloride 98 mmol/L (98\u2013107 mmol/L), total carbon dioxide 7 mmol/L (22\u201329 mmol/L), glucose 68 mg/dL (74\u2013106 mg/dL), and phosphorus 14.7 mg/dL (2.7\u20134.5 mg/dL).\nThe patient was initiated on emergent dialysis via a temporary dialysis catheter. Dialysis was complicated by new onset of seizures, initially thought to be secondary to dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed showing right temporal spikes epileptiform discharges with intermittent slow waves lateralized to the right hemisphere. Patient was thought to have epilepsy with initial seizure exacerbation secondary to severe metabolic derangements in setting of acute renal failure and severe azotemia. He was initiated on daily levetiracetam with resolution of seizures.\nPatient received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) while in the intensive care unit. After stabilization of his acute medical issues, a tunneled dialysis catheter was placed in his right internal jugular vein prior to discharge. Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with renal allograft failure secondary to medication nonadherence and was discharged home on intermittent hemodialysis with improvement in serum creatinine to 23.8 mg/dL and BUN of 76 mg/dL at time of discharge, after completion of four hemodialysis sessions.

    "question": "A 59-year-old African American man presented to the emergency department in moderate distress, complaining of severe, diffuse abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, chills, diaphoresis, and constipation. The pain had started 1 week prior as a dull ache, worsened for several days, and became severe with stabbing abdominal pain the day of admission. Family history was positive for cancer in his father and mother as well as 3 siblings, but he was unaware of their diagnoses, except that one brother had prostate and \u201cbowel cancer.\u201d He had a 12 pack-year smoking history and was a current smoker. Physical examination demonstrated he was diffusely tender in his abdomen and had involuntary guarding consistent with peritonitis.\nVitals were as follows: temperature 36.8\u00b0C, pulse 138 beats/minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, and blood pressure 118/66 mm Hg. Laboratory evaluation showed a total white blood cell count of 6.55 \u00d7 103/mm3, 24% neutrophils, 52% bands, 5% lymphocytes, albumin 3.1 g/dL, sodium 132 mmol/L, potassium 3.1 mmol/L, chloride 93 mmol/L, bicarbonate 30 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 26 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, and the rest of the values were normal. CT imaging of the abdomen demonstrated free intraperitoneal air and small bowel thickening, as well as intraperitoneal extravasation of contrast into the left upper quadrant (), indicating bowel perforation. CT imaging also showed lymphadenopathy of the chest and abdomen and 2 pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe measuring up to 1.1 cm in maximal diameter ().\nExploratory laparotomy exposed a small bowel perforation related to a full-thickness mass of the jejunum. In addition, there were multiple palpable intraluminal masses approximately every 10 cm throughout the jejunum. Diffuse retroperitoneal, pelvic, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Two areas of small bowel were resected, one segment where the bowel had perforated and a second that was nearly perforated. The serosa of the second area was thin and friable, consistent with impending perforation.\nHistopathology of the resected specimens revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma with transmural involvement of the small intestine, with mucosal ulceration, necrosis, and perforation (). The lymphatic vessels were markedly dilated and engorged with malignant cells. Tumor was present at proximal, distal, and mesenteric resection margins. There were areas of prominent serosal inflammation with exudates, consistent with peritonitis. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7; ), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1; ), and napsin A () and were negative for CD20, CDX2, P63, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56. A special stain for mucin was positive. Altogether, the biopsy stainings were consistent with a pathological diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma from a pulmonary primary.\nHis postoperative hospital course was unremarkable. He was discharged on postoperative day 5 with home care. At home, he had occasional fatigue, night sweats, insomnia, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, as well as weight loss (4 kg in 2 weeks and a cumulative 23 kg loss from his normal set point) and alternating diarrhea and constipation. He met with medical oncology who ordered further imaging studies, bronchoscopy, molecular testing of the tumor, and chemotherapy. He was readmitted 1 month after surgery for dehydration and weakness with a deteriorating functional status. After aggressive fluid resuscitation and electrolyte repletion he was discharged, but he was readmitted 2 weeks later with severe and worsening abdominal pain. He was very ill appearing, with leukocytosis, critical lactic acidosis, and acute renal failure. CT of the abdomen confirmed free air and the presence of another small bowel perforation with a large amount of fluid in the abdomen. The chance of a meaningful recovery was exceedingly slim. After a discussion with the patient and his family, comfort measures were instituted to allow natural death. He died 7 weeks after his initial presentation.

    "question": "A 21-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department 4 hours after taking 20 tablets of CBS in a suicide attempt. Each tablet included 300 mg of CBS, which is equivalent to 120 mg of Bi2O3. There was no alcohol or another intravenous drug usage. In the emergency service, the patient underwent gastric lavage and received intravenous fluid therapy, after which she was admitted to the internal medicine intensive care unit.\nPhysical examination upon admission was unremarkable: blood pressure, 100/60 mm Hg; pulse, 76 beats/minute; respiration rate, 12 breaths/minute; and body temperature, 36.5\u00b0C. Laboratory tests were as follows: white blood cell count, 7860/mm3; hemoglobin, 10.8 g/dL; platelet count, 445,000/mm3; serum sodium, 141 mEq/L; potassium, 4.3 mEq/L; chloride, 104 mEq/L; glucose, 108 mg/dL; amylase, 85 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 35 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 14 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 150 U/L; hepatitis B surface antigen, nonreactive; and anti-hepatitis C virus, nonreactive. Her INR was reported to be normal at 1.1. Thyroid function tests were normal. Chest radiography also showed no abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated slightly increased echogenicity in the renal parenchyma. Electrocardiography and echocardiography findings were normal. The patient rapidly became oliguric (<500 mL/day) and thereafter was anuric (0 mL/day). Blood creatinine increased to 2.6 mg/dL (blood urine nitrogen [BUN], 8 mg/dL) during the first 24 hours and to 3.1 mg/dL (BUN, 11 mg/dL) the next day. The baseline creatinine value was normal. Nevertheless, levels of LDH, ALT, and AST were elevated at 1,129 U/L, 62 U/L, and 139 U/L, respectively. Her scleraes were anicteric. The abdomen was soft, flat, and without palpable organomegaly. There was no edema. Arterial blood gases showed metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, PaO2 of 80 mmHg, BE of \u221211 mmol/L, and HCO3 of 14 mmol/L. Blood chemistry and urine sediment showed signs of proximal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi\u2019s syndrome) with hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, metabolic acidosis, and renal glycosuria despite normal plasma glucose concentration.\nAfter consultation with personnel at Turkey\u2019s National Poison Information Center, we started oral treatment with the chelating agent sodium-2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS), which is related structurally to 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (dimercaprol, also known as British anti-Lewisite), using the following regimen: DMPS, 600 mg orally every 8 hours for 14 days. Hemodialysis was performed because of anuria and severe metabolic acidosis. Hemodialysis was conducted daily for the first 4 days and then three times weekly. Arterial blood gases returned to normal. Afterwards, the patient\u2019s urine output progressively increased. Levels of LDH, ALT, and AST also returned to normal. The patient recovered clinically and was discharged after 15 days in hospital. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 5.2 mg/dL and 20.0 mg/dL, respectively. Eight weeks after discharge, the patient\u2019s renal function (serum creatinine and BUN) test results remained high. The patient is still on hemodialysis approximately 1 year later.

    "question": "A two-year-old male child presented with an inability to walk since the age of one year. He was born to nonconsanguineous parents, the birth weight was 2.8 kg and he had normal early physical and mental milestones. He was able to stand and walk at 10 months, but within next few weeks he was unable to walk and stand even with support. A frontal bossing, potbelly appeared and there was a failure to gain height. He received calcitriol 0.25 \u03bcg on alternate days and elemental calcium 1 g /day, but showed no improvement.\nOn examination, he was irritable and blood pressure was 100/65 mmHg. He had no edema or pallor and anterior frontanelle was still open. He had classical features of rickets [] such as frontal bossing, widened epiphysis at wrist, rickety rosary, potbelly and bowlegs. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Anthropometry showed height 73 cm, (5th percentile), weight 9 kg (5th percentle), head circumference 48 cm (between 75 and 90th percentile).\nLaboratory evaluation showed the following: Urine albumin-trace, sugar-nil, microscopy-no sediments; Hemoglobin 12.3 g/dl, Blood urea 21 mg/dl, serum creatinine 0.3 mg/ dl, serum sodium 137 mEq/l, serum potassium 3.4 mEq/l, serum chloride 99 mEq/l, serum bicarbonate 22 mEq/l, serum calcium 8.9 mg/dl, serum phosphate 2.0 mg/ dl (normal values for children: 4.5-6.5 mg/ dl), serum alkaline phosphatase 3966 IU/l and serum intact PTH 26.5 pg/ml (normal: 10-54). Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.353, pCO2 27.0 mmHg, pO2 114.3 mmHg, HCO3 14.6 mmol/l and simultaneous urine pH was 8.0. X-ray of wrists showed fraying and splaying of metaphyses of distal ulna and radius, old healed fractures of distal shaft of radius. Ultrasound of abdomen showed normal sized kidneys with multiple hyperechoic foci within, suggestive of calcification []. X-ray of abdomen showed no evidence of calcification in the region of kidneys.\nA diagnosis of hypophosphatemic rickets was made and was evaluated further. The 24-h urine protein excretion was 542.8 mg/day, phosphate excretion was 437 mg/ day, \u03b22-microglobulin excretion was 37.6 mg/ day (normal < 0.2 mg/day) and calcium excretion was 82.8 mg/day (9mg/kg/day). Examination of urine showed generalized aminoaciduria. A diagnosis of Dent's disease was made, since he met the following criteria: male gender, rickets, severe hypercalciuria (9 mg/ kg/ day), LWMP (\u03b22-microglobulin), hypophosphatemia, phosphaturia and nephrocalcinosis.\nHe received potassium citrate (potassium citrate monohydrate 220 mg and citric acid monohydrate 67 mg per ml) 3 ml twice daily, calcitriol 0.25 \u03bcg on alternate days, hydrochlorothiazide 6.125 mg twice daily and sodium phosphate (Proctoclysis enema preparation; sodium dihydrogen phosphate 16%, sodium phosphate 6%, 1 ml contains approximately 50 mg of elemental phosphorus) 1 ml orally thrice daily. The dose of drugs was adjusted periodically to achieve targets. At one year, he was on sodium phosphate 1 ml five times daily, potassium citrate 4 ml thrice daily, calcitriol 0.25 \u03bcg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 6.125 mg twice daily. The details of anthropometric and biochemical measures before and after therapy are shown in . At one year, there was a marked improvement in his mobility; he was able to walk and run and the bony deformities had improved significantly. There was a gain in height and weight, serum phosphorus was near normal and serum alkaline phosphatase was reduced by 50%. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 74-yr-old woman was transferred to our emergency department from the local general hospital with an initial diagnosis of brain stem infarct on January 17, 2009. The patient was found unconscious and in a bed-ridden state during the early morning on the presenting day. The patient's breathing was shallow and irregular. The patient was unable to walk well due to a coccyx fracture two years ago, but she was able to perform daily life activities with minor help. One week ago, her facial edema started and she complained dry cough and general weakness three days ago. No other medical, familial, or social history was reported, and the patient had not taken any medication. There was also no evidence of intoxication.\nAccording to the records of the local general hospital, the patient had an impending respiratory arrest and comatose mental status. Her blood pressure was 71/48 mmHg, her body temperature was 36.0\u2103, and her pulse rate was 99 beats/min with a sinus rhythm by electrocardiography (ECG). Neurologic examination revealed pinpoint pupils and a lack of brain stem reflexes, including the light reflex, corneal reflex, gag reflex, and doll's-eye phenomenon. She also showed decerebrated rigidity in response to painful external stimuli. The patient was assigned a score of 5 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, and the Babinski sign was detected at both feet. Brain computed tomography (CT) produced unremarkable results. Endotracheal intubation was performed for protection of the patient's airway, assisted ventilation was initiated, and an inotropic agent was injected to support the patient's state of shock, which did not respond to fluid therapy (1 L of normal saline). Prior to transfer, the patient's blood pressure was increased, but her neurologic findings were not improved. She was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment of a brain stem infarct.\nOn arrival, the patient's blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg, her pulse rate was 59 beats/min, and an intravenous infusion of premixed dopamine was administered (500 mL/800 mg, 20 \u00b5g/kg/min). The patient's body temperature was 34.8\u2103 according to a tympanic membrane thermometer, and her self-respiration was slow and shallow. The patient's lungs on auscultation were bilaterally clear, and cardiac examination showed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The patient's abdomen was soft without signs of guarding, tenderness, or rebound tenderness. A rectal examination revealed no masses, and the patient's stool was guaiac negative. No soiling due to urine or feces was noted on her undergarments.\nThe patient's face and extremities were edematous, and she presented with non-pitting edema. Her skin was dry, cool, pale, and slightly mottled and desquamated; however, there was no evidence of petechiae or purpura ().\nThe patient's level of consciousness was stupor to semi-coma. A neurologic examination revealed intact cranial nerves and she didn't show lateralizing signs. The patient's pupils were 3 mm across and briskly reactive. It was impossible to check for visual abnormalities and focal cerebellar findings. The results of the Babinski reflex test were negative.\nThe patient's laboratory values were as follows: WBC count 6,000/\u00b5L (86% neutrophils), hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, sodium 121 mEq/L, potassium 4.2 mEq/L, chloride 87 mEq/L, BUN 1.3 mg/dL, creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, glucose 104 mg/dL, ALT 113 U/L, AST 74 U/L, albumin 3.3 g/dL, CK 499 IU/L, CK-MB 21.4 ng/mL, troponin-I <0.02 ng/mL, lactate 1.2 mM/L, urine RBCs 1-4/HPF, and urine WBCs 0-1.5/HPF. Arterial blood gas analysis (FiO2 1.0) revealed a pH of 7.486, a pCO2 of 30.6 mmHg, a pO2 of 36.4 mmHg, a HCO3- concentration of 22.9 mM/L, and an oxygen saturation of 77%.\nA portable chest radiography revealed infiltration of the right lower lung zone and cardiomegaly. ECG revealed sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia; the intervals and axis were normal except for a prolonged QTc interval. Echocardiography revealed a small amount of pericardial effusion, but it did not affect the patient's hemodynamic status.\nDuring our resuscitative efforts, the patient's blood pressure didn't respond and additional laboratory test results confirmed hypothyroidism. The patient's free thyroxine was 0.05 ng/dL (0.93-1.7) and her TSH was 30.12 \u00b5IU/mL (0.27-5.0). A diagnosis of myxedema coma exacerbated by community-acquired pneumonia was thus assigned.\nThe patient was referred to the Department of Endocrinology and admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment and ventilatory support. The patient received 1,000 \u00b5g of levothyroxine orally for two days, followed by 300 \u00b5g/day for an additional three days and finally maintained on levothyroxine 0.1 mg orally each day. Following the administration of synthetic thyroid hormones for hypothyroidism and antibiotics for pneumonia, the patient regained consciousness and respiration. She was transferred to a general ward after two weeks in the intensive care unit and discharged from the hospital one week later. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 63-year-old G2P2 female presented ambulatory to the ED with the chief complaint of abdominal pain, described further to the triage nurse as abdominal cramping and a mass in her vagina. The patient described that she had had a \"bulge\" in her vagina for the past 2 years and was currently being treated by her gynecologist for an enterocele with estrogen cream. Elective surgical repair of an enterocele was planned. She complained to the triage nurse of abdominal pain intermittently for the preceding 1 week. She stated that when she coughed something protruded from her vagina and she believed that her rectum had prolapsed. She was initially triaged to the lower acuity area of the emergency department, but due to worsening pain, she was brought back to a room on the acute care side approximately 30 min after her arrival. She described working in her garden when she coughed, experiencing a \"bulge\" extending through and out of her vagina. According to the patient, this \"bulge\" had been worsening for 2 months but had never extended past her labia. The patient complained of severe cramping in the left lower quadrant of her abdomen, but denied any diffuse abdominal pain. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension and breast cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy without radiation. The patient did not have a history of vaginal or vulvar cancer. Her surgical history was significant for mastectomy and breast reconstruction, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral oopherectomy (5 years previously), and pubovaginal sling (4 years previously).\nOn examination she was pleasant, appearing well and in no acute distress, with a temperature of 36.8 C\u00b0, pulse of 70, and blood pressure of 142/97 mmHg. Initial abdominal examination demonstrated no tenderness to palpation and no peritoneal signs. On genitourinary exam approximately 15 cm of small bowel protruded through the vaginal introitus (see Figure ). The bowel exhibited peristaltic waves and was dark red in color. Manual reduction was attempted to reduce strangulation, but was unsuccessful because of the large amount of bowel present and to the patient's discomfort during the attempt. Intravenous morphine was administered for pain control. Sterile moist gauze was placed over the eviscerated bowel, and the gynecology department was immediately consulted for surgical management of the patient. The patient was given a bolus of 1 l normal saline and intravenous ertapenam and metronidazole to cover enteric organisms.\nLaboratory data results included white blood cell count, 5.9 k/ul; hemoglobin, 13.1 g/dl; hematocrit, 38.6%; platelets, 287 k/ul; prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal. Sodium was 142 mEq/l; chloride, 109 mEq/l; potassium, 3.8 mEq/l; bicarbonate 23 mEq/l; glucose, 123 mg/dl; blood urea nitrogen, 17 mg/dl; creatinine, 0.7 mg/dl; calcium 9.3 mg/dl. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, with left atrial enlargement.\nWhile awaiting surgical consultation and 45 min after being placed in a room, the patient developed relative hypotension; her blood pressure decreased from 183/108 to 107/63 mmHg. She became less responsive and experienced rigors. Repeat abdominal exam showed diffuse abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs that rapidly progressed to frank peritonitis. The herniated bowel had become dark and dusky. A second large bore IV was placed, and aggressive fluid resuscitation with 2 l normal saline was initiated. Her bed was placed in the Trendelenburg position to reduce tension on the eviscerated bowel, and preparations were made to intubate the patient because of her rapid decline. The fluid resuscitation was successful in improving her mental status and blood pressure, and she did not require intubation. She was transported quickly to the operating room for repair by both gynecology and general surgery physicians. General surgery resected approximately 20 cm of the distal ileum, which they noted to be inflamed and thickened with two areas of ischemia. This was followed by resection and repair of the vaginal cuff by gynecologic surgery. The patient was discharged from the hospital 6 days later in improved condition.

She was the first child of a nonconsanguineous couple, the father of Greek descent and the mother of French Canadian origin. The parents reported that she often appeared thirsty and woke up in the night to drink, soaking 6\u20138 diapers per day. She was not tolerating solid foods well but had no chronic diarrhea.\nHer weight was 7.940 kg (z-score \u22123.2) and height was 77 cm (z-score \u22120.88). Her development was significantly delayed; she was barely able to sit and was unable to walk. She made only babbling sounds, was very irritable, and did not interact normally with others.\nLaboratory testing revealed a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate = 14.7 mmol/L) with hypokalemia (K+ = 2.6 mmol/L). Other serum values included: sodium = 133 mmol/L, chloride = 108 mmol/L, calcium = 2.46 mmol/L, phosphate = 1.3 mmol/L, creatinine = 45 \u03bcmol/L, and normal PTH (3.9 pmol/L). Red blood cell morphology was normal, but urine pH (7.5) was inappropriately high. There was no evidence of proteinuria or glucosuria, and tubular reabsorption of phosphate (81%) was only marginally decreased.\nTo formally assess distal renal tubular acidification, a sodium bicarbonate loading test was performed (1 mmol/kg of sodium bicarbonate was infused over 30 minutes). Distal RTA was confirmed by: (A) abnormally low urine minus plasma pCO2 < 30 mmHg; (B) positive urinary anion gap (UAG = UNa + UK \u2212 UCl) indicating absence of ammonium ion; (C) correction of serum bicarbonate from 18.8 to 20.6 meq/L with 1 mmol/kg NaHCO3 (). Her renal ultrasound showed bilateral nephrocalcinosis ().\nAlthough distal RTA was thought to explain her failure to thrive, her developmental delay was initially attributed to a familial form of autism since this diagnosis had been made in a maternal cousin and initial audiometry was inconclusive because of poor cooperation. However, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked enlargement of the endolymphatic sac bilaterally. On the right, the sac measured 15 \u00d7 19 mm in transverse and craniocaudal dimensions, respectively (). Subsequent otoacoustic emission and audiograms () confirmed absent hearing in the right ear (<80 dB) with residual hearing (2\u201325 dB) on the left. We sequenced all ATP6V1B1 exons and identified a putative pathogenic mutation on each allele (IVS7 + G > T/p420fs434X).\nThe patient started oral potassium citrate therapy (3 mmol citrate/kg per day). Her acidosis and hypokalemia resolved over the next 6 months, and she had good catch-up growth reaching weight z-scores of \u22121.12 (13% ile) by 2 years of age. Following interventions by the speech therapist, gross motor milestones, socialization, and speech have improved. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 36-year-old female smoker presented to the emergency department with epigastric abdominal pain, radiating to her back, of 1 week duration. Her past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes for which she was on oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin; presumed secondary HTG for which she was on atorvastatin and gemfibrozil; furthermore, she used medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception. She had stopped all these medications except the contraceptive 12 months prior to her presentation. The patient has no history of alcohol abuse, thyroid dysfunction, or family history of HTG. On admission, all vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was normal except for epigastric tenderness and a BMI of 31.4 kg/m2.\nThe initial relevant laboratory testing revealed sodium of 129 meq/l, potassium 3.7 meq/l, chloride 97 meq/l, BUN 10 mg/dl, creatinine 0.77 mg/dl (at baseline), bicarbonate 13.7 meq/l, anion gap 18 meq/l, glucose of 324 mg/dl, amylase 31 IU/l, lipase 206 IU/l, and TG 2,329 mg/dl with a previous baseline of around 2,000 mg/dl, serum calcium 9.0 mg/dl, TSH 1.182 \u00b5IU/ml, serum lactate 1.8 meq/l, negative urine ketones with serum beta-hydroxybutyrate 0.16 mmol/l, and negative urine pregnancy test. The abdominal computerized tomography scan showed no definite evidence of pancreatitis or any other pathology.\nDespite unremarkable imaging, normal amylase, mild elevation of lipase, and a TG level that was mildly elevated from previous baseline, she was treated for possible HTGP with IV insulin based on the overall clinical picture. The differential diagnosis includes diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); however, the patient lacked serum or urinary ketones. Regardless, IV insulin would treat both conditions of HTGP and DKA. The clinical impression of HTGP was further supported when her lipase increased to 370 IU/L and the TG levels on the initial sample was re-assayed resulting in a corrected reading of >10,000 mg/dl. The TG levels decreased to 6,069 mg/dl with IV insulin on day 5. However, given the worsening abdominal pain, plan for plasmapheresis to rapidly reduce the TG levels was taken. The TG levels decreased to 2,055 mg/dl after the first exchange and to 642 mg/dl after the second session, and her symptoms improved significantly. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 72-year-old man suffered from a fever, diarrhea, pneumaturia, and fecaluria beginning in April 2013 and referred to our hospital in May 2013. He was hospitalized due to the symptom of abdominal distension. The abdominal X-ray showed dilated small intestine indicating mechanical bowel obstruction (Fig. ). The night of first hospital day, he developed a loss of consciousness, and the next morning, he developed whole body cramping. The patient had no previous history of hepatic disease and no episodes of confusion or neurological disorders. He was no taking any medications for any diseases.\nThe laboratory data indicated an inflammatory reaction with the elevation of the white blood cells count of 23,600/\u03bcl and a C-reactive protein concentration of 7.33 mg/dl and hyperchloremic acidosis, with Na 144 mEq/l, K 3.1 mEq/l, Cl 116 mEq/l, pH 7.116, PO2 145 mmHg, PCO2 34 mmHg, BE \u221216.8 \u03bcmol/l, and HCO3\u2212 11.3 \u03bcmol/l. Furthermore the serum ammonia (NH3) level was highly elevated to 703 \u03bcg/dl.\nThe level of tumor markers, CEA and CA19-9, were elevated at 7.9 ng/ml and 43.6U/ml, respectively. The liver and renal functions were normal. The culture of urine indicated the existence of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nContrast computed tomography (CT) indicated the huge tumor occupying minor pelvic space which was suspected to invade the ureter and urinary bladder (Fig. a). Two liver metastases with the sizes of 1.1 and 1.2 cm were also observed (Fig. b and c).\nA water-soluble contrast enema showed rectovesical fistulae as well as ileal fistulae (Fig. a, b). Colonoscopy indicated the presence of a rectal carcinoma occupying total space at 15 cm far from the anal verge (Fig. ). The biopsy of the tumor indicated well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\nWe administered a solution of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and antibiotics. Furthermore, we repeatedly irrigated the bladder through the urethral catheter. The patient\u2019s symptoms recovered, and serum ammonia levels on second and third hospital day were decreased to 210 and 135 \u03bcg/dl, respectively. However, the symptoms of infection and confusion were suspected to repeat; we elected to perform a surgical treatment.\nOn the operative findings, ascites and disseminated tumors were not observed. However, the tumor could not be resected due to the invasive growth in the minor pelvic space. The surgical procedure we adopted was as follows. We disconnected both oral and anal sides of ileum which was involved in the tumor and made an ileocecal bypass. Furthermore, we performed sigmoidostomy to prevent feces pouring into the urinary bladder.\nWe continued irrigation of urinary bladder through the bladder catheter after the operation. The postoperative clinical course was no eventful. Serum ammonia values had been kept under 120 \u03bcg/dl.\nHe was treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin/capecitabine) for 11 cycles. However, massive ascites had been developed 1 year after the operation, and the patient died from peritoneal metastases.\nThe vesicular catheter had been kept during the whole period after operation, and hyperammonemia had never occurred.\nIt has been noted that a urinary diversion may sometimes be the cause of non-hepatic hyperammonemic encephalopathy []. However, the frequency of this complication is not known and considered to be extremely rare. Some cases have been reported in patients who underwent a urinary diversion due to bladder or prostate cancer []. To the best of our knowledge, only one case with rectal cancer was previously reported in the Japanese literature, in which the patient suffered from a rectovesical fistula and liver dysfunction due to multiple liver metastases [].\nApproximately 10 % (17/178) of the patients who underwent surgical treatment to create an ileal conduit developed hyperchloremic acidosis according to the report by Schmitt et al. []. However, hyperammonemic encephalopathy was not observed in several reviews on the complications of urinary diversion [\u2013]. Urea-splitting urinary tract infection has been noted to be crucial for the development of hyperammonemic encephalopathy [].\nAn elevation of the blood ammonia levels may result from the diversion of the urinary stream to the intact intestine, which provides an additional amount of ammonia that must be absorbed, especially when there is urine stasis in the bowel. Urea in the bowel is converted by urea-splitting bacteria to form ammonia. Ammonia chloride is generally reabsorbed and broken down to liberate free ammonia and hydrochloric acid. In the absence of liver dysfunction, the additional ammonia can be managed by the liver; however, in a damaged liver, the extra ammonia cannot be managed, resulting in hyperammonemia. Even with a normal liver function, urease-producing bacteria may form large amounts of ammonia, thereby, leading to hyperammonemia.\nThe sudden onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in the present case was caused by two mechanisms: urinary stasis and infection, which were induced by bowel obstruction.\nRegarding the treatment of hyperammonemic encephalopathy, a bladder catheter was required to prevent urinal stasis and irrigation of bladder and antibiotics and hyperammonemia-reducing drugs were administered. However, surgical treatment is ultimately required to prevent the occurrence of repeated infection and hyperammonemia.\nConcerning the surgical procedures, we could not divide the cystic bladder from rectum because of the invasive growth of the tumor. We performed surgical management only for bowel obstruction, ileal disconnection with ileocecal bypass, and sigmoidostomy. Therefore, the serum ammonia value was kept slightly high around 80~120 \u03bcg/dl after surgery, and bladder catheter was needed during the post operative period. Consequently, these comprehensive treatments were considered to be effective to prevent the repeated hyperammonemic encephalopathy. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 60-year-old female with 2 years history of hypothyroidism presented to our emergency department with the complaints of dry cough and fever for 3 days and severe weakness of all limbs for 3 h before presenting to the hospital. The history of presenting complaints revealed that for last 7-8 months she had experienced occasional brief episodes of limb weakness, which tends to occur at rest following exertion. For the last 3 days, the patient experienced increasing episodes of weakness and along with her meals she had also consumed approximately 200 ml coconut water per day. There was no history of recent animal bite, illicit drug or alcohol abuse. She had no past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, and chronic kidney disease. Her current medications included tablet thyroxine 100 mcg before breakfast.\nOn presentation, she was afebrile. Her heart rate was 80/min, respiratory rate was 20/min, systolic blood pressure was 86 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Physical examination revealed hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases and the knuckles and patchy hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa [Figures and ]. Neurological examination revealed fully intact mental status, 1/5 power in both upper and lower extremities on the medical Research Council scale and diminished deep tendon reflexes in all extremities. Superficial, deep, and cortical sensations were intact and cranial nerves; fundoscopy was normal. Examination of abdomen, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems were unremarkable.\nThe initial laboratory tests showed serum sodium of 123 mmol/L, serum potassium 10.4 mmol/L, serum chloride 103 mmol/L, serum creatinine 0.89 mg/dL, and random blood sugar 99 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis with high anion gap: pH 7.29, PCO224, PO282, HCO312, anion gap 20. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tall and peaked T-waves. Transtubular potassium gradient value was 5.1. Other hematological and biochemical tests, including complete blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urine analysis, serum calcium, serum magnesium, creatine phosphokinase, thyroid and liver function tests were all within the normal limits. Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus serology was negative. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound examination did not reveal any abnormality.\nHypotension, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia suggested adrenal crisis due to acute stress in long standing primary adrenal insufficiency. She was treated with normal saline, antibiotics, 10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate intravenously, 10 mg of nebulized salbutamol, slow intravenous injection of 10 units of regular insulin added to 50 ml glucose 50% and 100 mg intravenous bolus of hydrocortisone every 6 hourly. Her limb power improved to 4/5 in few hours. After 6 h serum sodium was 126 mmol/L, potassium 7.1 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mmol/L, and ECG abnormalities resolved. Intravenous hydrocortisone was tapered over 3 days and replaced with long acting glucocorticoid prednisolone in replacement dosage. Her serial serum potassium and sodium levels after steroids replacement returned to normal level. Adrenal function test results showed: Baseline cortisol 2.87 mcg/dL (normal level 6-26 mcg/dL), increasing to 3.01 mcg/dL (normal > 20 mcg/dL) 60 min after short synacthen test. Autoantibody screening showed positive thyroid autoantibodies. Adrenal autoantibodies against adrenal cytoplasm, 21-hydroxylase, 17-alpha hydroxylase and side chain cleavage enzyme could not be done.

    "question": "An 11-year-old female patient with a prior history of cardiac arrest arrived at the emergency room (ER) 35 minutes after losing consciousness. Her mother had immediately administered basic life support. The patient was born in the 40th gestational week by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery and weighed 4.0 kg. There was no specific family history of syncope or sudden cardiac death. Six years ago, she experienced a brief syncopal episode. Electroencephalography (EEG) at that time showed no specific abnormality. Six months after this first event, she was admitted to the ER for sudden loss of consciousness. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was noted, and the normal sinus rhythm was restored by defibrillation. Neither delta wave nor QT interval prolongation was observed on a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) (). Echocardiography did not reveal any structural abnormalities, and Holter monitoring did not reveal specific arrhythmias. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnorzmalities. EEG was remarkable for dysrrhythmic waves and low amplitude voltage compatible with hypoxic encephalopathy. Although the definite cause of VF was not determined, it was recommended that the patient takes a beta-blocker (atenolol, 12.5 mg bid). She then underwent rehabilitation for cognitive function defects which resulted from hypoxic brain damage. She did not suffer any more attacks and stopped taking atenolol after several years.\nUpon this ER arrival, the patient was unconscious, pulseless, and without spontaneous respirations. Blood pressure was undetectable, and her body temperature was 36.5\u2103. The initial ECG showed VF. Normal sinus rhythm was restored after 2 monophasic direct current defibrillations at 200 J (). On chest X-ray, no cardiomegaly or pulmonary congestion was observed. The laboratory test results were as follows: white blood cell count, 12,400/mm3; hemoglobin, 14.5 g/dL; platelet count, 188,000/mm3; sodium, 138 mmol/L; potassium, 5.7 mmol/L; chloride, 111 mmol/L; ionized calcium, 1.42 mmol/L; ionized magnesium, 1.06 mmol/L; creatine kinase, 124 U/L; and creatine kinase-MB, 0.9 ng/mL. An arterial blood gas test revealed the following: pH 7.13; PaCO2, 55.5 mmHg; PaO2, 59.8 mmHg; HCO3, 17.7 mmol/L; and SaO2, 80.1%.\nAfter defibrillation and intubation, the patient was moved to the coronary care unit (CCU). During nasogastric tube insertion, VF redeveloped. Sinus rhythm was successfully restored by 2 defibrillations at 200 J. A review of telemetry monitoring in the CCU revealed that sinus tachycardia precipitated bidirectional ventricular tachycardia that in turn degenerated into VF ().\nThe patient was diagnosed with CPVT accompanied by typical bidirectional ventricular tachycardia which was triggered by sinus tachycardia. After intravenously administered beta-blocker (labetalol, 10 mg), tachyarrhythmia was no longer observed. After stabilization, echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 68% without any structural abnormalities. She was prescribed an oral beta-blocker (metoprolol, 100 mg bid) and discharged from hospital. She is currently being followed up. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

A computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast posttrauma was reported to have central nervous system (CNS) atherosclerosis with ventricular dilatation that was out of proportion to the degree of cortical atrophy []. A working diagnosis of NPH was made and she was scheduled to see a neurosurgeon for further management.\nOn admission, the patient had flat affect and poor cooperation. There was no papilledema.

    "question": "An 83-year-old white male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and a diabetic foot infection with osteomyelitis of his right 5th metatarsal and proximal phalanx presented with decreased appetite and nausea. Bone biopsy one month prior to admission grew Escherichia coli and the patient was initially treated with 400 mg of oral ciprofloxacin twice daily for three weeks. The patient developed gastrointestinal intolerance and was switched to oral levofloxacin, 500 mg daily, one week prior to admission, which did not improve his gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's review of systems was noncontributory aside from stated. The physical exam was notable for a positive probe-to-bone on a 1 cm-by-1 cm ulcer over the right medial malleolus and a 2 cm-by-1 cm right lateral foot ulcer along with decreased sensation over the feet bilaterally.\nLaboratory results revealed a platelet count on admission of 128.0 \u00d7 109/L (150\u2013450 \u00d7 109/L), down from a count of 480.0 \u00d7 109/L one week prior to admission (and no previous episodes of thrombocytopenia) at the visit where ciprofloxacin was changed to levofloxacin. Peripheral smear showed no schistocytes, reduced peripheral platelet count without clumping, and a single anisocyte and ovalocyte per high-power field. The white blood cell count was 5.6 \u00d7 109/L (4.5\u201311.0 \u00d7 109/L) with 81.5% neutrophils, hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (13.5\u201317.5 g/dL) with a mean corpuscular volume of 83.3 fl, and red cell distribution width of 20%. Blood chemistries showed sodium of 140 mEq/L (135\u2013145 mEq/L), potassium of 4.0 mEq/L (3.5\u20135.0 mEq/L), chloride of 106 mEq/L (95\u2013105 mEq/L), bicarbonate of 23 mEq/L (22\u201329 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen of 49 mg/dL (7\u201318 mg/dL), creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL (0.6\u20131.2 mg/dL) with baseline appearing to be 1.2 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 83 mg/dL (70\u2013115 mg/dL). Haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, vitamin B12, and folate were normal. Other than the addition of the antibiotic, there was no recent changes in his medication.\nThe differential diagnosis for the patient's thrombocytopenia consisted of dilutional effect secondary to fluid resuscitation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), myelodysplastic syndrome, splenic sequestration, and other drug-induced thrombocytopenias. During the hospital course, the hemoglobin reached a nadir of 9.5 g/d, but stabilized as the platelet count continued to trend downward ruling out dilutional effect. An absence of schistocytes on peripheral smear made intravascular consumption less likely. An ultrasound with no sign of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly decreased the likelihood of splenic sequestration. HIT was unlikely due to the fact that the patient reported no recent prior exposure to unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin, and this was confirmed by a negative HIT antibody panel. Myelodysplastic syndrome was thought to be unlikely per hematology consultants. Because of this, our concern for drug-induced thrombocytopenia increased.\nHematology consultants introduced the idea that the patient's thrombocytopenia could be a result of a drug reaction to the fluoroquinolones. The antibiotic regimen was changed from levofloxacin to cefepime on hospital day 4 and the platelets gradually rose to 127 \u00d7 109/L at discharge (). At three-week postdischarge follow-up, the patients platelets were 391 \u00d7 109/L and would remain near this level at subsequent follow-up visits. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

The patient states that she has been eating a regular diet and denied eating outside the home and did not have fever, and no one in the family had similar symptoms. Past medical history was positive for hypothyroidism and bipolar disorder and family history was negative for diabetes. One year prior to this presentation the patient had routine blood work with fasting blood glucose of 95 mg/dL. The patient reported polyuria and polydipsia for one month prior to this presentation but did not seek any medical attention.\nOn physical examination her blood pressure was 127/65 mmHg, heart rate 80 beat/min, and temperature 37\u00b0C. Her body mass index was 35 kg/m2. She was in mild distress and had no thyromegaly, clear lungs, regular heart without murmurs, soft abdomen but with generalized tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds throughout. The remainder of the physical exam was normal.\nWBC 14.8 \u00d7 109/L with neutrophils 89%, hemoglobin 18.2 g/L, and platelets 241 \u00d7 109/L. Her chemistry shows sodium 132 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 99 mmol/L, bicarbonate 12 mmol/L, BUN 5.71 mmol/L, creatinine 53.3 \u03bcmol/L, calcium 2.35 mmol/L, phosphorus 1.55 mmol/L, magnesium 1.1 mmol/L, and blood glucose 18.76 mmol/L. Arterial blood gases show PH 7.25, Pco2 3.72 kPa, and Po2 9.58 kPa on room air. Lactic acid was 1 mmol/L, amylase 1.1 \u03bckat/L, and lipase 0.27 \u03bckat/L, and serum ketones were positive. Her hemoglobin A1C was 13.7%. Urinalysis was positive for glucose and ketones.\nIt was obvious from the labs that the patient had diabetic ketoacidosis (high blood glucose, low bicarbonate, and positive ketones) with anion gap of 21. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Intravenous normal saline fluid bolus was given with maintenance intravenous fluid after that. She was kept on nothing per mouth and started on insulin drip with hourly blood glucose check and every four hours serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, and phosphorus) check.\nCT scan of the abdomen showed mild distension of the proximal small bowel and tiny amount of free fluids with wall thickening of distended small bowel loops. She was started on ampicillin/sulbactam after getting blood cultures. Stool sample was sent for analysis and the results were negative leukocytes and negative clostridium difficile toxin. Therefore, we decided to stop the antibiotics at this point and treat her as viral gastroenteritis. Later on, the patient's symptoms have improved and her anion gap closed, so we started her on liquid diet (which she was able to tolerate). She was switched to subcutaneous insulin injections (as insulin glargine at bedtime and sliding scale insulin before each meal) and transferred to medical floor. Her blood cultures did not grow any bacteria, and stool culture was negative. Insulin autoantibodies were negative, c-peptide was lower than normal (0.34 ng/mL), and her glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies were highly positive (>30 U/mL).\nAfter having diabetic education including a dietitian consult in the hospital, the patient was discharged home on subcutaneous insulin treatment with a diagnosis of latent autoimmune diabetes in adult. The patient was encouraged to do regular exercise.\nThe patient was concerned about her new diagnosis and its possible complications which required counseling about the importance of taking care of her diabetes and how this would help prevent future complications.\nThe patient was very compliant with the discharge plan and checked her blood sugar before each meal and at bedtime. She followed up in the diabetic clinic on a biweekly basis to adjust her insulin dose. Three months later her hemoglobin A1C was 7.7%. The patient has not experienced any adverse or unanticipated events. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 25-yr-old Korean man was admitted to Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, Korea, on May 26, 2011, complaining flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities and numbness of hands. On arrival at the emergency room, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, and the heart rate was 72 beats/min. He was alert with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min and a body temperature of 36.5\u2103. No heat intolerance, weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and other symptoms of hyperthyroidism were reported. On physical examination, he had a thyroid of normal size and consistency. Auscultation of the thyroid revealed no bruit. No exophthalmos or skin change was present. The lower limbs had flaccid paralysis with intact sensory function. No respiratory or visual difficulties were detected. He had no significant medical history and had received no medication; his family history was negative for familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis or thyroid disease. Laboratory tests revealed the following serum metabolite levels ; on the day of admission, sodium 143.6 mEq/L, potassium 2.42 mEq/L, chloride 104.7 mEq/L, creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, calcium 9.4 mg/dL and phosphorus 3.4 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed arterial pH 7.408 mmHg, PO2 74.8 mmHg, PCO2 35.7 mmHg and bicarbonate 23.7 mM/L. A thyroid function test showed a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.00 \u00b5IU/mL (normal: 0.3-5.0 \u00b5IU/mL), a T3 level of 205.1 ng/dL (normal: 80-170 ng/dL) and a free T4 level of 2.38 ng/dL (normal: 0.75-2.00 ng/dL). Thyroid autoantibodies showed a prominent elevated thyroglobulin antibody 93.40 U/mL (normal: 0-60 U/mL) and thyroid peroxidase antibody 642.82 U/mL (normal: 0-60 U/mL), but the level of TSH receptor antibody (by human TRAK RIA kit, BRAHMS, Hennigsdorf, Germany) was 0.37 IU/L (normal: 0-1.5 IU/L). An ultrasound revealed a normal sized thyroid gland, and neither nodules nor lymphadenopathy was detected (). A thyroid scan with Tc-99m revealed little or no uptake in the thyroid area compatible with thyroiditis (). Finally, we diagnosed this patient as thyrotoxic periodic paralysis associated with transient thyrotoxicosis due to painless thyroiditis.\nHe was given 40 mEq/L of intravenous potassium chloride in the emergency department and was then started on a normal saline infusion with 20 mEq/L of potassium chloride. He was also prescribed on an oral potassium and propranolol, which resulted in resolution of his lower extremity paralysis. On the second day of admission, his serum potassium level increased to 4.33 mEq/L. There was clinical improvement, concomitant with a progressive normalization of serum electrolytes. Complete remission of symptoms was obtained in 24 hr. Upon discharge, the patient had completely recovered his neuromuscular functions and serial measurement of his serum potassium level in the hospital remained within normal limits without oral potassium supplements.\nHe did not experience a hypokalemic paralytic attack during the subsequent 2 months. After 2 months of follow-up, thyroid function test was re-checked on outpatient department. The thyroid-stimulating hormone level was 11.11 \u00b5IU/mL (normal: 0.3-5.0 \u00b5IU/mL), a T3 level was 89.8 ng/dL (normal: 80-170 ng/dL), and a free T4 was 1.19 \u00b5g/dL (normal: 0.75-2.00 \u00b5g/dL); follow-up thyroid function survey was compatible with subclinical hypothyroidism. However, he remained symptom free. What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 3.5-year-old girl was transferred to our institution from a local hospital with abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for further investigation and management. The child was diagnosed with isovaleric acidemia in the neonatal period, because there was a positive family history of a sibling death from this inherited disorder. Hence, measurement of elevated concentrations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma by mass spectrometry [] was performed after birth; then, isovaleric acid CoA dehydrogenase deficiency was confirmed by assaying its enzymatic activity in cultured skin fibroblasts [].\nThe child was admitted to the local hospital two days ago because of new-onset upper abdominal pain. Although she was unable to describe the nature and character of the pain, it was not severe enough to require analgesics. One day prior to her admission to us, she developed vomiting that eventually became bilious.\nThe patient who had normal growth and development was on oral L-carnitine supplementation since infancy. Beside that, she was not receiving any other medications. Her family history was negative for pancreatitis. On admission to us, she was afebrile with normal vital signs. On physical examination, there was moderate upper abdominal tenderness without rebound, while she had normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Laboratory studies on admission revealed the following: leukocytes 10,110/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 14 g/dL, hematocrit 37.2%, platelets 169,000/\u03bcL, glucose 185 mg/dL (normal < 100 mg/dL), urea 26 mg/dL, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 3.6 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, AST 34 U/L, ALT 22 U/L, LDH 426 U/L (normal < 280 U/L), albumin 4.3 g/dL, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, \u03b3-GT 16 U/L, triglycerides 80 mg/dL, calcium 10 mg/dL, and amylase 536 U/L (normal 40\u2013140 U/L). Arterial blood gases showed the following: pH 7.55, pCO2 21 mmHg, pO2 133 mmHg, HCO3 23 mmol/L, and base deficit 3.8 mmol/L. The anion gap was estimated at 7. A coagulation profile and a urine analysis were normal.\nDue to the bilious nature of vomiting, an abdominal ultrasound () was obtained that showed a notably enlarged and edematous pancreas, along with the presence of peripancreatic exudates that were extending bilaterally towards the anterior paranephric spaces and towards the right colon. The wall of the duodenum was also diffusely edematous. No gallstones were seen, the bile duct was not distended, and there was no sludge in it, while the liver, spleen, and appendix were visualized without echomorphologic abnormalities.\nSince the goal of management of acute pancreatitis is to achieve analgesia, adequate rehydration, and organ rest, the child was managed with discontinuation of oral feedings, placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous hydration with 5% dextrose with electrolytes, and administration of intravenous ranitidine and of L-carnitine, 500 mg every 8 hours, that is, approximately 100 mg/kg/day.\nThe patient's clinical course was uncomplicated. Serum amylase normalized (84 U/L) on the 4th hospital day. She was fed with a low-fat and protein diet on the 6th hospital day. On the same day, the intravenous fluids were discontinued. Two follow-up ultrasonographic examinations on the 3rd and 5th () hospital days showed progressive but rapid resolution of the pancreatic edema and of the peripancreatic exudates. Due to substantial clinical improvement, with complete disappearance of the abdominal pain, the child was discharged home without any complaints on the 8th hospital day. She continued to do well, two months after hospital discharge. What is the patient's delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 66-year-old African American male with a past medical history of hypertension, alcohol use, and asthma presented with facial swelling. He was discharged two months prior for a similar event related to lisinopril. On initial presentation, the patient's vitals were significant for heart rate of 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% with a non-rebreather mask at 15 liters. Physical exam was significant for moderate to severe respiratory distress, inspiratory stridor, and subcostal and intercostal retractions. Lungs were clear to auscultation. The patient was otherwise alert and oriented. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.447, pCO2 39, pO2 197, and HCO3 27 on 60% FiO2. His initial metabolic panel was significant for sodium 104 mmol/L, potassium 2.6 mmol/L, chloride 66 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 5 mg/dL (baseline 20 mg/dL), and creatinine 0.6 mg/dL (baseline 1.0 mg/dL). Glucose was 165 mg/dL. Magnesium and phosphorus were 1.1 and 2.1 mg/dL, respectively. Serum uric acid was low at 2.7 mg/dL. Complete blood count showed no leukocytosis or anemia. Urinalysis had a specific gravity of 1.010, moderate blood, and 15-29 red blood cells. Urine electrolytes were notable for a sodium of 48 mmol/L and osmolality of 217 mOsm/kg. Serum osmolality was 215 mOsm/kg. Urine and serum toxicology were negative for any substances. Alcohol level was negative.\nDue to concern for airway protection, the patient was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. Initial chest x-ray held concern for infectious process, but antibiotics were stopped after infectious workup was negative. The patient was given two units of fresh-frozen plasma, famotidine, and Benadryl, and started on methylprednisolone 60 mg every six hours for angioedema. Lisinopril was held at this time. For his hyponatremia, the patient's labs were suspicious for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and a one-liter fluid restriction was initiated with nephrology consult. Thyroid and adrenal workup to rule out other causes of SIADH was unremarkable. A CT chest scan was done to evaluate for malignancy as a cause of SIADH, but did not demonstrate overt suspicious lung pathology (Figure ). The patient's hyponatremia appropriately corrected over the course of one week and was 130 mmol/L upon discharge. Lisinopril was discontinued and marked as an allergy for the patient. On follow-up approximately nine months later, the patient's sodium had corrected and remained within normal limits. What is the patient's delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 40-year-old (45-kg weight) previously healthy woman was admitted to the intensive burn care unit approximately 90 min after an assault chemical burn following conjugal violence. The total burned surface area was estimated at 35% (neck, face, head, arms, thorax, abdomen, and left leg), third degree []. There were severe bilateral eyes and ears lesions. Injury was due to sulfuric acid (battery acid, pH measured at 0.9). As the patient and relatives were in panic, irrigation with water was not performed at the scene of the accident but was started immediately after the arrival in the burn center. The emergency medical team began fluid resuscitation (Parkland's formula), and orotracheal intubation was performed on-site after evidence of the severity of facial burns. The patient was sedated for hospital transfer and presented the following vital signs: arterial blood pressure 70/30 mmHg, pulse 110 bpm, SpO2 >90% with normal lung auscultation.\nThe admission electrocardiogram and chest X-ray examination did not reveal significant abnormalities. Laboratory investigations mainly revealed a profound metabolic acidosis with a pH at 6.92, PaCO2 42 mmHg, total bicarbonate 8.6 mEq/l, base deficit 23.4 mEq/l, sodium 148 mEq/l, potassium 4.1 mEq/l, chloride 117 mEq/l, calcium 6.1 mg/dl, and phosphorus 15.1 mg/dl. The lactate level was within the normal range: 1.7 mmol/L. Renal function was initially preserved (serum creatinine 0.83 mg/dl), with no evidence for rhabdomyolysis. Blood coagulation tests on admission were disturbed, with fibrinogen 117 mg/dl, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 69 s, and International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.23. Platelets count was 169 000/mm3. Metabolic acidosis was progressively corrected by the administration of a total of 300 mmol of sodium bicarbonate over 14 h and of 140 mmol of lactate from Hartmann's solution over the first 24 h . The adjustment of the ventilator settings was complicated by the progressive development of a thoracic rigidity secondary to the chemical burns.\nDuring the ICU stay, the patient developed several complications. Mechanical ventilation was required for 40 days, and a percutaneous tracheostomy had been performed after 1 month. The hemodynamic condition required mild inotropic support (maximal dose of dobutamine, 5 \u03bcg/kg/min) for a period of 15 days. Echocardiography demonstrated a moderate alteration of the left ventricular function. While urine output was maintained during the first week, continuous venovenous hemofiltration had to be started after this interval and was continued for 7 weeks. The patients also developed multiple episodes of wound-related sepsis treated by adapted antimicrobial therapy. In addition, iterative surgery was required with a total of 15 procedures for excision and grafting. After 5 months, the patient left the intensive care unit for rehabilitation.

Blood tests revealed hemoglobin 17.1 g/dL (13.5\u201318), leukocytes 19.5 \u00d7 103 (4\u201310 \u00d7 103), platelets 296 \u00d7 103 (150\u2013450 \u00d7 103), glucose 248 mg/dL (60\u2013100), creatinine 0.97 mg/dL (0.67\u20131.17), sodium 136 mmol/L (135\u2013145), potassium 4.7 mmol/L (3.5\u20135.5), chloride 101 mmol/L (95\u2013112), phosphate 4.9 mg/dL (2.5\u20134.5), amylase 70 U/L (10\u2013115), lipase 28 U/L (1\u201367), pH 6.95 (7.35\u20137.45), pCO2 23 mmHg (35\u201345), HCO3 5 mmol/L (22\u201326), lactate 1.8 mmol/L (0\u20131.5), urine ketone bodies >150 mg/dL (0\u20130), CK 112 U/L (1\u2013190), CK-MB 7.3 ng/mL (0.1\u20135), and troponin I 0.07 ng/mL (0.001\u20130.05). The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block, and nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. Because of the right bundle branch block was not previously known, a new troponin test was performed six hours later with a peak value of 4.28 ng/mL. Treatment with crystalloids, continuous infusion of intravenous insulin, and administration of potassium and sodium bicarbonate were begun in the emergency room (ER). Due to a poor response over the first two hours, with the persistence of lactic acidosis, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where more aggressive rehydration with crystalloids was started, without further modifications of the original therapeutic plan.\nTwo days later, the patient was discharged from the ICU to the endocrinology ward. Because of his coronary risk factors and the elevated troponin on admission, a coronary angiography was performed, showing triple-vessel disease. Successful bypass surgery without extracorporeal circulation was performed a few days later, with internal mammary artery grafts to the anterior descendent and marginal obtuse arteries and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery. He was discharged 3 days later on Lantus\u2122 Sanofi-aventis S.p.a Valcanello,03012 Anagni (FR), Italia (insulin glargine) 20 IU and Insulina Novorapid\u2122: Novo Nordisk A/S.

The oral antidiabetic treatment with dapagliflozin was not restarted. During follow-up by endocrinology, C-peptide, anti-GAD, and IA-2 antibodies were required due to normal BMI and lack of family history suggested T1DM or a latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) rather than T2DM as etiology of his diabetes. C-peptide was 1 mg/dL (0.9\u20137.1) with glycemia 214 mg/dL (60\u2013100), anti-GAD <5 U/mL (0\u201312.5), and anti-IA-2 <7.5 U/mL (0\u20137.5). What is the patient's delta ratio?",

    "question": "An eighteen year old boy, born out of non-consangious marriage, first in birth order, born at term by vaginal delivery with normal perinatal history and normal motor and mental mile stones, was admitted in accident and emergency department with history of progressively worsening crampy leg pain from one month, increased frequency of micturation and increased thirst for last three weeks. There was history of inability to move his limbs from last 3 days. There was no history of rash, headache, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss and bladder or bowel incontinence. There was no history of any drug or herbal medicine intake. On examination, patient was conscious, cooperative and well oriented in time, place and person. General physical examination revealed pulse 92 per minute, blood pressure 110/70mmHg and respiratory rate of 16 per minute. There were bony deformities in the form of widening of bilateral wrists and bilateral knock-knees. Chest, cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Nervous system examination revealed normal higher mental functions and no cranial nerve deficit. Motor examination revealed hypotonia and a power grade of 3/5 in both arms and 2/5 in both lower limbs. Deep tendon reflexes were depressed all over and bilateral planter response was flexor. Differential diagnosis in our patient included hypokalemic periodic paralysis, myositis and renal tubular acidosis. Laboratory investigation revealed random blood glucose of 112 mg/dl, serum sodium 144 mmol/liter, serum potassium 1.3 mmol/liter, pH 7.30, serum bicarbonate 20.3 mmol/liter, serum chloride 112 mmol/liter, partial pressure oxygen 83 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 93% and partial pressure carbon dioxide 34 mmHg. Haemogram, kidney function and liver function tests at presentation are depicted in (). Muscle enzymes in the form of Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were 1823 U/liter (0-195) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 886 U/liter (100-235). In view of severe hpokalemia, patient was immediately started on intravenous potassium chloride infusion at a rate of 30 meq/hour and oral potassium was started simultaneously in a dose of 20 meq 6 hourly. There was a predictable improvement in muscle weakness after initiation of potassium therapy and patient became ambulatory after 24 hours of treatment. In view of severe hypokalemia, systemic acidosis and skeletal deformities, a strong possibility of renal tubular acidosis was made. Subsequently, patient was subjected to anthropometric examination which revealed severe disproportionate short stature () with height of 144 cm (<3rd centile, standard deviation score (SDS)=-4.30), upper segment (74 cm), lower segment (70 cm), upper segment to lower segment ratio (1.05), arm span (142 cm), head circumference (52 cm) and mid parental height of 162 cm. Patient\u00b4s weight was 33 kg with a body mass index (BMI) of 15.9 kg/m\u00b2 (<3rd centile, SDS=-2.85). Patient had well developed secondary sexual characters in the form of pubic hair stage 5, stretched penile length (SPL 10 cm), bilateral testicular volume >15ml. Hearing tests in the form of Rinne and Weber and ophthalmic tests including Schirmer\u2019s test were unrevealing. 24 hour urinary calcium was 472 mg per day, urinary creatinine 702 mg per day, urinary phosphorus 824 mg per day and urinary protein of <50mg per day and no glycosuria. After correcting hypokalemia, there was further fall in serum pH to 7.27 with serum bicarbonate of 16.5 mmol/litre. Urinary pH at this time was 7.0.Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) revealed bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis. Digital abdominal X- ray revealed fine calcified foci in bilateral renal area (). Skeletal survey revealed widening of both wrists and bilateral knock knees (). In view of severe hypokalemia and normal anion gap (12 mmol/litre) hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and inability to acidify urine with associated hypercalciurea and no apparent secondary cause, a diagnosis of primary distal renal tubular acidosis was made. However exact etiological diagnosis could not be established because of unavailibity of genetic testing in our Centre. What is the patient's delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 22-year-old Hispanic male who recently emigrated from Guatemala within the last six months, without any previous medical history presented with a chief complaint of rectal and abdominal pain. Onset of the pain was four days before; however, he had been experiencing other symptoms for approximately three months. He reported productive cough, pyrexia, chills, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. He denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, and rectal manipulation. Vital signs revealed temperature of 99.8\u00b0F, blood pressure 105/67 mmHg, pulse 91 bpm, respiratory rate 20 bpm, and oxygen saturation 99%. Labs revealed sodium 136 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, chloride 99 mEq/L, bicarbonate 22 mEq/L, creatinine 0.54, WBC 9.3 k/\u03bcl, hemoglobin 11.0 g/dl, and platelet 416 k/\u03bcl.\nOn physical examination, there was palpable right lower quadrant tenderness accompanied by abdominal rigidity and involuntary guarding. The patient was not amenable to digital rectal examination due to reported pain. However, illuminated visual examination of the rectum did not reveal any abnormalities. Due to the constellation of travel history, cough, and constitutional symptoms, a chest X-ray (CXR) was performed. It revealed biapical pleural thickening associated with parenchymal scarring, bronchiectasis, nodularity, and superimposed infiltrates (). Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was highly suspected, and the patient was placed in an isolation room. Further imaging was accomplished with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast. This revealed acute appendicitis in the right lower quadrant congruent with earlier physical examination findings (). It also revealed a 3.1 \u00d7 1.9 cm dumbbell-shaped loculated fluid collection anterior to the anus consistent with perirectal abscess () confirming the etiology of his rectal discomfort. Finally, CT gave more insight into suspected pulmonary TB as it revealed nodular and patchy consolidation in both lung bases along with dense consolidation, fluffy airspace infiltrates, distended, and distorted bronchi ().\nThe patient was taken to the operating room expeditiously where he underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), laparoscopic appendectomy, and incision and drainage of the perirectal abscess. By postoperative day one, cultures from BAL, sputum, and perirectal abscess were positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Cultures from the perirectal abscess were also positive for beta-hemolytic group C streptococcus. Gross pathology of the appendix revealed a dusky, congested, red-brown serosa. When sectioned, we appreciated a dilated lumen measuring approximately 0.5 cm in diameter and an appendiceal wall thickness averaging at 0.3 cm. The mucosa was noted to be tan-pink, glistening, and congested. The lumen of the appendix contained abundant gray-pink semisolid contents. A discrete perforation was not appreciated. Histologic analysis revealed a focally effaced mucosa albeit where present, the epithelium was without atypia. Foci of acute and granulomatous inflammation were appreciated () along with epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells (). Initial acid-fast staining was negative, but a repeat stain revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli in the cytoplasm of a multinucleated giant cell ().\nThe patient was started on antitubercular drugs that included a combination of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Based on sensitivities, he was also started on antibiotics for management of the streptococcal infection. The patient did well postoperatively and tolerated both antibacterial and antitubercular treatments without complication. What is the patient's delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 60-year-old lady, a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years and hypertension for 3 years, presented to the clinic with fever, chills, and bilateral loin pain of 4 days duration. No other co-morbidities like chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease were known in her in the past and she was apparently in normal state of health prior to the presenting illness.\nShe developed high-grade fever with chills and rigors. Fever was accompanied by dysuria and bilateral loin pain which was constant and aching in nature. Two days following the onset of fever and loin pain, she developed hematuria and subsequently her urine output started declining and she was anuric at the time of admission to the hospital. She also experienced severe generalized muscle ache. There was no arthralgia, skin rash or hemoptysis. Her medications included glipizide and multivitamin.\nAt the time of admission, she was conscious, irritable, febrile, and tachypneic. Her conjunctivae appeared suffused. There was no icterus, purpura, or lymphadenopathy. Muscle tenderness in limbs was noted. Her pulse was 104/min, BP\u2013110/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate 23/min, temperature 101\u00b0F, oxygen saturation 95% at room air. Rales were appreciated in the basal regions of the chest. Examination of abdomen revealed no organomegaly, but both renal angles were tender on palpation.\nInvestigations revealed hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL; leukocyte count of 28400 cells/\u03bcL; differential count revealed polymorphs 91%, lymphocytes 8%; platelet count 60000/\u03bcL. The blood film revealed normocytic normochromic RBCs, neutrophilic leucocytosis with toxic granulations. No hemoparasites were detectable. Urine analysis revealed 1+ protein, 40-50 WBCs/high power field, 20-25 RBCs/high power field, bile salts and pigments - negative, ketone-negative. Blood sugar on admission was 208 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen 74 mg/ dL; serum creatinine 5.4 mg/dL; serum sodium 138 mmol/L; potassium 4.8 mmol/L; bicarbonate 7.0 mmol/L; chloride 104 mmol/L; plasma anion gap +27 mmol/L, pO290 mm Hg., pCO226 mm Hg. Serum total bilirubin measured 2.1 mg/dl; SGOT \u2013 44 U/L; SGPT \u2013 34 U/L; alkaline phosphatase \u2013 242 U/L; serum total protein 6.5 g/L; and serum albumin measured 2.4 g/ dL. Urine culture revealed significant growth of E. Coli., (>105 colony forming units/ ml) sensitive to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and ceftriaxone. However, blood culture grew no organism. Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed bilaterally enlarged kidneys with hydroureteronephrosis. No radioopaque lesion could be made out in the ultrasonogram or X-ray KUB region. An MR urogram performed to further evaluate the obstruction [] revealed bilateral renal papillary necrosis (RPN) with bilateral midureteric obstruction.\nThrombocytopenia and severe myalgia prompted a search for leptospirosis, a common cause of AKI in this part of the country. The organism could not be isolated from the urine or blood. However, the MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test) done in the second week of the illness detected Leptospira icterohemorrhagica; serovar hardjo. Serologic investigations for dengue were negative.\nShe was subjected to a USG-guided renal biopsy which revealed acute tubular necrosis, interstitial inflammation, and mild mesangial proliferation [Figure \u2013].\nThe patient was treated with hemodialysis and her antibiotics included benzyl penicillin and ceftriaxone. Gradually, the fever settled, her general condition stabilized, and renal function started to improve. By the 20th day of the illness, serum creatinine was 1.7 mg/ dL and platelet count was 190,000/\u03bcL and patient was discharged. Follow-up at 3 months revealed a serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL.

    "question": "A 57-year-old Chinese male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and moderate mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral valve prolapse presented with a 3-week history of progressive hemoptysis and worsening dyspnea. The symptoms started insidiously and progressed to a point where his exercise tolerance was reduced to a few steps. He was a plumber by profession and a lifetime nonsmoker. He denied wheezing, fever, night sweats, chest pain, and weight loss. He had no history of hemoptysis or bleeding from any other body sites. He did not use any medications and denied recent travel or sick contacts. On physical examination, he appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress, tachycardia, and tachypnea. His vital signs were blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, heart rate of 116/min, respiratory rate of 34/min, temperature of 99.1 F, and saturating at 96% on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. He was oriented to time place and person and was found to be using his accessory muscles of respiration. His chest examination was notable for coarse crackles on the right side without any wheezing. His cardiac examination revealed tachycardia with a 3/6 pansystolic murmur best heard over the mitral area. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. His extremities were perfusing well and no peripheral edema was noted. His labs were notable for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (WBC: 12.7 k/mm3; neutrophils: 84%; eosinophils < 1%), his electrolytes were within normal range, and renal function was deranged with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Na: 143 mEq/L; K: 4.6 mEq/L; Cl: 107 mEq/L; HCO3: 23 mEq/L; BUN: 40 mg/dL; creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL). His liver function tests (LFTs) were notable for elevated liver enzymes (AST: 48 U/L; ALT: 127 U/L). His arterial blood gas (ABG) was notable for a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and a pO2 of 84 mmHg. His chest X-ray (CXR) showed right sided fluffy infiltrates (). He was admitted to the medical floor and started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed community acquired pneumonia. However, his respiratory status deteriorated and he was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit where he was started on noninvasive mechanical ventilation (inspiratory pressure of 15 mmHg, expiratory pressure of 8 mmHg at 100% oxygen supplementation). An ABG showed a pH of 7.13, pCO2 of 64 mmHg, and a pO2 of 68 mmHg indicative of acute respiratory acidosis. His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate and he was intubated and mechanically ventilated with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 mmHg and 50% oxygen supplementation. The patient's CXR revealed infiltrates which were more dense and confluent (). His labs were significant for up-trending leukocytosis (15 k/mm3). The patient's blood and urine cultures were negative. Tests for legionella, mycoplasma, HIV, and influenza were also negative. Autoimmune and vasculitis panels [antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody (GBM)] tests were negative. An ABG after commencing mechanical ventilation showed a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and a pO2 of 81 mmHg. Computed tomography (CT) of his chest confirmed the presence of dense infiltrates predominantly located in the right upper and middle lobes (Figures and ). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 70%, mildly dilated left atrium, significant prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/35 mmHg (systolic/diastolic/mean); pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 22 mmHg, right atrial pressure of 4 mmHg, RV: 53/6 mmHg (systolic/diastolic); cardiac Index (by thermo dilution) of 2.1 liters/min/m2, and a pulmonary artery resistance of 9 wood units. Bronchoscopy revealed fresh blood in all the lobes with no obvious source and no endobronchial lesions. Sequential lavage from the right middle lobe was not progressively bloodier and hence less consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for cytology, acid fast bacillus (AFB), fungal stain, and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Thoracentesis yielded 150 cc of serous fluid with a pH of 7.6, LDH of 80 U/L, protein of 0.9 g/dL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, cell count with a differential of 55% of neutrophils, lymphocytes of 25%, and mesothelial cells of 10%. This was consistent with a transudative pleural effusion. The cytology and culture results of the fluid from thoracentesis were also negative. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed thickening and elongation of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve consistent with myxomatous degeneration, up to 1 cm in thickness at the margin of the anterior leaflet, prolapse of posterior leaflet into left atrium, aneurysm measuring 1 \u00d7 1.6 cm2 and perforation into left atrium and severe mitral regurgitation but no vegetations. The patient continued to have increased oxygen requirements and persistent hemoptysis and eventually underwent an emergent mitral valve repair. Perioperative TEE revealed hypertrophied right and left ventricles, normal right and left ventricular function with EF of 55%, mild anteroseptal wall hypokinesis, prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet with a flail P3 segment, and severe mitral regurgitation with systolic flow reversal in right upper pulmonary vein (Figures and ). A final diagnosis of alveolar hemorrhage secondary to severe acute mitral regurgitation from myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve was made. Notably, his hemoglobin had decreased from 14.5 gm/dL to 11.7 gm/dL. Postoperative TEE did not show any evidence of mitral valve regurgitation (). A repeat bronchoscopy 3 days after the mitral valve repair showed clearing of the alveolar hemorrhage (Figures , , and ). The patient rapidly recovered thereafter as was reflected in his CXR ().

On initial evaluation in the ED, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Her physical examination was significant only for epigastric and left upper quadrant pain. Her BMI was 27.5. Initial laboratory work-up could not be accurately interpreted due to severe lipemia (); however, it revealed a serum level of lipase of 2470 U/L, amylase of 1000 U/L, blood glucose of 301 mg/dL, sodium of 117 meq/L, chloride of 92 meq/L, bicarbonate of 12 meq/L, aspartate transaminase of 60 U/L, alanine transaminase of 24 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase of 14 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 66 U/L. Arterial serum lactate was 0.78 meq/L, and urine ketone levels was valued as 4+ on urine dipstick. An ultrasound of the abdomen was performed and revealed fatty liver infiltration. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis, done 48 h later, revealed acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis with peri-pancreatic fluid. The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia associated pseudo-hyponatremia, and possible diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and started on aggressive intravenous (IV) hydration and intravenous insulin. The second day, her triglycerides dropped to 9234 mg/dL, her low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 366 mg/dL, and her high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was 40 mg/dL. Her symptoms improved progressively every day and her pain became better. The third day, triglycerides dropped to 1455 mg/dL, and after confirmation of absence of pregnancy, she was started on fibrates and statins on day 3 of admission, after which her triglyceride level continued to drop ().\nThe patient had a negative family history for dyslipidemia. No previous history of acute pancreatitis. She was maintained at home on oral metformin 850 mg daily for mild type II diabetes mellitus, estradiol 2 mg daily, progesterone 200 mg twice daily, aspirin 100 mg daily, and subcutaneous hydroxyprogesterone 500 mg daily and enoxaparin 40 mg daily as part of a regimen for IVF.

    "question": "A 38-year-old Hispanic woman with a past medical history of pulmonary embolism, DVT, and asthma was seen for an evaluation of her recurrent episodes of thrombosis. She had experienced three episodes of DVT and one episode of pulmonary embolism. The first episode of DVT occurred 5 years ago, and the second episode happened 3 years ago. The pulmonary embolism occurred 1 year ago, following her third episode of DVT. Each DVT episode presented with lower leg edema and pain, and was confirmed by lower extremity ultrasound. The pulmonary embolism episodes presented as shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation.\nShe was given the following medications to take at home: Ipratropium-Albuterol (Duoneb Neb), 3 mL by inhalation every 4 hours as needed, and warfarin sodium (Coumadin), 12 mg orally once daily. However, she was non-adherent to the use of warfarin. The notable aspects of her family history were that her mother had diabetes mellitus and hypertension, while her father had colon cancer at age of 42. She was a current smoker and had been smoking 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years. She denied alcohol and drug use. A review of systems was non-contributory.\nA recent complete blood cell count revealed the following: white blood count 11.1\u00d7109/L, hemoglobin level 14.9 g/dL, hematocrit 45.4%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 81.6 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) level 30.7 pg, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 32.8 g/dL, platelet count 555\u00d7109/L, neutrophil 46%, lymphocyte 41%, monocyte 4.6%, eosinophil 3.9%, and basophil 0.1%. A basic metabolic profile (BMP) showed the following levels: sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, chloride 109 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 29 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, glucose 86 mg/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.8 mg/dL, magnesium 2.2 mg/dL, total protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 3.7 g/dL, aspartate amino-transferase (AST) 16 U/L, alanine amino-transferase (AST) 20 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 119 U/L.\nHer latest chest computed tomography showed a small incomplete filling defect in the right upper lobe, suggesting a chronic non-occluding pulmonary embolism.

    "question": "A 69-year-old male was admitted due to quadriparesis via the emergency room (ER). He had multiple comorbidities: old pulmonary tuberculosis, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. His medications included spironolactone, glimepiride, metformin, amlodipine, and telmisartan. Two weeks earlier, however, he was diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at the outpatient department (OPD). A pulmonologist and a cardiologist prescribed oral voriconazole (200 mg twice a day) and dronedarone (400 mg twice a day), respectively. At this time, serum sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 5.5 mmol/L, and creatinine was 0.91 mg/dL. shows the chest radiographic findings.\nAt admission, the patient's blood pressure was 124/52 mmHg, and no focal neurologic deficit was noted on physical examination. Serum sodium was 133 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 9.3 mg/dL, phosphorus was 4.7 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.57 mg/dL. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation and left bundle branch block (). The severe hyperkalemia appeared to be caused by spironolactone and telmisartan coadministration, and these offending agents were discontinued. In addition, hyperkalemia was antagonized by intravenous calcium gluconate and was corrected by administration of intravenous insulin lispro and calcium polystyrene sulfonate. His proteinuria was persistent, reaching 1,131 mg/d in a 24 h urine collection. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.007, pH 5.0, albumin 1+, red blood cells 5\u20139/high power field (HPF), and white blood cells 3-4/HPF. Because monoclonal gammopathy was suggested from serum and urine protein electrophoresis, a kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopic examination revealed two global scleroses among 17 glomeruli sampled and showed marked mesangial expansion with mesangial hypercellularity and global thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. Immunofluorescence revealed lambda light chain-restricted glomerular mesangial and linear capillary loop staining (). Electron microscopic evaluation showed vague, fine granular, amorphous deposits in the mesangium and along the peripheral capillary walls. These pathologic findings were compatible with light chain deposition disease. The immunofixation test revealed that heavy and light chains were IgG and \u03bb, respectively. However, no osteolytic lesions were found, and the bone marrow was normocellular. Thus, he was discharged without specific treatment while maintaining voriconazole.\nNine days later, the patient was readmitted because of gait disturbance and dysarthria. Brain imaging revealed no acute lesion. Bradyarrhythmia was noted (), and acute hemodialysis was undertaken to treat both hypercalcemia (11.7 mg/dL) and hyperkalemia (7.5 mmol/L). Urine sodium was 127 mmol/L, potassium was 19 mmol/L, chloride was 125 mmol/L, creatinine was 36 mg/dL, and osmolality was 372 mOsm/kg H2O. The transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was calculated to be 2.02, and arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.354, pCO2 38.5 mmHg, pO2 110 mmHg, and HCO3\u2212 20.9 mmol/L. Results of the following endocrine tests were unremarkable: plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone concentration, intact-PTH, and stimulated cortisol. Vitamin D levels were low, and PTH-related peptide was undetectable. We considered the possibility of voriconazole-induced hyperkalemia; therefore, voriconazole was discontinued. Because the follow-up ECG showed the atrial fibrillation was resolved, dronedarone was discontinued. At discharge, his serum sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 4.1 mmol/L, calcium was 9.5 mg/dL, phosphorus was 3.7 mg/dL, protein was 7.5 g/dL, albumin was 3.1 g/dL, and creatinine was 0.69 mg/dL.\nApproximately one month later, the patient was readmitted because of massive hemoptysis and required bronchial artery embolization. The pulmonologist prescribed itraconazole to treat pulmonary aspergillosis. One week later, however, itraconazole was switched to a reduced dose (100 mg twice a day) of voriconazole. In the meantime, antihypertensives were switched to manidipine and propranolol.\nSixteen days after voriconazole had been resumed, serum potassium had increased to 5.7 mmol/L, and one day later, the patient again visited the ER because of chest tightness. His serum sodium was 130 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 8.9 mg/dL, phosphorus was 5.8 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.63 mg/dL. An ECG suggested complete atrioventricular block (), and he recovered normal sinus rhythm after acute hemodialysis (). Once again, voriconazole was replaced with itraconazole (200 mg once a day). Manidipine was discontinued because of the potential drug interaction between azole antifungals and calcium channel blockers. Plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone were 0.26 (normal, 0.32\u20131.84) ng/mL/h and 3.0 (normal, 4.2\u201320.9) ng/dL, respectively. No further electrolyte disturbances were noted during the admission for three weeks, and his final follow-up laboratory findings were: serum sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, calcium 9.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.85 mg/dL.

    "question": "A 78-year-old Korean male was admitted to our hospital in November for severe hypothermia. He had been diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 65 years, and had been treated with medications. He was found comatose on a mountaineering path 4 hours prior to admission. The temperature on the mountain, where he was lying, was reported to be 14\u2103. Upon admission, the patient was in deep stupor. His blood pressure, as measured in the supine position, was 80/50 mmHg, heart rate was 85 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 19 per minute. The body temperature was below 34.0\u2103 (exceeding the measurement range of 34.0\u2103 to 44.0\u2103 of the thermometer, which had an error of measurement of \u00b1 0.2\u2103). Electrocardiography showed J waves, prolonged QT, and occasional premature ventricular complexes (). Therefore, we estimated that his body temperature was indicative of moderate to severe hypothermia.\nChest radiography appeared normal, and ultrasonography of the kidneys showed normal echogenicity and intact corticomedullary differentiation without hydronephrosis. The patient's kidneys were within the normal range in size (the right kidney measured 9.3 \u00d7 5.4 cm, and the left kidney measured 9.9 \u00d7 4.6 cm). Renal scan (technetium-99m MAG3) indicated normal excretion and secretion functions. Urinalysis showed no proteinuria, and urine microscopic exam showed 10 to 19 red blood cells per high-power field with no casts. Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentrations were 25 mg/dL (normal range, 8 to 20) and 2.7 mg/dL (normal range, 0.6 to 1.2), respectively. In addition, fractional excretion of sodium was 4.5% and renal failure index was 2.25. The results of hormonal assays were as follow: plasma cortisol 14.6 \u00b5g/dL (normal range, 4.0 to 18.3), thyroid simulating hormone 1.43 \u00b5IU/mL (normal range, 0.17 to 4.05), free triiodothyronine 0.49 ng/dL (normal range, 0.78 to 1.82), and free thyroxine 1.25 ng/dL (normal range, 0.93 to 1.20). Anterior pituitary hormone levels were normal.\nThe results of arterial blood gas analysis were as follows: pH 7.260, pCO2 28.0 mmHg, pO2 151.0 mmHg, and HCO3- 12.6 mmol/L. Other laboratory studies produced the following results: serum calcium 8.8 mg/dL, serum phosphate 8.0 mg/dL, serum sodium 141 mEq/L, serum potassium 3.7 mEq/L, serum magnesium 3.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c 5.4%, lactic acid 11.4 mmol/L, serum myoglobin 1,685.0 ng/mL, serum lactate dehydrogenase 159 IU/L, serum creatine phosphokinase 68 U/L, and serum amylase 582 U/L. Urinary concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride were 95, 44.1, and 114 mEq/L, respectively. Urine osmolality was 537 mOsm/kg.\nUpon hospitalization, the patient was wrapped in a warm blanket. We provided him with a forced-air warming system (Warm Touch, Mallinckrodt Medical Inc., Dublin, Ireland) infused with warmed saline (42\u2103) by pressure infusion (Ranger, Alrizant Healthcare Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, USA). Five hours of warming resulted in an increase in body temperature to 37.3\u2103, and the patient regained consciousness. Subsequently, electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm (). After supportive care, the serum creatinine levels decreased gradually from 2.7 to 1.1 mg/dL on the fourth day of the hospital stay. The patient was discharged after 12 days of hospitalization, and the serum creatinine and body temperature were 1.2 mg/dL and 36.5\u2103 at discharge (). What is the patient's delta ratio?",

She had undergone outpatient right-sided thoracentesis on the day prior to admission, with drainage of 1500 mL of pleural fluid.\nThe recurrent pleural effusions had been occurring for three months prior to this presentation, and she had undergone thoracentesis twice for the right-sided pleural effusion and six times for the left-sided pleural effusion without any conclusive diagnosis. Results from all of thoracentesis procedures were suggestive of transudative effusions and cultures were negative.\nOn physical exam, this patient was mildly dyspneic but without retractions or accessory muscle use. There were decreased breath sounds at both lung bases. Temperature was 98.5\u00b0F, heart rate was 94/min, respiratory rate was 18/min, blood pressure was 97/55 mm Hg, and oxygen saturations were 99% on room air. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel showed WBC 8.6 thou/\u03bcL, Hb 14.1 g/dL, Hct 44.2 g/dL, Plt 356 thou/\u03bcL, sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium of 4 mmol/L, chloride of 101 mmol/L, bicarbonate 32 mmol/L, BUN 13 mg/dL, Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose 112 mg/dL. Serum immunofixation electrophoresis showed small lambda monoclonal protein and no Bence-Jones proteinuria. Chest X-ray taken at the time of admission demonstrated a moderate to large left-sided pleural effusion as well as a right lower lobe consolidation. CT scan of chest showed bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left side (). During her hospitalization, the patient underwent thoracentesis which showed WBC 484 mm3, RBC 38 mm3, lymphocyte count of 99%, monocyte count of 1%, glucose of 106 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 2.4 gm/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 80 U/L, amylase 19 U/L, cholesterol of 45 mg/dL, triglyceride 17 mg/dL, and adenosine deaminase of 2.3 U/L, and the cultures for routine, acid fast bacilli, and fungus were negative. Cytology demonstrated benign findings with numerous lymphocytes present. The patient underwent biopsy of the left upper lobe of the lung as well as chemical pleurodesis for her recurrent left-sided pleural effusion. Lung biopsy showed diffuse pulmonary amyloidosis, and Congo Red staining was positive confirming the diagnosis (Figures \n\u2013). Biopsy of the pleura was negative for any pathologic findings.\nThe patient underwent hematology/oncology evaluation. Echocardiogram showed left concentric ventricular hypertrophy. Rheumatoid factor and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. Follow-up immunoglobulin and electron microscopy as well as bone marrow biopsy were performed and favored plasma cell myeloma over primary amyloidosis. There were 6% plasma cells on aspirate smears and 15\u201320% on CD138 immunohistochemical staining of biopsy and clot sections. Flow cytometry showed 1.4% of monoclonal plasma cells typical of a plasma cell dyscrasia.\nThe patient was started on Cyclophosphamide, Dexamethasone, and Bortezomib (Velcade) therapy and was discharged in stable condition with outpatient follow-up. She had no recurrent pleural effusions at four-month follow-up. What is the patient's delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 74-year-old, avid female gardener and active smoker with a past medical history notable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension presented to the hospital with one week of progressively worsening New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III dyspnea and fatigue. She endorsed associated cough productive of yellowish mucoid sputum. She denied chest pain/discomfort, palpitations, pre-syncope, syncope, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). There was no history of fever, arthralgia, myalgia, or rashes.\nIn the emergency department, the patient was afebrile, blood pressure was 85/49 mm Hg, heart rate was 150 per minute, and respiratory rate was 22 per minute, with oxygen saturation of 94% on six liters of oxygen via a nasal cannula. The patient appeared lethargic and was using accessory muscles for respiration. General examination showed pallor. The oral mucosa was dry, with a thickly coated tongue. The neck veins were flat. Heart examination revealed a fast, irregular heart rate, variable first heart sound, and normal second heart sound without any murmurs or gallops. Lung examination revealed bilateral mid to late inspiratory crackles. The abdomen was soft, distended, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. Extremities were noted to be cold, with 1+ pitting edema and normal capillary refill time.\nRoutine laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.5 (4.0-10.5 k/uL), hemoglobin of 9.9 (12.5-16 g/dL), and hematocrit of 32.3 (37-47%). Her baseline hemoglobin concentration was around 15 g/dL. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 101.9 (78-100 fL) with elevated mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) of 34 (25-33 pg) and normal mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) of 33.4 (32-36 g/dL). Platelet count was 34 (150-450 K/uL), with elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) of 12.4 (7.4-11.4 fL). Peripheral blood smear showed intracytoplasmic parasites suspicious for Babesia along with reduced platelets (Figure ). The parasitic level was found to be at 9.04%. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 1544 U/L (125-220 U/L), haptoglobin was <6 mg/dL (27-139 mg/dL), total bilirubin was 5.4 mg/dL (0.3-1.0 mg/dL), with a direct fraction of 3.5 mg/dL (0.0-0.2 mg/dL). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 202 U/L (5-40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 90 U/L (7-52 U/L), with albumin of 2.3 g/dL (3.5-5.0 g/dL). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 51 mg/dL (7-17 mg/dL) with a normal creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, sodium 129 (135-145 mmol/L), potassium 4 (3.5-5.1 mmol/L), chloride 103 (98-107 mmol/L), serum bicarbonate 19 (24-32 mmol/L), and calcium 7 (8.4-102 mg/dL).\nThe chest X-ray was remarkable for cardiomegaly with a small right pleural effusion and small airspace opacity within the right lower lobe concerning for consolidation or segmental atelectasis. Given her presentation, she was started on intravenous fluids along with empiric antibiotic coverage for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. As the peripheral smear was remarkable for Babesia, she was started on atovaquone and doxycycline for a possible co-infection with Lyme. Blood titers for Anaplasma and Lyme were sent. Positive pressure ventilation was started to help with respiratory distress. She received intravenous fluids; however, she continued to remain hypotensive and required norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. Given the severity of her disease and parasitic load, a decision was made to do erythrocytapheresis.\nFollowing erythrocytapheresis, the parasitic load decreased to 5.54%. The patient remained in shock and clindamycin was added to the regimen. Her renal function worsened, which was believed to be secondary to pigment-induced nephropathy from hemolysis. Due to the inadequate response and development of acute kidney injury, repeat erythrocytapheresis was performed, resulting in a reduction in parasite load to 1.75%. At this point, Lyme immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunoblot was found to be positive, with negative immunoglobulin G (IgG). Anaplasma titers also showed recent/current infection, with IgG >1:1024 (reference <1:64) and IgM 1:80 (reference <1:20). Atovaquone and azithromycin were discontinued and quinine was added. Her hemodynamic status improved and she was titrated off of vasopressor support along with an improvement in respiratory status. Her complete blood count and renal and hepatic function normalized after 14 days of antimicrobial therapy. What is the patient's delta ratio?",

He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37\u00b0C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.\nCreatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000.

Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

    "question": "A 43 year-old male was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital after his workplace colleagues noted increasingly strange behavior for three days. The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient\u2019s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.\nThough initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.\nIn the ED, the patient\u2019s temperature was 103.9\u00b0F (39.9\u00b0C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.\nInitial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0\u201310.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0\u201318.0], platelet count of 135 \u00d7 103/mm3 [lab range 150\u2013350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137\u2013145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98\u2013107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0\u201330.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9\u201320], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7\u20131.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70\u201399], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0\u201310]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0\u20130.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38\u2013126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13\u201369), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15\u201346). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5\u201310 WBC, 0\u20135 red blood cells (RBC), 5\u201310 epithelial cells, 5\u201310 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40\u201370], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12\u201360], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient\u2019s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient\u2019s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 47-year-old man arrived to the emergency room due to generalized tonic-clonic seizures and altered mental status. He had a history of long-standing uncontrolled type 2 diabetes treated irregularly with insulin and metformin (HbA1c 10.1%), with no known microvascular or macrovascular complications. He had no history of alcohol consumption and twenty-four hours earlier he referred nocturia, polyuria and polydipsia. On the day of admission, while asleep, he suddenly developed three consecutive episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures along with urinary sphincter loss and subsequent postictal state.\nOn physical examination he was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, temperature 36.5\u00b0C, and room-air oxygen saturation of 98%. His body mass index was 32.2. Mucous membranes were remarkably dry. The patient was lethargic and had a Glasgow coma scale of 11/15, muscle strength was 4/5 in both lower extremities, and deep tendon reflexes were diminished. Cranial nerves were normal, sensitivity was preserved, and meningeal signs and primitive reflexes were absent. Due to the patient status cerebellum function could not be evaluated. Finger-stick glucose could not be recorded due to high blood glucose levels and venous blood gas analysis reported pH 7.36, PCO2 42 mmHg, PO2 32 mmHg, lactate 1.2 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 23.7 mEq/L. Urinary and plasma ketones were negative. Hydration with intravenous normal saline solution at 500 mL/h and an insulin infusion at 0.14 U/kg were started. Plasma glucose was 838 mg/dL (46.5 mmol/L), blood nitrogen urea 21 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL with a MDRD calculated glomerular filtration rate of 71 mL/min, serum sodium 133 mmol/L, and chlorine 89 mmol/L. Calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, hemoglobin, white blood count, and platelets were all within normal limits. Serum albumin was 2.1 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase 192 UI/L, alanine aminotransferase 19 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 21 U/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, and serum osmolality 320 mOsm/kg ().\nHead computed tomography, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray were normal. The patient after 24 hours of treatment continued with altered mental status and paraparesis progressed (3/5). Plasma glucose was lowered down carefully at a rate of 30\u201340 mg/dL/hr and was within 200\u2013300 mg/dL []. Serum osmolality dropped down to 305 mOsm/Kg (). Twenty-four hours after admission a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered and revealed increased signal intensity on T2-weighted FLAIR images with restricted diffusion in the medulla and central pons (). Mammillary bodies, thalamus, third ventricle, and both hemispheres were respected. Lumbar puncture was normal, electroencephalogram showed a nonspecific wave activity, and urinary and serum toxicology panel were negative. During all his admission serum sodium was documented to be within normal range. ODS was diagnosed and aggressive supportive therapy was started. During the next 3 weeks the patient progressively regained consciousness and muscle strength and was able to feed himself. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and MRI showed no residual damage. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 20-year-old female, unmarried, was admitted via the emergency department of our hospital on 11th December 2013 with complaints of generalized weakness since 2 weeks, difficulty in swallowing since 2 weeks, and loose stools since 5 days. The generalized weakness was gradual in onset and more marked in legs, so much so that she was unable to rise from the bed. She also felt difficulty in swallowing and in subsequent days, difficulty even voiding urine. She also complained of loose stools 4 to 5 times a day, semisolid in consistency. No mucous and no blood was noticed. However, these were associated with occasional abdominal cramps. In systemic inquiry, she did not complain of fever, sore throat, rashes, joint pain, swelling, cough, chest pain, dysuria, hematemesis or backache.\nIn the past history, she experienced similar episodes intermittently over the last five years. During these episodes, she used to develop generalized weakness, more of lower limbs, vomiting, and sometimes muscle cramps. With these complaints, she often visited doctors and also required admission in private hospitals, where she was given intravenous (IV) fluids with potassium and her weakness improved. Then she was discharged on potassium containing tablets which would relieve her symptoms. After recovery from the episodes, she used to discontinue oral potassium supplements. She used to remain well for 6 to 8 months before she developed another similar episode and treated similarly. In this way, she recalled 4 to 5 admissions. Record of some investigations seen showed that the predominant abnormality was low potassium level in the serum with normal renal functions.\nDrug history was remarkable for tablet NeoK, capsule Esomeprazole, multivitamin syrup and tablet motilium. She is the only daughter with two brothers who enjoy good health. No family history of similar disease was elicited. Parents were non-consanguineous. She studied till ninth class and then left study due to the recurrent illness. She was not addicted to narcotics. She had adequate appetite and sleep.\nOn examination, she had short stature, lean built, and looked wasted and sick. Her pulse was 88 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP), 90/60 mm Hg, temperature, 98.6\u00b0F and respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute. She was not pale looking, icteric or cyanosed. No koilonychia or clubbing was noted. Dehydration was positive, and muscles were wasted.\nHer abdomen was soft, non tender, with palpable bladder but no other visceromegaly. The chest was clear. Both heart sounds were audible in all four areas. No added sounds were noted. In central nervous system (CNS) examination, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was15/15; power was 3/5 in both lower limbs, 4/5 in upper limbs with intact sensation. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished in all 4 limbs.\nA clinical differential of malabsorption, periodic hypokalemic paralysis, or salt-losing nephropathy was contemplated.\nOn laboratory investigations, serum urea was 73 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.72 mg/dl; sodium, 127 mEq/L; potassium, 1.4 mEq/L; chloride, 101 mEq/L; and bicarbonate, 09 mEq/L. Her hemogram showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 15.1 g/dl; total leucocyte count (TLC), 37.4\u00d7109/L; and platelets, 494\u00d7109/L. Urine analysis revealed pH of 7.00; albumin, 2+; pus cells, occasional; and red blood cells (RBCs), numerous. Corrected anion gap was 22. Further biochemical tests showed serum calcium, 6.4 mg/dl; phosphorus, 3.2 mg/dl; serum albumin, 1.8 g/dl; total bilirubin, 0.86 mg/dl; direct bilirubin, 0.08 mg/dl; alkaline phosphatase, 50 IU/L; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), 14 IU/L; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), 6 IU/L; and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 7 IU/L.\nUltrasound abdomen showed both sided normal size kidneys with mild pelvicalyceal dilatation bilaterally. Bladder was distended with approximate volume of 430 ml. Chest X-ray was done, which was unremarkable (). Electrocardiography done showed flattening of T waves with occasional inversion in some leads, findings typically seen in hypokalemia ().\nShe was catheterized, rehydrated with isotonic saline with KCL, and IV antibiotics started on suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI) as TLC was high. She maintained good urinary output (>1500 ml). By admission day 5, diarrhea had settled. Repeat laboratory tests at this time showed: serum urea of 47 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.6 mg/dl; potassium, 2.5 mEq/L and sodium, 127 mEq/L.\nFurther investigations showed serum magnesium of 1.02 mg/dl. IV magnesium sulphate was administered daily with modest elevation in serum levels during subsequent days. Potassium requirement remained high and was administered by oral and IV routes. On admission day 10, her serum creatinine was 0.85 mg/dl; potassium, 2.6 mEq/L; and magnesium, 0.95 mg/dl. The temporal changes in serum magnesium and potassium are shown in . The 24-h urinary metabolic study on day 10th of admission showed potassium, 44 mmol/24h; magnesium, 50 mg/ 24 h; calcium, 108 mg/24 h (normal range: 100 to 300 mg/24 h). Fractional excretion of magnesium was 27.3%. In the face of low serum magnesium, fractional magnesium excretion should be less than 2%.\nHer gastrointestinal (GI) workup was also done including upper GI endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Upper GI endoscopy revealed normal mucosa, with mild antral erythema. Sigmoidoscopy showed normal mucosa. Tissue biopsies were also obtained. The duodenal biopsy showed mild stunting of villi with slightly increased intraepithelial lymphocytes; the antrum showed mild chronic nonspecific gastritis and the rectosigmoid, mild nonspecific colitis.\nAnti-trangultaminase antibodies and anti-deamidated gliadin-derived peptide antibodies were negative. Final diagnosis was made of GS along with changes of tropical sprue on duodenal biopsy. Genetic testing could not be done due to non-availability of the test.\nShe was discharged on third January 2014 on tablet spironolactone 25 mg, once daily, increased subsequently to 50 mg; tablet Neok, 2 tablets, 8-hourly, capsule magnesium chloride 1 capsule, 8-hourly, tablet folic acid 5 mg, once daily, tablet Ciproxin 250 mg, 12-hourly. Laboratory tests on 2-week follow up showed serum urea of 15 mg/ dl; creatinine, 0.4 mg/dl; sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.6 mEq/L; chloride, 102 mEq/L; bicarbonate, 30 mEq/L; calcium, 8.8 mg/dl; phosphorus, 3.8 mg/dl; albumin, 3.1 g/dl; and magnesium, 1.9 mg/dl. She is on regular follow-up and doing well at seven months of follow-up. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

She was 165 centimeter tall and weighed 70 kilogram. She was a housewife and mother of two living children. She smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for more than ten years. For 3 months prior to presentation, she had been taking 18-20 tablets of caffeine-based weight loss pills daily, which was higher than the recommended daily dose. Each tablet contains 60-100 mg of caffeine and she was taking 1080 mg to 2000 mg of caffeine daily. She denied the use of other medications, stimulants, herbal, alcohol and illicit drugs. She said that she had lost approximately 20-25 kilograms in last 3 months. No family history of hypertension, diabetes or coronary artery disease. She denied palpitation, chest pain, insomnia, headache, abdominal pain or increase in urination.\nOn presentation, her blood pressure was found to be 220/110 mm Hg in right arm and 230/118 mm Hg in left arm. Her initial work-up included an electrocardiogram which showed T-wave inversion in leads III, aVF and V6. A complete blood count showed hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl (normal: 12.0-16.0 g/dl), white blood cell count 15.1 k/ul (normal: 4.0-11.0 k/ul) and platelet count 231 k/ul (normal: 150-450 k/ul). Serum basic metabolic panel showed sodium 132 mmol/L (normal: 135-145 mmol/L), potassium 3.3 mmol/L (normal: 3.5-5.3 mmol/L), chloride 103 mmol/L (normal: 95/105 mmol/L), bicarbonate 23 mmol/L (normal: 22-31 mmol/L), creatinine 1.3 mg/dl (normal: 0.6-1.3 mg/dl), calcium 8.3 mg/dl (normal: 8.6-10.3 mg/dl), and anion gap 6 mmol/L (normal: 7-17 mmol/L).

Urinalysis showed only elevated specific gravity of 1.031(normal: 1.005-1.03). There were no crystals, protein and glucose in the urinalysis. Troponin I level was less than 0.030 ng/ml (normal: 0.0-0.049 ng/ml). Urine and serum toxicology screens were negative for cocaine, amphetamine, marijuana, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and phencyclidine. A chest X-ray did not show any infiltrate, consolidation, effusion or mediastinal widening. A computed tomography aortogram showed aortic dissection involving the posterior aspect of the arch extending into the common iliac arteries and right proximal external iliac artery. The dissection extended into the left subclavian and axillary arteries. There was narrowing of the origin of the right renal artery due to dissection (Stanford type B dissection) (Figure ,Figure , & Figure .)\nShe was started on intravenous esmolol and nitroprusside for blood pressure control and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. During hospitalization, her blood pressure remained well controlled with amlodipine.

    "question": "An 8-year-old Chinese boy with no specific family or psychosocial history was admitted to our hospital with an emergency occurrence of purpura, severe hematemesis, large bloody stools, and sharp abdominal pain. His symptoms had begun 2 weeks prior to admission, with abdominal pain and an erythematous pinpoint rash on his arms. The rash developed from his upper limbs (opisthenar and arms) to his lower limbs. Laboratory examination in the outpatient clinic revealed no abnormalities in indicators such as white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin. After oral medication (specific unknown), his abdominal symptoms began to reduce, as did the purpura. Ten days prior, the rash progressed mostly on the legs, and he experienced deeper abdominal pain in the form of persistent pain with abdominal gassiness and emesis. He was admitted to another hospital with a diagnosis of HSP. Seven days prior, he had melena. After fasting and fluid replacement, there was no obvious improvement in the symptoms. Half a day prior, his face and lips appeared pale, and he had increased abdominal pain, accompanied by numerous bloody stools and hematemesis. He was immediately treated with methylprednisolone, posterior pituitary injection, somatostatin, and hemocoagulase, together with the infusion of large blood products (Table ). At this stage, the patient still produced large amounts of blood in the vomit and stool. His vital signs were extremely unstable, and he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our hospital. The patient had purpura with lower limb predominance and abdominal pain (consistent with one of the following 4 criteria: abdominal pain, histopathology, arthritis or arthralgia, and renal involvement), and was diagnosed with HSP.[\nOn admission, he had severe anemia, with a blood pressure of 76/44 mm Hg, pulse of 135 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min. There was also a palpable purpura rash on both legs, tenderness in the abdomen, and absence of bowel sounds. Routine blood examination revealed a hemoglobin level of 70 g/L, white blood cell count of 11.48 \u00d7 109/L, and platelet count of 13 \u00d7 109/L. The liver function test showed albumin 10 g/L. The serum electrolytes showed sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 2.92 mmol/L, chloride 112.1 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 15.9 mmol/L (Table ) with coagulopathy. Therefore, HSP complicated with an alimentary tract hemorrhage was diagnosed. He was immediately treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg per day), infusion of blood products, and somatostatin but after 2 days after treatment (day 3), he still had massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, poor circulation, a reduced level of consciousness, and unstable vital signs. Abdominal ultrasonography and plain abdominal radiography revealed no enterobrosis. The patient was also evaluated by pediatric surgeons, and the continuation of medical treatment was suggested. However, his condition deteriorated, and he needed to rely on a life-supporting blood transfusion. He developed signs of peritonitis with abdominal distension. Gastrointestinal tract perforation was suspected. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole abdomen revealed curved liquid samples and gas shadows on the left and front of the stomach, supporting the possibility of gastrointestinal tract perforation (Fig. ). On day 4, an emergency laparotomy was performed. The surgery revealed that the anterior wall of the descending duodenum was thinner with a 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm diameter perforation, and the posterior wall had a 3 cm \u00d7 1 cm ulcer, which had penetrated into the peritoneum of the pancreas and experienced active bleeding from the broken end of the vessel. The intraoperative hemorrhage volume was approximately 3000 mL, including intragastric bleeding and intestinal blood clots. Pathological examination indicated chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall mucosa in the descending part of the stomach and duodenum, with hemorrhage, ulceration, interstitial congestion, and edema. Immunofluorescence microscopy of paraffin sections showed granular and lumpy IgA focal deposition in the blood vessel walls (Fig. ). Postoperatively, he was administered nasal continuous positive airway pressure-assisted ventilation, anti-infection treatment, albumin transfusion, platelet transfusion, abdominal drainage, methylprednisolone, fluconazole antifungal treatment, and wound dressing. The general symptoms gradually improved, vital signs were stable, and abdominal pain was relieved. The drainage tube was assessed after discharge, the abdominal CT was repeated after 1 month and the duodenostomy tube was removed 50 days after surgery. There was no evidence of rebleeding during the 2-month follow-up assessment. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "Case : A 30-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with general weakness and drowsy mental status. He had eaten only 3-4 spoons of brown rice and fresh vegetable without salt for 3 months to treat his tic disorder, and he had been in bed-ridden state. He had taken propolis and enema by himself, and his past medical history was unremarkable except tic disorder since high school. His blood pressure was 100/70 mm Hg, pulse rate 72/min, and respiratory rate 18/min, body temperature 36\u2103. He had lost 14 kg in the past 3 months. Physical examination presented cracking over his skin around his neck and both shoulders.\nSerum laboratory results were as follows; hemoglobin 16.2 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) 4.9 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, platelet 201 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, total protein 5.6 g/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 114 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 101 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 57 IU/L, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 13 IU/L, bilirubin (total/direct) 3.22/0.8 mg/dL, glucose 166 mg/dL, amylase 98 IU/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 33.6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.41 mg/dL, total CO2 20.2 mEq/L, sodium 101 mEq/L, potassium 4.0 mEq/L, chloride 68 mEq/L, calcium 6.8 mg/dL, inorganic phosphorus 2.7 mg/dL, magnesium 1.5 mEq/L, uric acid 1.0 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.87 mg/dL, osmolality 213 mOsm/kg H2O, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 1,472 IU/L (29-145), myoglobin 1,278 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1,472 IU/L (0-500), total cholesterol 231 mg/dL, triglyceride 97 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol 127 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol 83 mg/dL, prealbumin 10.7 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c 5.4%, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 1.26 uIU/mL, free T4 0.75 ng/dL, and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.61. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.012, pH 7.0, trace protein, glucose 2+, occult blood 3+, myoglobin 2,687 ng/m, urine sodium 62 mEq/L, potassium 34.4 mEq/L, chloride 43.1 mEq/L, and osmolality 484 mOsm/kg H2O.\nChest AP X-ray showed mediastinal emphysema and extensive soft tissue emphysema in his neck and chest wall. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a small amount of ascites and small amount of fluid collection in his bilateral perinephric space. Chest CT showed extensive soft tissue emphysema in his neck and chest wall, extensive mediastinal emphysema, small right pneumothorax, and pericardial fluid (). To rule out esophageal perforation esophagography with gastrographin was performed and it showed no evidence of contrast leakage from his esophagus. The diagnosis of orthorexia nervosa with hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and soft tissue emphysema was made. We started on intravenous fluid supplementation based on treatment of hyponatremia and refeeding syndrome, and oral feeding. He gradually improved, but his total protein and albumin decreased on the 5th hospital day to 4.4 g/dL and 2.5 g/dL, respectively. On the 7th hospital day, his platelet and WBC levels decreased to 27 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L and 1.2 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, respectively. On the 12th hospital day his hemoglobin level decreased to 7.2 g/dL from his hospital 2nd day. Peripheral blood smear showed normochromic normocytic anemia with anisopoikilocytosis 2+, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, relative monocytosis 14%, and thrombocytopenia. His iron level was 88 \u00b5g/dL, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) 168 \u00b5g/dL, ferritin 908.6 ng/mL, vitamin B12 988 pg/mL, folate 2.8 ng/mL, and his Coomb's test, plasma hemoglobin, haptoglobin, and serology were within normal limits. We transfused 6 units of platelet concentrate by his hospital 7th day and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 150 \u00b5g due to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 560 and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia by his hospital 16th day.

    "question": "A 69 year old Hispanic female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post revascularization, ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease had presented to our hospital for further evaluation and care. For the past few months the patient had suffered weight loss (approximately 30\u201335 lb), generalized malaise, low grade fevers (99.9 F), non-productive cough, myalgias and arthralgias. She did not endorse any night sweats or recent travel history, and there were no sick contacts at home. Prior to admission to our institution the patient was at an outside hospital and was being treated for sepsis with combinations of antibiotics including intravenous vancomycin, meropenem, echinocandin, metronidazole, and piperacillin tazobactam for 2 to 3 weeks duration as she was developing fevers and productive cough.\nThe physical exam yielded a thin and chronically ill appearing female patient.\nVital signs at the time of admission were notable for hypertension (186/79 mmHg). Her eyes did not show any conjunctival hemorrhaging or icterus, however there was conjunctival pallor. Oropharynx did not show any active exudates or ulcerative lesions. Her cardiac exam did not reveal any murmurs and her airways were clear to auscultation. Abdominal exam revealed palpable splenomegaly. Examination of the extremities did not show nail deformities including splinter hemorrhages or nail pitting. Her skin had no evidence of skin nodularities or other lesions. There was a 1 cm non tender, movable left axillary lymph node. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nInitial laboratory work revealed that the patient had pancytopenia. White blood cell count (WBC) was stated at 2.4 K/uL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.92 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 11.6, and platelet count of 39,000/uL. B2-microglobulin was seen elevated at 9.2 mg/L. Basic metabolic panel obtained showed sodium 134 mEq/L, Potassium 3.5 mEq/L, Chloride 103 mEq/L, Bicarbonate 26 mEq/L, Blood urea nitrogen 30 mg/dl, Creatinine 0.90 mg/dl, glucose 220 mg/dl. Liver function panel showed Albumin 2.2 g/dl, normal transaminases, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl. Urine analysis showed 200 mg/dl of protein and occasional amorphous crystals.\nInitial computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis during hospital admission showed a 15 cm spleen which was heterogenous and micronodular, as well as scattered abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy (Fig. ). No imaging signs of portal hypertension were noted.\nDuring the hospitalization our patient was noted to become more confused and agitated, and there was concern that the patient was having seizures as she was seen numerous times to lose consciousness and awaken, with occasional loss of bladder function. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed subcortical non enhancing FLAIR hyper intense foci in the bilateral posterior occipital lobes.\nLumbar puncture and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) studies were further performed for further analysis, and showed: WBC 1; no red blood cells; protein 62 mg/dL; glucose 35 mg/dL; and, lactate dehydrogenase 234 mIU/mL. Most notable negative findings in the CSF included no detectable viral cultures for cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, herpes virus, and varicella zoster virus, negative cryptococcal antigen serology and negative bacterial and fungal cultures.\nElectroencephalogram studies showed triphasic morphology waves with and without sharp negative component at 2\u20133 hertz. These were seen in continuum mostly with subtle waxing and waning features. To 0.5 mg intravenous alprazolam, above discharges had slowly resolved, replaced by organized background that consists of 6 hertz rhythms. Importantly, there was a clinical improvement after alprazolam; suggesting a nonconvulsive seizures responding to benzodiazepine.\nTwo weeks later after the initial CT imaging and after the patient was more stable from the neurological perspective in order to attempt a lymph node excisional biopsy, a PET-CT imaging was performed and showed complete resolution of the previously detected lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. (Fig. ).\nAdditional serologies for viral hepatitis and autoimmune etiology work up were performed. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and additional serum erythropoietin level, iron profile; cobalamin and folate level were determined.\nThe patient returned to the benign hematology clinic after discharged from the hospital. During her follow up appointment she appeared in better spirits and recovering well. Physical examination was notable for an absence of lymphadenopathy particularly in the cervical and axillary region, as well as no palpable organomegaly in the abdomen. It was further revealed that her antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer was highly positive (1:640), ESR 108 mm/hr with a CRP 6.74 mg/L. Negative viral hepatitis B, C and Human Immunodeficiency virus serologies.\nSerum quantitative immunoglobulin showed a mildly elevated Ig A and Ig G level, without other abnormalities. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis did not reveal a monoclonal gammopathy. Serum free light chain levels showed kappa 96.3 mg/L and lambda 60.06 mg/dL with a normal ratio 1.6 in a patient with chronic kidney disease.\nComplement C3 level was normal with a slightly elevated C4 at 46 mg/dL.\nBone marrow aspirate yielded a predominance of CD3 positive polytypical small T cells and a population of polyclonal B-cells by flow cytometry and negative for lymphoma or other malignant process. A focal lymphohistiocytic aggregate with granuloma formation was noted; occasional larger cells with prominent nucleolus identified; eosinophils were increased mildly in the vicinity of this aggregate. Acid fast bacilli and fungal stains were attempted; however the focal granuloma could not be appreciated at subsequent sections.\nThe patient\u2019s pancytopenia was thought to be likely secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and she was thus referred to rheumatology for further work up, and further testing included anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-RNP, anti-CCP antibody, ANCA vasculitis panel, direct antiglobulin test, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and anti-SSA and anti-SSB. All these tests were negative, thus ruling out systemic erythematous lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other connective tissue disorders.\nThe interval improvement and self-limited clinical course in our case led us to believe that her elevated ANA titers, her bone marrow granuloma were secondary to an EBV infection-related syndrome. Monospot test was not performed and at that point we evaluated for EBV PCR and EBER staining in the bone marrow. Initial EBV PCR results were positive (960 copies/mL), while Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs staining in the bone marrow was negative. Our in situ hybridization stain is validated to work on decalcified bone marrow trephine biopsies and all stains include an on-slide positive control. As such, the likelihood of a false negative result is low. A possible explanation includes a sampling factor with lack of infected B-cells in the bone marrow despite the presence of viremia.\nHer follow up labs during subsequent clinic visits showed WBC 5.3 K/uL, ANC 3.15 K/uL, Hgb 7.4 g/dL, calculated reticulocyte index of 1.1 and platelets 172 K/uL. Iron was 68 ug/dL, transferrin 124.1 mg/dL, ferritin 2952 ng/mL and serum erythropoietin levels were 31.7 mIU/mL. Serum cobalamin was 394 pg/mL and serum folate 12.3 ng/mL. Since there was spontaneous interval resolution of her neutropenia and her thrombocytopenia our diagnosis at that point was cytopenias secondary to infectious mononucleosis and anemia of chronic kidney disease related to diabetes.\nOur patient presented 7 weeks later at the emergency room with a recurrent febrile syndrome with diffuse cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly (Fig. ) and worsening cytopenias: WBC 1800/uL, ANC 1480/uL, Hgb 8.3 gr/dL, platelet count 20,000/uL; a repeat EBV titer revealed 6580 copies/mL. CT imaging with contrast found bilateral axillary, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Low volume retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly with numerous small ill-defined hypodense lesions was in the spleen and probably also within the liver (Fig. ). At this time a repeat bone marrow biopsy and an excisional lymph node biopsy were performed and reviewed. The bone marrow specimen showed a solitary large cell positive for CD30 identified in the clot. No atypical cells are identified in core biopsy as assessed by IHC for CD30 and Pax-5. EBER was positive in few and scattered cells. The lymph node sections demonstrated near-total effacement of the lymph node architecture by a neoplasm comprised of neoplastic cells with Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg morphology. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD15, CD30, PAX5 (weak), and MUM1. They were negative for CD3, CD20, CD45, ALK, and EMA. The findings were diagnostic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, best subtyped as lymphocyte-depleted. (Fig. ). The expression of PAX5 with weak intensity coupled with MUM1 expression by the neoplastic cells is diagnostic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The expression of PAX5, a gene encoding a B-cell-specific transcription factor, excluded T-cell lymphoma as a diagnostic consideration. It is worth noting also that flow cytometry done on a bone marrow sample with involvement by lymphoma showed no evidence of T-cell or B-cell immunophenotypic aberrancies.\nThe patient was started on ABVD chemotherapy regime, bleomycin was held secondary to patient\u2019s history of cardiomyopathy. She received three cycles of chemotherapy with complete clinical remission. Additional cycles of chemotherapy were not completed given prolonged and severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenias that eventually recovered over the following months. A bone marrow biopsy at completion of treatment revealed no morphologic evidence of residual Hodgkin lymphoma. Her most recent surveillance PET-CT imaging, nine months from completion of treatment, showed no hypermetabolic lymphoma and continuing complete metabolic response to therapy.

    "question": "A 55 year old post menopausal Caucasian female presented with vitiligo on her face, arms and legs. Her past medical history included only mild asthma requiring only intermittent bronchodilators without glucocorticoids. There was no other significant personal or family medical history. Clinical examination showed a well woman, weight of 69.1 kg, height 1.67 metre (body mass index ~25). Her blood pressure was 120/75 lying and 120/70 sitting with a regular pulse of 78 beats per minute. There were 3 vitiligo patches each measuring approximately 3 \u00d7 5 cm on her forehead, anterior abdomen and left cubital fossa. No goitre or liver enlargement was detected. Biochemical investigations are as follow: sodium 130 mmol/L (reference range (RR), 136\u2013146), potassium 5.4 mmol/L (RR, 3.5\u20135.5), chloride 99 mmol/L (RR, 98\u2013108), bicarbonate 21 mmol/L (RR, 24\u201330), urea 9.1 mmol/L (3.0\u20137.0), creatinine 90 umol/L (RR, 40\u201390), bilirubin 18 \u03bcmol/L (6\u201310), alanine aminotransferase 105 IU/L (RR, < 50), aspartate aminotransferase 56 IU/L (RR, < 45), alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L (RR, < 110), \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 40 IU/L (< 60), albumin 33 g/L (RR, 35\u201345), plasma aldosterone 172 pmol/L (RR, 80\u20131040), plasma renin activity > 35.7 ng/mL/hr (RR, 1.2\u20132.8). In essence, they showed mild hyperkalaemic metabolic acidosis and hepatocellular dysfunction. Because the latter persisted, chronic hepatitis C was confirmed with positive serology of genotype 1. The liver biopsy showed changes consistent with chronic persistent hepatitis, the inflammatory and fibrotic changes were both graded 1 according to the scoring method []. Together with additional biochemical and immunological studies, other causes of persistent abnormal liver function tests were excluded. In view of her vitiligo, hepatitis C and biochemical disturbance, the Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test (AST), also known as the Cosyntropin or Short Synacthen test, was performed which revealed the presence of subclinical adrenal insufficiency (AI), additional file . Further investigations for the causes of AI revealed positive adrenal cell antibody (ACA) serology. Computerised tomographic scan showed small adrenal glands bilaterally with normal anatomy and appearance.\nThe patient underwent routine combination treatment of Interferon-\u03b12\u03b2 (IFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) for 48 weeks for her genotype 1 HCV infection. The patient's subclinical adrenal disease was also followed closely using salivary as well as serum cortisol levels to assess the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) every 12 weeks, starting at baseline, during treatment, 6 and 12 month follow-ups. The results suggested a progressive decline of her adrenal function during the treatment phase. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy was seriously considered but with apprehension due to possible exacerbation of the hepatitis. The risks were discussed in detail with the patient and her family and it was decided to continue with anti-viral therapy but without glucocorticoid supplement. The patient and her husband were counselled comprehensively regarding the emergency management of Addisonian crisis, provided with a carrying note and required to wear an alert bracelet. Other immediate family members were also involved in her management plan, with her consent. Her management plan was also forwarded to the local hospital Emergency Department and Hepatitis C Service. Fortunately, there was no crisis other than the common side effects of the treatment regimen. Her pattern of steroid profile and ACA returned to its pre-existing state and remained unchanged at 6 and 12 month follow-up after the cessation of therapy. The patient has remained well since but her subclinical AI persists. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 52-year-old white male with O2-dependent COPD, hypertension, GERD, idiopathic gastroparesis, and chronic low back pain was noted to have persistent hypokalemia in the 2.7\u20133.3 meq/L range over more than 2 years. He complained also of chronic generalized weakness and fatigue. He denied nausea or vomiting, but did have occasional loose stools. The hypokalemia persisted despite discontinuation of diuretic treatment for hypertension and fludrocortisone that had been prescribed briefly for orthostatic hypotension. There was no improvement with aggressive oral potassium supplementation in amounts up to 120 meq per day. The patient's serum potassium level normalized on three occasions when he was hospitalized and given supplemental potassium (COPD exacerbations in 7/06 and 1/07, pseudoseizures in 7/07), but the hypokalemia promptly recurred after discharge from the hospital (Figure ). His medications were paroxetine, trazodone, pregabalin, sustained-release morphine, loratadine, isosorbide mononitrate, lisinopril, metoprolol, simvastatin, omeprazole, metoclopramide, potassium chloride, calcium/vitamin D tablets, alendronate, and mometasone, tiotropium, and albuterol inhalers. He smoked one-half pack of cigarettes per day and did not drink alcohol.\nOn physical examination, he was a chronically ill-appearing man wearing a nasal cannula. Height was 69 inches, weight 205 pounds. There were no cushingoid facies, buffalo hump, or abdominal striae. Vital signs were temperature 98.6 degrees, pulse 95, respiratory rate 14, blood pressure 128/73. There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. Lungs showed decreased breath sounds and mild expiratory wheezes bilaterally. Heart sounds were regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, with no masses or organomegaly. Extremities showed no edema, clubbing or cyanosis. The neurologic examination revealed mild generalized muscular weakness (4+/5) and normal deep tendon reflexes.\nLaboratory results include serum sodium 137 mg/dL, potassium 3.0 mg/dL, chloride 95 mmol/L, CO2 30.0 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 5 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, calcium 9.3 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.1 mg/dL, albumin 3.6 g/dL, ferritin 126 ng/mL, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, white blood cell count 10.6 K/cmm, and platelet count 160 K/cmm. Serum aldosterone was 4.8 ng/dL (normal 4\u201331 ng/dL) and the plasma renin activity was 0.33 ng/mL/hr (normal 1.31\u20133.96 ng/mL/hr upright, 0.15\u20132.33 ng/mL/hr supine). Spot urine potassium was 8.6 mEq/L, urine sodium was < 10 mEq/L, and urine chloride was 16 mmol/L.\nIn the absence of a clear explanation for this patient's chronic hypokalemia, he was asked to give the details of his diet. He admitted to drinking 4 liters of Pepsi-Cola per day for the past several years. It was his habit to sip cola slowly but almost continuously, throughout the day. When hospitalized, he had stopped drinking cola and his potassium levels had temporarily normalized. In early May 2008, he decreased his cola intake to 2 liters per day, with a resultant increase in the serum potassium from 3.0 to 3.5 mg/dL (Figure ).

    "question": "A 32-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of marked edema of 5 days' duration. Past medical history included: Bipolar disorder, panic disorder, hypothyroidism, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Her daily home medications included lithium carbonate 900 mg, synthroid 75 \u03bcg, cymbalata 60 mg, nortryptiline 30 mg, cipralex 30 mg, gabapentin 600-900 mg, and ibuprofen 200 mg. The patient had been on a stable dose of lithium for approximately 5 years experiencing no side effects. She presented to the hospital with a 5-day history of severe fatigue, migraine-like headaches, lethargy, and significant anasarca. Associated with these symptoms were upper extremity tremors as well as polyuria and polydipsia. She denied chest pain, shortness of breath, constitutional symptoms, and any urinary symptoms. Social history included 10-pack year history of tobacco.\nOn admission, the patient's vital signs were: Blood pressure 115/61, heart rate 61 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. The patient was afebrile. There was generalized + 2 edema of lower extremities, upper extremities, and periorbital regions. Minimal bibasilar crackles were appreciated. The remainder of the cardiovascular and abdominal examination was unremarkable.\nBlood work showed a plasma creatinine level of 119 \u03bcmol/L (baseline 69 \u03bcmol/L) and a blood urea of 10.4 mmol/L. Urine dipstick showed a specific gravity of 1.016, pH 7.5, and 4 + protein; and was negative for glucose, ketones, and nitrites. Microscopy revealed oval fat bodies and free fat droplets. The urine albumin to creatinine ratio was 973.4 mg/mmol and 24-h urine protein was 15.69 g. On admission, serum lithium level was 2.66 mmol/L (therapeutic 0.50-1.50 mmol/L). Serum sodium was 130 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 27 mmol/L. A complete blood count demonstrated hemoglobin 106 g/L, white blood cell count 9.46 \u00d7 109 /L, and platelet count 234 \u00d7 109 /L. Serum albumin was low at 20 g/L; but all liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and coagulation studies were within normal limits. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was 18.90 mU/L and free T4 8.2 pmol/L. Serology for hepatitis B and C, anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, ribonucleoprotein, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, inflammatory myositis, and Smith antibody were all negative. Antinuclear antibody was slightly positive on admission. Chest radiographs revealed nonspecific bibasilar infiltrates. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated normal kidneys with no renal calculi or hydronephrosis.\nLithium treatment was discontinued immediately and the patient was treated conservatively with fluids. Initially the patient refused renal biopsy. Once stabilized, she was discharged from the hospital and lithium remained discontinued. At 2 months follow-up, the patient experienced worsening anasarca, significant acute kidney injury (AKI; serum creatinine 209 \u03bcmol/L), and persistent proteinuria. She was readmitted to the hospital and subsequently underwent a renal biopsy, when at the time her creatinine peaked at 348 \u03bcmol/l. On light microscopy, there was no global sclerosis, crescent formation, or necrotic lesions capillary wall thickness was normal. There was evidence of moderate focal interstitial fibrosis []. Immunofluorescence did not demonstrate any immune deposits. Electron microscopy revealed widespread fusion of podocyte foot processes affecting more than 75% of the surface of glomerular capillary loops []. No electron dense deposits were evident. A diagnosis of MCD secondary to lithium use was established and the patient was started on high dose corticosteroids, initially intravenously, but changed to oral prednisone 80 mg daily on discharge. Over the next 2 months of follow-up, the patient's creatinine, proteinuria, and edema all decreased significantly and she was tapered to oral prednisone 40 mg. At her 4 months follow-up, her albumin/creatinine ratio had decreased to 220 mg/mmol and she remained on oral prednisone 40 mg daily. Her edema as well as AKI had resolved.

    "question": "A previously healthy 23-month-old boy presented to our hospital with a 2-day history of fever, postprandial diffuse abdominal pain, and non-bilious vomiting (>5 episodes/day) that began 1 day before admission. After admission, the patient developed a watery diarrhea. In addition to food refusal, he was observed to produce lesser urine than usual upon void review. His medical and birth history were unremarkable (he was not administered any medications, he had no known allergies, and his immunizations were up to date). His family medical history was unremarkable, and he had no travel history at that time.\nUpon examination, the patient looked acutely ill and dehydrated. He was 90.2 cm (in the 75\u201385th percentile) tall and weighed 11.6 kg (in the 15\u201325th percentile). His abdomen was soft and flat with normoactive bowel sounds. Upon palpation of the abdomen the examination revealed the existence of a mild tenderness over the entire abdomen, without rebound tenderness or muscle guarding or rigidity. The rest of his physical examination was noted to be normal. The patient's vital signs showed a heart rate of 141 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 with a normal respiratory pattern, temperature of 38.6\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 98% on room air. He was observed to be mentally alert at the time of the examination. The initial laboratory tests revealed the following: white blood cells (WBCs) 6,500 cells/\u03bcL, hemoglobin (Hb) 13.2 g/dL, platelets 423,000/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 6.35 mg/dL, sodium 130 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, chloride 90 mmol/L, and total carbon dioxide 14.4 mmol/L. All other blood tests were within the reference range. His stool occult blood test was positive (748 ng/mL). It is noted that the tests for rotavirus and norovirus antigen were negative. An erect chest X-ray did not show pneumoperitoneum; however, an erect abdominal X-ray demonstrated abnormal dilatation of the small bowel loops with air-fluid levels suggestive of possible SBO (). The abdominal ultrasonography revealed mild wall thickening of the small bowel loops suggestive of acute enteritis, several enlarged lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant, and a normal-appearing proximal appendix (the tip of the appendix was not visualized), without any evidence of mechanical bowel obstruction such as an intussusception.\nThe patient was resuscitated using normal saline and received conservative management. At that time, cefotaxime was empirically administered intravenously. The following day, his condition rapidly deteriorated, and he developed a state of septic shock. Upon examination, the patient's vital signs now were: blood pressure (BP) 87/39 mmHg, heart rate 170 bpm, respiratory rate 56, temperature 38.1\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation 93% on room air. Our surgical team urgently came to the patient and performed physical examination; his abdomen was soft with mild tenderness and slight muscle guarding on palpation. They recommended continuing medical supportive care, but frequent physical examinations needed to be performed to detect subtle changes in the patient's signs and symptoms. The patient's laboratory tests were repeated and revealed: WBCs 5,300 cells/\u03bcL, Hb 9.7 g/dL, platelets 186,000/\u03bcL, CRP 28.96 mg/dL, sodium 129 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 95 mmol/L, and albumin 2.6 g/dL. Upon review, the coagulation tests revealed an abnormally prolonged prothrombin time at 21.5 seconds and an activated partial thromboplastin time at 56 seconds. The patient's venous blood gas analysis demonstrated metabolic acidosis: pH 7.28 and bicarbonate 15 mmol/L. Upon review, other blood tests remained within reference range. A plain abdominal X-ray was repeated and showed worsening of small bowel ileus. At that time, an urgent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT was performed in order to confirm the presence of a surgical abdomen. The imaging revealed diffuse dilatation of the large and small bowel loops (suggestive of paralytic ileus) with uniform enhancement of bowel wall and no lead point of bowel obstruction, mesenteric lymphadenitis, and mild ascites (). However, the radiologists were of the view that obstructive ileus could not be completely ruled out in this case. They did not find an abnormal appendix, but the condition of an acute appendicitis could not be excluded either. The patient was maintained on a nil per os status, and fluid resuscitation was continued. We tried rectal tube decompression, however, his condition did not show much improvement except the passage of small amount of rectal gas. He received albumin, packed red blood cells, and fresh frozen plasma intravenously. At that time, Metronidazole was additionally administered empirically, and his vital signs were closely monitored for any significant changes.\nOn the third hospital day, the patient became more lethargic despite medical therapy. His BP was observed to have normalized; however, it was noted that tachycardia and tachypnea persisted. On repeated physical examination, his abdomen now showed distention with hypoactive bowel sounds, however, muscle guarding or tenderness could not be clearly ascertained on palpation. The patient developed generalized edema and oliguria. Based on the patient's clinical condition, we decided to perform an urgent exploratory laparotomy at 44 hours after admission.\nUpon opening the peritoneum, approximately 400 mL of ascitic fluid was drained. Next, a segment of markedly dilated and infarcted small bowel was identified 30 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve (). It is noted that the total length of the necrotic small bowel was approximately 60 cm. The omentum and the colon appeared to be intact. Upon review, the small bowel intussusception or volvulus was not identified. Even at laparotomy, our surgical team could not find the lead point of bowel obstruction. The appendix appeared unremarkable macroscopically. In this case, after decompression of the bowel following an incision on an infarcted small bowel segment, 110 cm of the distal small bowel containing the necrotic segment was resected and end-to-end small bowel anastomosis was performed in addition to a prophylactic appendectomy.\nHistopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed multiple areas of mucosal necrosis with diffuse congestion. The patient blood cultures did not reveal any bacteria, and stool cultures did not reveal Salmonella or Shigella. His postoperative course was considered to be uneventful, and oral nutrition could be initiated on postoperative day 5. The patient was discharged in a good general condition on postoperative day 11. After discharge, the patient was noted as asymptomatic and did not report any serious residual complications. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old man with no medical history presented with headache since the morning and increasing nausea and drowsiness during the day. He became progressively confused in the late afternoon after which his partner consulted a doctor. On arrival at the emergency department he had an epileptic seizure with spontaneous recovery. Neurological and physical examination were unremarkable. Clinically he was euvolemic. CT head showed diffuse sulcal effacement without signs of haemorrhage, basilar artery thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or an intracranial tumour. Venous blood gas analysis, taken minutes after the seizure, showed a pH of 6.89, Pco2 10.8 kPa, bicarbonate 15.4 mmol/L, base excess \u221219.4 mmol/L and a lactate of 18.0 mmol/L. Blood chemistry was remarkable for sodium 131 mmol/L, chloride 82 mmol/L, albumin 51 g/L and an osmolality of 278 mOsmol/kg. The urine toxicology test was positive for acetaminophen but negative for opiates, amphetamines and cocaine. He was then treated with ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, acyclovir and dexamethasone awaiting the results of the lumbar puncture but the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was normal.\nThis prompted us to reconsider the laboratory results. Patients relatively high haematocrit (0.48 L/L), together with the increased albumin level, were suggestive for haemoconcentration. However, we realised that measurements were done in a venous blood sample, which may have been \u2018haemoconcentrated\u2019 by water influx into the muscles during rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, we suggested that his arterial sodium concentration could well be lower, possibly low enough to explain the seizure. And indeed, in an arterial blood gas analysis taken 45 min after the seizure, the plasma sodium level was 118 mmol/L. Analysis of this hyponatremia revealed a urine sodium level of <20 mmol/L and an osmolality of 92 mOsmol/kg. He was diagnosed with primary polydipsia (the polyuria explaining the relatively low urine sodium concentration) and was admitted to the intensive care unit. In the first hours after admission his urine production was over 1 L/hour and the plasma sodium level rapidly increased to 128 mmol/L.\nAfter regaining consciousness he told he had been drinking an excessive amount of water extra throughout the day (4\u20135 L) because he thought that his headache was caused by dehydration. He further explained that he was living a healthy lifestyle in which drinking ample amounts of water played a central role. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 54-year-old female patient who had type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure and ESRD was admitted to our nephrology clinic. She had complaints of increasing shortness of breath, orthopnoea, fatigue and generalized pruritus. Her complaints also included daytime sleepiness, sudden awakening at night without witnessed apnoea. She had been on haemodialysis three times weekly for 3 years. At admission, she appeared non-distressed, blood pressure was 160/80 mmHg, heart rate was regular 78 bpm, she was afebrile and had 3/6 systolic ejection murmur on mitral region. There were diminished breath sounds at the lung bases; she had pedal oedema +/+ bilaterally. She had 5 kg above her dry weight. Thyroid gland was normally palpable. The urine output was \u223c100 ml/day.\nInitial biochemistry revealed BUN: 117 mg/dl, Cre: 5.9 mg/dl, Na: 141 mEq/l, K: 3.3 mg/dl, Cl: 83 mEq/l, albumin: 2.9 g/dl, TSH: 29.3 mU/l and free T4: 0.54 pmol/ dl. On complete blood count, haemoglobin was 9.7 g/dl, WBC 8700/mm3 and platelets 160 000/mm3. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed pH: 7.637, HCO3: 45 mmol/l, PaCO2: 43 mmHg, PaO2: 53 mmHg and oxygene saturation: 93%.\nHer medications included insulin glargine, l-thyroxine, quetiapine, sertralin, enalapril, furosemid and bisoprolol.\nThe patient had severe metabolic alkalosis. However, there were no conditions that could lead to metabolic alkalosis, i.e. vomiting, nasogastric suction or alkali administration. On further inquiry, she revealed that she had been taking baking soda occasionally for \u223c6 years in order to relieve dyspepsia. During the last month, she increased the amount of ingestion to 4\u20135 packs per day due to severe dyspeptic complaints. She underwent upper endoscopy for dyspeptic complaints a few months prior to current admission, and the procedure revealed chronic gastritis.\nWe attributed the presence of metabolic alkalosis to oral alkali intake, because she did not have sufficient renal function to excrete excess alkali load. She was not hospitalized previously for any reason at our institution, and routine ABG analysis was not done at her dialysis centre. Thus, we do not exactly know her acid\u2013base status prior to this admission. We performed haemodialysis with a haemodialysis solution whose bicarbonate concentration was 8 mEq/l below standard bicarbonate value, i.e. 26 mEq/l. We also monitored ABG values. After three consecutive haemodialysis sessions with this bicarbonate value, subsequent ABG analysis revealed pH: 7.338, HCO3: 19 mmol/l, PaCO2: 37 mmHg and PaO2: 74 mmHg. l-thyroxine dose was increased to attain euthyroid state. Her presenting symptoms were relieved at follow-up with the normalization of volume status, metabolic alkalosis and hypothyroidism. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 3.5-year-old girl was transferred to our institution from a local hospital with abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for further investigation and management. The child was diagnosed with isovaleric acidemia in the neonatal period, because there was a positive family history of a sibling death from this inherited disorder. Hence, measurement of elevated concentrations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma by mass spectrometry [] was performed after birth; then, isovaleric acid CoA dehydrogenase deficiency was confirmed by assaying its enzymatic activity in cultured skin fibroblasts [].\nThe child was admitted to the local hospital two days ago because of new-onset upper abdominal pain. Although she was unable to describe the nature and character of the pain, it was not severe enough to require analgesics. One day prior to her admission to us, she developed vomiting that eventually became bilious.\nThe patient who had normal growth and development was on oral L-carnitine supplementation since infancy. Beside that, she was not receiving any other medications. Her family history was negative for pancreatitis. On admission to us, she was afebrile with normal vital signs. On physical examination, there was moderate upper abdominal tenderness without rebound, while she had normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Laboratory studies on admission revealed the following: leukocytes 10,110/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 14 g/dL, hematocrit 37.2%, platelets 169,000/\u03bcL, glucose 185 mg/dL (normal < 100 mg/dL), urea 26 mg/dL, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 3.6 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, AST 34 U/L, ALT 22 U/L, LDH 426 U/L (normal < 280 U/L), albumin 4.3 g/dL, total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, \u03b3-GT 16 U/L, triglycerides 80 mg/dL, calcium 10 mg/dL, and amylase 536 U/L (normal 40\u2013140 U/L). Arterial blood gases showed the following: pH 7.55, pCO2 21 mmHg, pO2 133 mmHg, HCO3 23 mmol/L, and base deficit 3.8 mmol/L. The anion gap was estimated at 7. A coagulation profile and a urine analysis were normal.\nDue to the bilious nature of vomiting, an abdominal ultrasound () was obtained that showed a notably enlarged and edematous pancreas, along with the presence of peripancreatic exudates that were extending bilaterally towards the anterior paranephric spaces and towards the right colon. The wall of the duodenum was also diffusely edematous. No gallstones were seen, the bile duct was not distended, and there was no sludge in it, while the liver, spleen, and appendix were visualized without echomorphologic abnormalities.\nSince the goal of management of acute pancreatitis is to achieve analgesia, adequate rehydration, and organ rest, the child was managed with discontinuation of oral feedings, placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous hydration with 5% dextrose with electrolytes, and administration of intravenous ranitidine and of L-carnitine, 500 mg every 8 hours, that is, approximately 100 mg/kg/day.\nThe patient's clinical course was uncomplicated. Serum amylase normalized (84 U/L) on the 4th hospital day. She was fed with a low-fat and protein diet on the 6th hospital day. On the same day, the intravenous fluids were discontinued. Two follow-up ultrasonographic examinations on the 3rd and 5th () hospital days showed progressive but rapid resolution of the pancreatic edema and of the peripancreatic exudates. Due to substantial clinical improvement, with complete disappearance of the abdominal pain, the child was discharged home without any complaints on the 8th hospital day. She continued to do well, two months after hospital discharge. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.\nDifferential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.\nAfter four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

On examination, patient was found to be febrile with temperature of 38.2 celsius, B.P 100/80 mmHg, respiratory rate (R.R) 24/min, and heart rate (H.R.) 130/min. Oxygen saturation on room air was 85%. Systemic examination revealed congested eyes, pharyngeal erythema, maculopapular skin rash involving face, upper limbs, and trunk. Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the right basal area and crackles on the left side posteriorly till the mid-zone. Basic laboratory work-up was as follows: WBC: 9.8 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, neutrophil: 7.7 \u00d7 103/UL, lymphocyte: 0.9 \u00d7 103/UL, BUN:2.80 mmol/L, creatinine: 88 \u03bcmol/L, Na: 129 mmol/L, K: 4 mmol/L, Cl: 99 mmol/L, HCO3: 18 mmol/L mmol/L, bilirubin T: 7.6 \u03bcmol/L, albumin: 28 gm/L, ALT: 50 U/L, AST: 84 U/L, ALP: 268 U/L, INR: O.9, CRP: 53, ESR: 29 and tacrolimus level: 3.4. Hepatic transaminases showed progressive increase over 2 days. Ultrasound of abdomen and liver was normal. A CT pulmonary angiogram was ordered due to the presence of tachypnoea, tachycardia and drop in oxygen saturation. It did not show any evidence of PE but showed bilateral basal lung infiltrates more on the right side with associated two large size basal lung cysts (Fig. ) .\nPatient was admitted as a case of viral exanthemata fever and bronchopneumonia with airborne precautions and was treated with intravenous antibiotics and fluids. The respiratory viral panel came negative. Viral serology results were positive for CMV Ab IgG, EBV nuclear antigen IgG, EBV capsid antigen IgG, rubella IgG Ab, measles IgG Ab, and measles IgM Ab. Autoimmune serologies and tuberculosis work-up were negative. On day 2 of admission, patient's skin rash started to fade from the face and patient showed clinical improvement with regard to fever and constitutional symptoms. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to evaluate lung infiltrates and cystic lung disease showed negative work-up for acid-fast bacilli, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and fungi. Measles virus PCR in serum was reported positive. She was managed with fluids and supportive measures. The patient improved clinically with the fading of skin rash gradually and normalization of liver enzymes over the next 5 days and was discharged home.

    "question": "A 60-year-old lady, a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years and hypertension for 3 years, presented to the clinic with fever, chills, and bilateral loin pain of 4 days duration. No other co-morbidities like chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease were known in her in the past and she was apparently in normal state of health prior to the presenting illness.\nShe developed high-grade fever with chills and rigors. Fever was accompanied by dysuria and bilateral loin pain which was constant and aching in nature. Two days following the onset of fever and loin pain, she developed hematuria and subsequently her urine output started declining and she was anuric at the time of admission to the hospital. She also experienced severe generalized muscle ache. There was no arthralgia, skin rash or hemoptysis. Her medications included glipizide and multivitamin.\nAt the time of admission, she was conscious, irritable, febrile, and tachypneic. Her conjunctivae appeared suffused. There was no icterus, purpura, or lymphadenopathy. Muscle tenderness in limbs was noted. Her pulse was 104/min, BP\u2013110/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate 23/min, temperature 101\u00b0F, oxygen saturation 95% at room air. Rales were appreciated in the basal regions of the chest. Examination of abdomen revealed no organomegaly, but both renal angles were tender on palpation.\nInvestigations revealed hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL; leukocyte count of 28400 cells/\u03bcL; differential count revealed polymorphs 91%, lymphocytes 8%; platelet count 60000/\u03bcL. The blood film revealed normocytic normochromic RBCs, neutrophilic leucocytosis with toxic granulations. No hemoparasites were detectable. Urine analysis revealed 1+ protein, 40-50 WBCs/high power field, 20-25 RBCs/high power field, bile salts and pigments - negative, ketone-negative. Blood sugar on admission was 208 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen 74 mg/ dL; serum creatinine 5.4 mg/dL; serum sodium 138 mmol/L; potassium 4.8 mmol/L; bicarbonate 7.0 mmol/L; chloride 104 mmol/L; plasma anion gap +27 mmol/L, pO290 mm Hg., pCO226 mm Hg. Serum total bilirubin measured 2.1 mg/dl; SGOT \u2013 44 U/L; SGPT \u2013 34 U/L; alkaline phosphatase \u2013 242 U/L; serum total protein 6.5 g/L; and serum albumin measured 2.4 g/ dL. Urine culture revealed significant growth of E. Coli., (>105 colony forming units/ ml) sensitive to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and ceftriaxone. However, blood culture grew no organism. Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed bilaterally enlarged kidneys with hydroureteronephrosis. No radioopaque lesion could be made out in the ultrasonogram or X-ray KUB region. An MR urogram performed to further evaluate the obstruction [] revealed bilateral renal papillary necrosis (RPN) with bilateral midureteric obstruction.\nThrombocytopenia and severe myalgia prompted a search for leptospirosis, a common cause of AKI in this part of the country. The organism could not be isolated from the urine or blood. However, the MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test) done in the second week of the illness detected Leptospira icterohemorrhagica; serovar hardjo. Serologic investigations for dengue were negative.\nShe was subjected to a USG-guided renal biopsy which revealed acute tubular necrosis, interstitial inflammation, and mild mesangial proliferation [Figure \u2013].\nThe patient was treated with hemodialysis and her antibiotics included benzyl penicillin and ceftriaxone. Gradually, the fever settled, her general condition stabilized, and renal function started to improve. By the 20th day of the illness, serum creatinine was 1.7 mg/ dL and platelet count was 190,000/\u03bcL and patient was discharged. Follow-up at 3 months revealed a serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL.

    "question": "A 66-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with complaints of chronic weakness, fatigue, myalgia, weight loss, and left flank pain. Comorbidities included hypertension, active smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Patient denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, or any shortness of breath. He had a recent admission due to community acquired pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics. He denied using any illicit drugs or alcohol abuse. He was retired truck driver by profession.\nOn examination, he was an elderly man with clinical signs of dehydration. Blood pressure was 155/56 mm Hg, heart rate was 67/min, respiratory rate was 16/min, was afebrile, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He had mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rigidity. He had bilateral lower extremities chronic skin changes with scaling. The rest of the physical examination was normal.\nSignificant laboratory data revealed serum sodium 124 mEq/mL, potassium 5.1 mEq/mL, chloride 89 mEq/mL, bicarbonate 15 mEq/mL, blood urea nitrogen 44 mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, glucose 85 mg/dL, calcium 10.3 mg/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, and albumin 2.9 g/dL. The rest of the liver function tests were within normal limit. Anemia was with hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit 27%, platelets 558 k/\u03bcL, and white blood cells 10.4 k/\u03bcL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 25 mm Hg, pO2 of 90.3 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. There was an anion gap of 20, lactic acid of 4.8 mmoles/L, serum lipase of 1540 U/L, amylase 406 unit/L, gamma GT 25 unit/L, INR 1.3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 950 unit/L; cancer antigen CA 19-9 was 49.9 \u03bc/mL, TSH was 2.25 mIU/L, serum acetone was negative, and alcohol level was less than 10 mg/dL. His serial cardiac enzymes were negative and he was ruled out for an acute coronary event.\nChest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral patchy airspace disease. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with homogeneous attenuation and without significant peripancreatic inflammation () with extensive retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy (). A para-aortic lymph node measuring 2.1 cm and retrocaval lymph node measuring 1.6 cm were seen. A soft tissue density surrounding the right common iliac vessels likely representing confluent adenopathy was seen. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 67%; right ventricle systolic pressure was estimated to be 44 mm Hg. Pericardium was normal without any pericardial effusion. There was no significant valvular abnormality.\nInitially, the patients EKG showed 2nd degree Mobitz type I block which later progressed to complete heart block. Patient was given atropine without improvement; hence, a temporary pacemaker was inserted. He was started on IV hydration and IV antibiotics and all his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. His temporary pacemaker lead came out and it was removed. Subsequently he became unresponsive, was orally intubated, had four cardiac arrests, and was successfully resuscitated. Due to persistent pulmonary infiltrates he underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies which showed evidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). He was started on Bactrim for the treatment of PJP. He tested positive for HIV and was found to have a CD 4 count of 12/uL.\nA temporary pacemaker wire was again placed after ruling out the relevant reversible causes of third degree heart block. A repeat echocardiogram was unchanged from prior one. CT-guided biopsy of the para-aortic lymph nodes was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with marked tumor necrosis (). Immunoprofile showed that CD 20 (), CD 79a, and CD 10 were positive. CD 43, CD 3, CD 7, and BcL were negative. Upper endoscopy for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement showed gastric polyps which revealed gastric lymphoma on biopsy.\nPatient was not a candidate for chemotherapy or ART due to critical condition. Hospital course was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and eventual death a month into his hospital stay.

    "question": "A 23-yr-old woman with type 2 DM and Graves' disease has revisited to the Department of Emergency of Gyeongsang National University Hospital due to nausea, generalized weakness, polyuria and weight loss of 5 kg for 7 days in October 2003 since she was discharged from our hospital three weeks before. She was previously diagnosed as type 2 DM in 1996, and recently started insulin treatment to improve glycemic control due to persistently elevated HbA1c irrespective of oral administration of hypoglycemic agents. Three years before, she had taken propylthiouracil for hyperthyroid Graves' disease for 2 yr. In May 2003, she was diagnosed as relapse of hyperthyroidism at a local clinic and referred to our hospital for management of thyrotoxicosis refractory to usual dosage of propylthiouracil, 300 mg/day and proliferative diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. She had 7.9 mM/L fasting blood glucose, 1.07 nM/L C-peptide (reference range [RR], 0.1-0.83), 222 mM/L fructosamine (RR, 205-285), 8.3% HbA1c (RR, 4.5-5.6) and 0.01 mU/L TSH and 2.02 pM/L free T3 on thryoid function tests. At that time, Her weight was 54 kg and height was 147 cm (body mass index, 25.0 kg/m2). Her thyroid had the volume of about 40 g and it looked diffusely enlarged and rubbery consistency on palpation. The technetium-99m (Tc-99m) thyroid scan revealed marginally increased and somewhat irregular uptake (3.8%). As from hospitalization, the patient had oral administration of relatively high dose of methimazole (60 mg daily), propranolol (160 mg daily) and 12 drops of Lugol's solution (three times a day) for 14 days, and consecutively lithium carbonate (900 mg daily) for 14 days because of persisting tachycardia (>110/ min), dyspnea on exertion and still high concentration of free T3 (4.44 pM/L). She was discharged with receiving methimazole (60 mg daily) and beta-blocker ().\nShe had no family history of thyroid disease, but both parents have been suffering from type 2 DM. She denied ingestion of any drugs including alcohol or excessive consumption of fizzy drinks these days. She also has been adhering to administration of antithyroid drug, beta-blocker and insulin (0.5 units/kg/day) since being discharged. On physical examination, the patient had 143/89 mmHg blood pressure, 36.8\u2103 body temperature, 22/min respiration rate, and 121/min pulse rate. She looked acutely ill, and had slightly tremulous, warmhands, and decreased skin turgor and dried tongue. She was 48 kg weight and body mass index 22.2 kg/m2. Exophthalmos was not present. The abdomen was soft and flat, and liver and spleen were not palpable.\nOn admission, her laboratory findings were as follows; hemoglobin 12.3 g/dL, WBC 8.65\u00d7109/L (segmented neutrophil 58%, lymphocyte 29%), platelet 398\u00d7109/L, total protein 65 g/L, albumin 32 g/L, ALP 3.47 ukat/L, AST 0.42 ukat/L, ALT 0.6 ukat/L, BUN 9.2 mM/L and creatinine 88.7 \u00b5M/L. Levels of blood glucose (32.7 mM/L) and fructosamine (396 mM/L) were elevated. Her serum electrolytes and blood gas parameters were as follows: sodium 144.1 mM/L, potassium 5.4 mM/L, chloride 102 mM/L, calcium 2.5 mM/L, phosphorus 1.0 mM/L, pH 7.32, pCO2 35 mmHg, pO2 98 mmHg, and bicarbonate 16 mM/L. The fasting serum C-peptide was 0.44 nM/L. Serum anion gap was 20.9 and osmolarity was calculated as 321 mosm/kg. Amylase and lipase levels were normal and anti-GAD antibody was negative. Thyroid function tests revealed that the patient had more aggravated hyperthyroid state; 0.01 mU/L TSH, 2.78 pM/L free T3 and 45.38 pM/L free T4 (RR, 11.41-23.08) than when she was hospitalized two weeks before (0.12 mU/L TSH, 1.41 pM/L free T3 and 30.26 pM/L free T4). TSH-receptor antibody level was 26.3 IU/L (RR, <1) and antimicrosomal antibody was 29.3 U/mL (RR, <60). The Tc-99m scan showed still enlarged thyroid with more increased uptake 6.5% than previous uptake scan (3.8%) performed taking propylthiouracil two months before. Based on above results, the patient was diagnosed as HHS accompanying mild ketosis on type 2 DM and aggravated Graves' hyperthyroidism. We treated her with intravenous insulin injection and large volume of intravenous fluid administration. And also, she took high dose of methimazole (90 mg daily, six times a day) and beta-blockers. On the second day, nausea and generalized weakness have been improved.\nAt two months after acute presentation, we measured levels of C-peptide after 75 g glucose loading; 0 min (0.12 nM/L), 30 min (0.74 nM/L), 60 min (1.02 nM/L), 90 min (1.49 nM/L) and 120 min (1.32 nML). Throughout follow-ups for 2 months, she took insulin (0.9 units/kg/day), metformin (1,500 mg daily) and methimazole (45 mg daily). The mean fasting capillary blood glucose level on self monitoring was rather elevated than the target, but free T3 level became normalized ().

    "question": "A 52-years-old female was visited to our hospital emergency department due to abrupt onset of headache, fever, and vomiting. On her past history she suffered from chronic sinusitis 10 years ago. Two years ago, she received right total maxillectomy for treatment of right maxillary sinus infection with necrosis. Since one year ago, she experienced orthopedic surgery of open reduction and internal fixation of both femur due to slip down injury (). She had no history of hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. Family history of other family members could not obtained except her elder sister because she did not wanted disclose her disease further to her family members. Her elder sister diagnosed osteopetrosis 12 years ago during dental procedure and had past history of femur fracture since 22 years ago. On her social history, she took intermittent alcohol consumption without smoking.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, she had a systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg, diastolic pressure of 70 mmHg, pulse rate of 133 per minute, breathing rate of 22 per minute, body temperature of 38.3\u2103. She had 153 cm of height, 40.1 kg of body weight, and 17.1 kg/m2 of body mass index (BMI). On physical and neurological examination, she showed right eye proptosis and lateral gaze palsy, left hearing disturbance, and left facial nerve area sensory deficit.\nLaboratory examinations were performed at the time of visiting; leukocyte was 14,000/mm3 (reference range 4,000-10,000), hemoglobin was 10.6 g/dL (reference range 12.0-16.0), platelet count was 354,000/mm3 (reference range 140,000-400,000), erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 81 mm/hr (reference range 0-20), and C-reactive protein was 18.12 mg/dL (reference range 0-0.50). Blood chemistry showed serum albumin 3.7 g/dL (reference range 3.5-5.0), total calcium 7.8 mg/dL (reference range 7.8-10.0), phosphorus 1.6 mg/dL (reference range 2.9-4.3), ionized calcium 0.89 mM/L (reference range 0.96-1.40), sodium 125 mM/L (reference range 137-150), potassium 4.1 mM/L (reference range 3.5-5.3), chloride 87 mmol/L (reference range 99-110), bicarbonate 28 mmol/L (reference range 22-34).\nRadiographs of chest and PNS showed diffuse sclerotic change in bony structures (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed leptomeningitis with abscess formation along right Meckel's cave and right cavernous sinus wall ().\nEmpirical parenteral antibiotics were started with ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and vancomycin for cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis and meningitis. Antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone alone after obtained blood culture results with streptococcus constellatus, milleri infection.\nTen days after admission, she showed symptoms of febrile sensation, vomiting, whirling type vertigo, and generalized tonic chronic seizure attack. Mental status changed from alert to deep drowsy. On brain MRI scan, epidural empyema along right frontotemporal convexity and aggravation of meningeal enhancement were seen (). She was moved to intensive care unit and antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and metronidazole because antibiotics therapy with ceftriaxone alone caused aggravation of patient's symptom. Intravenous (IV) steroid and mannitol were administered to control increased intracranial pressure. Prompt neurosurgical decompression was indicated, but neurosurgery was not done due to refusal of operation by family members, patient's poor nutritional status like extremely low BMI and sclerotic bone disease with possibility of nonunion after operation. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, red blood cell 0/mm3, leukocyte 800/mm3 on fluid analysis, but micro-organism was not grown.\nThirteen days after admission, she was transferred to general ward because her mental status changed to alert again with no further seizure attack. Seventeen days after admission, fever was developed again, so metronidazole was changed to meropenem to cover broader spectrum of infection. Vancomycin was stopped for 2 weeks later because fever was developed during previous vancomycin usage, and maintained meropenem alone for further 10 weeks. On endoscopic examination, sphenoid sinus was suspected to focus of infection. Five weeks after admission, she got a right sphenoidotomy under local anesthesia. Complete resolution of infection was obtained after broad spectrum antibiotic therapy for 12 weeks.\nFor etiologic evaluation, we tested further examination for diffuse sclerosing bony structure. Laboratory data revealed elevated serum levels of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) without carbonic anhydrase II DNA mutation, the intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was elevated by 144.04 pg/mL (reference range 15-65), the 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D (1,25-[OH]2D) was elevated by 91.0 pg/mL (reference range 20.0-60.0), and the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-[OH]D3) was decreased by 11.43 ng/mL (reference range 20-30). Results of bone formation and resorption marker were various with the value of bone alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme 34.2 g/L (age and gender specific reference range below 22), osteocalcin 10.4 ng/mL (age and gender specific reference range 4.0-12.0), and deoxypyridinoline 9.5 nM deoxypyridinoline (DPD)/mM (reference range 3.0-7.4), respectively. A plain radiograph of the spine showed end-plate thickening and sclerosis producing the classic \"sandwich vertebra\" appearance (). Bone mineral densitometry showed increased lumbar spine vertebral bone density and bone mineral content values (bone mineral density 2.713 g/cm2 with T-score +14.84, bone mineral content of lumbar spine 173.28 g). For evaluation of chloride channel 7 (CLCN7) deficiency osteopetrosis, we performed a CLCN7 gene mutation analysis using genomic DNA which was extracted from peripheral blood using genomic DNA prep kit (Solgent Co. Ltd., Daejeon, Korea). But we could not found any mutations on 24 and 25 exon of CLCN7 gene. And her older sister's spine X-ray also showed sandwich vertebra appearance () and the CLCN7 gene mutation was not found, too. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "Ms. JB, a 66-year-old Caucasian woman, was admitted to our inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit from her long term care (LTC) facility because of behavioral disturbances associated with her dementing illness. She was resistant to care, was having persistent vocalization, and was hallucinating. Functionally, she required full assistance with all her ADLs. Her past medical history included early-onset dementia of Alzheimer's type, severe, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and dysphagia. The patient did not have a history of psychiatric illness including anxiety, psychosis, substance abuse, or psychiatric hospitalizations.\nHer medications at admission to our unit were multivitamins, citalopram 20 mg po daily, simvastatin 40 mg po daily, Vitamin D3 1000 IU po daily, calcium carbonate 600 mg po bid, valproic acid sprinkles 375 mg po twice daily, docusate 100 mg po twice daily, and risperidone 0.5 mg po twice daily.\nOur review of record, indicates that the patient was being treated with citalopram, valproic acid sprinkles, and risperidone for the behavioral disturbances associated with her dementia. It is unclear exactly as to when the valproic acid sprinkles was started, but it appears that the patient was taking this drug for at least the last month prior to her hospitalization.\nOn admission examination, the patient was noted to be perseveratively calling out and crying. Her vital signs were stable, and she was uncooperative to the examination. She was underweight, at 66 inches in height, 99 lbs in weight, and body mass index (BMI) = 16 kg/m2. Despite her history of hypertension, her blood pressure (BP) on admission was low at 96/57 mm hg. She was noted to have a dysconjugate gaze. She had marked jerking movements of her upper extremities consistent with myoclonus. Muscle tone was increased, and it was difficult to assess for cogwheeling, as patient was unable to voluntarily relax her extremities. Myoclonus in her lower extremities was also noted when her feet were dorsiflexed. She was disoriented to time, place, and person and was unable to participate in a formal cognitive testing.\nLaboratory examination on admission revealed a low serum albumin of 3.4 gm/dL. Her ammonia level was low normal at 4 umol/L. Her valproic acid level was 39 mg/L, a level generally considered to be subtherapeutic for patients with seizure disorders. Sodium was 143 meq/L, potassium was 3.7 meq/L, chloride was 104 meq/L, bicarbonate was 33 meq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 12 mg/dL, serum creatinine was 0.7 mg/dL, glucose was 91 mg/dL, serum calcium was 8.5 mg/dL, aspartate transamisase (AST) was 7 iu/L, and alanine transaminase (ALT) was 21 iu/L. Vitamin B12, folate, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were normal. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Complete blood count (CBC) was normal with a white cell count of 8100/cmm, a hemoglobin level of 13.7 gm/dL, and a hematocrit of 41.2%.\nFollowing the initial evaluation, the VPA dose was decreased and then discontinued, with complete resolution of her myoclonus. Quetiapine was started and titrated to 25 mg po at noon and 12.5 mg po at 5 pm for agitation. Because of her late afternoon agitation, risperidone 0.5 mg was increased from twice a day to 0.5 mg po three times a day, with the additional dose given in the early afternoon. Her restlessness, agitation, vocalizations, hallucinations and resistance to care were significantly decreased from admission on this medication regimen. She was discharged back to her long term care facility in a stable state. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 36-year-old Kenyan woman, primigravida at 34-week spontaneous pregnancy, admitted to women hospital on April 12, 2008, with recurrent vomiting and epigastric pain. She was diagnosed with uterine fibroid since the first month of her pregnancy, but the pregnancy had been uneventful. She had history of weight loss (10 kg), no change in bowel habits, no hematemesis or rectal bleeding, and no history of hematuria or passing stones. The patient was using iron tablets; otherwise her medical history was unremarkable. On examination, she looked ill, markedly dehydrated, and drowsy. Her blood pressure was 126/76 mmHg, pulse rate 94 min\u20131, respiratory rate 30 min\u20131, and temperature 36.6\u00b0C; she had no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly, and no edema. Abdominal examination showed a uterus size of 40 weeks and tender epigastric area. Neurological examination showed a drowsy and hypotonic lady with brisk deep tendon reflexes. There was no obvious focal neurological sign. Planter reflexes were down-going. Chest and cardiovascular systems were unremarkable.\nThe findings of initial investigations were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb) 8.7 g/dl, WBCs 7000 \u03bcl\u20131, platelets 445 000 \u03bcl\u20131; and ESR 109 mm/h. Peripheral blood smear showed toxic granulation of WBCs. Blood chemistry: BUN 4.4 mmol/l, creatinine 59 \u03bcmol/l, HCO3 22 mmol/l, Na 138 mmol/l, Ca 4.8 mmol/l (normal: 2.1-2.6), uric acid 508 \u03bcmol/l, lactic acid 1.2 mmol/l, and phosphorous 0.8 mmol/l. HIV serology was negative. A retrospective measurement of calcium at 14 weeks\u2019 gestation was obtained at 2.43 mmol/l. Liver function test: ALT 4 u/l, AST 11 u/l, ALP 150 u/l, total protein 72 g/l, and albumen 30 g/l. Lipid profile: cholesterol 4.05 mmol/l and triglyceride 3.59 mmol/l. Hormone study: PTH 3 pg/ml (normal:15-65), TSH 0.68 mIU/l (normal: 0.45-4.5), free thyroxin 16.6 pmol/l (normal: 9-20), cortisol 1849 nmol/l, and vitamin D 15 ng/ml (normal: 30-80). Serum protein electrophoresis as well as serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal.\nIn consultation with the internist, the patient was given normal saline infusion at 250 ml/h with close monitoring of her urine output plus intramuscular calcitonin, and she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit.\nBased on these laboratory findings, the possible diagnosis was humoral hypercalcemia of benignancy (uterine fibroid). PTH-rP is the primary mediator that causes hypercalcemia. However, we did not check for the PTH-rP level because of lack of facilities.\nIn the intensive care unit, the patient developed rupture membrane, which entailed urgent cesarean section while calcium remained high. However, because of hypercalcemia and reduction in the urine output with a rise in serum creatinine, the nephrologist was consulted for urgent hemodialysis before the operation. The surgery was complicated by bleeding, leading to hypotension requiring blood transfusion despite the successful delivery of a baby girl weighing 2.9 kg and removal of uterine masses measuring in aggregate 30 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 15 cm, which were submitted to a histopathological examination and the histopathology report was consistent with leiomyoma with calcifications but no evidence of malignancy. The postoperative clinical course was further complicated by septicemia and septic shock, which required vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nPostoperative laboratory test results were as follows: serum calcium 2.34 mmol/l, phosphorus 1.1 mmol/l, BUN 6.2 mmol/l, Cr 75 mmol/l, Na 143 mmol/l, K 4.2 mmol/l, HCO3 16 mEq/l, chloride 113 mEq/l, albumin 21 g/l, serum lactate 5.19, serum PTH 155 pg/ml, serum amylase 88 u/l, serum lipase 73 u/l; Hb 5.8 g/dl, platelets 125 000 \u03bcl1. The CT scan of the chest and pelvis showed no evidence of mass lesion or organomegaly. MRI of the brain that was done because of the deterioration in the level of consciousness showed evidence of infarcts involving the right cerebellum, the lentiform nucleus on both sides, as well as the cortical regions in frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. MRA revealed evidence of vasospasm of the internal carotid, the middle and the anterior carotid arteries; the findings are suggestive of diffuse ischemic changes secondary to hypoxic insult. Subsequently, her condition began to improve but her neurological status required extensive physiotherapy for the generalized muscle weakness and stiffness. The patient was discharged home, with a final diagnosis of humoral hypercalcemia associated with a uterine fibroid. Serum calcium remained within the normal range over the subsequent 6 months [].

    "question": "A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37\u00b0C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.\nCreatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015. No pigmented granular casts. His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic\u2013antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear\u2013antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti\u2013glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.\nHis chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.\nThe patient\u2019s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.\nRenal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

    "question": "A 66-year-old morbidly obese woman presented to the ED with generalized weakness over the last seven days, oliguria, poor appetite, and thirst. Her past medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, restrictive lung disease, morbid obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She had no history of cancer or multiple myeloma, or renal disease as evident from past admissions.\nUpon presentation to the ED, she was found to have a serum creatinine of 5 mg/dL (her baseline was 0.5 mg/dL) and a serum calcium level of 23.1 mg/dL (normal reference range: 8-10.4 mg/dL) and ionized calcium of 3.23 mg/dL (normal reference range: 4.23-5.11 mg/dL). Her albumin was 3.9 g/dL, within normal range, indicating true hypercalcemia. CT of her abdomen and pelvis revealed an 18 mm cyst in upper pole of the right kidney with a parapelvic cyst measuring 18 mm x 18 mm (Figure ). Chest X-ray (CXR), CT of head also did not show any significant pathology. Her other labs included a white blood cell (WBC) 14.14, hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, platelet 427,000 platelets per microliter, sodium 131 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, chloride 89 mEq/L, carbon dioxide 36 mEq/L (normal reference 20-32 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 62 mg/dL, magnesium 3 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 71 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 46 IU/L, troponin 39 ng/mL, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) 435 pg/mL, international normalized ratio (INR) less than 0, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) more than 212 s. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) showed intraventricular right bundle branch block (Figure ). Her vitals included a temperature of 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse of 72 beats/min, and blood pressure of 160 over 83 millimeters of mercury. A hypercalcemia work-up was done which included parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related protein, and serum protein electrophoresis. PTH was found to be low at 13.9 pg/mL (normal range 15-75 pg/mL) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) was less than 2 pmol/L, normal. Serum immunofixation showed no monoclonal band, and serum and urine protein electrophoresis were unremarkable. Viral hepatitis serologies were negative. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was 3.14 uIU/mL, normal. Vitamin D 25-hydroxy was normal, 50.3 ng/mL.\nTreatment was initiated with fluid resuscitation (1 L normal saline bolus), the bisphosphonate Zometa (Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL), and Miacalcin (Mylan, Rockford, IL). A temporary dialysis catheter was placed and dialysis treatment was initiated 12 h later (day two), and again on day three due to a persistently elevated serum calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL. Dialysis was necessary as Zometa and Miacalcin were not working fast enough to ensure a positive outcome alone. In addition, there was concern for acute tubular necrosis due to Zometa in our patient with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min (Figures -, Table ). The patient\u2019s serum creatinine and calcium levels improved by day six and patient was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 17.7-year-old male was referred to our hospital due to sclerotic changes in bony structures. Approximately one month prior to referral, the patient started complaining of pain in the right shin. X-rays in a local clinic revealed a generalized increase in bone density.\nThe patient\u2019s history revealed that he weighed 3.8 kg (75th percentile) at birth. He had no history of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes or hepatitis. The patient and his family, including his parents and younger sister had no history of bone fractures. His aunt was suspected of having a bone-related disease, but she did not present for examination. The patient suffered from chronic otitis media and was diagnosed with partial hearing loss when he was 16 years old. On physical and neurological examination, no specific findings were noted. His current height and weight were 170.6 cm (50th percentile) and 69.0 kg (75th percentile), respectively.\nPlain radiographs showed a generalized increase in bone density involving the skull, vertebrae and pelvis. X-rays of the skull showed thickening and increased skull-base density (). X-rays of the spine showed typical end-plate thickening and sclerosis producing the classic \u201csandwich vertebrae\u201d appearance (). Sandwich vertebra is a radiologic finding in which the endplates are densely sclerotic, resulting in the sandwich appearance. X-rays of the pelvis showed the \u201cbone-within-bone\u201d appearance, primarily in the iliac wings (). The other family members, including his younger sister, mother and father, showed normal bone density. shows normal bone appearance in the patient\u2019s father. Bone mineral densitometry (BMD) of the antero-posterior lumbar spine vertebrae, L1-L4, was measured as 2.466 g/cm2 (Z-score=10.7) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry on a Lunar Prodigy (Lunar, Madison, WI, USA). The BMD of the left femoral neck, trochanter and Ward\u2019s triangle were measured as 1.966 g/cm2 (Z-score=7.0) (), 1.825 g/cm2, and 1.943 g/cm2, respectively. Blood chemistry showed the following: serum albumin 4.4 g/dL (reference range 3.5-5.2 g/dL), total calcium 9.5 mg/dL (8.6-10.2 mg/dL), elevated phosphorus 5.0 mg/dL (2.7-4.5 mg/dL), ionized calcium 4.81 mg/dL (4.48-4.92 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase: 108 U/L (40-129 U/L), sodium 145 mmol/L, potassium at 4.4 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L and bicarbonate 28.4 mmol/L. The intact parathyroid hormone level was slightly elevated, being 79.5 pg/mL (reference range: 14-72 pg/mL), 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 level was 25.7 ng/mL (insufficiency range: 10-30 ng/mL) and thyroid stimulating hormone 5.38 uIU/mL (reference range: 0.27-4.20 uIU/mL).\nFor evaluation of osteopetrosis, targeted gene panel sequencing was performed to check for the presence of pathogenic variants of multiple associated genes responsible for osteopetrosis. After informed consent, 3 mL of blood was obtained from the patient, sister and both parents. A library preparation was performed using the TruSight One Sequencing Panel (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), which enriches a 12-Mb region spanning 62,000 target exons of a total of 4,813 clinically relevant genes. Massively parallel sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq platform. Sequence reads were mapped to UCSC hg19 standard base for comparative analysis. The results of targeted gene panel sequencing revealed heterozygous missense mutation c.746C>T (p.Pro249Leu) in exon 9 of the CLCN7 gene in the proband, which was previously reported in a patient with ADO-2 (): There was no pathogenic variant in other genes. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of this variant, and the same heterozygous variant was only found in the patient\u2019s father (). However, the father denied having any complaints including history of fracture, osteomyelitis, visual impairment and hearing problem. Radiographs of his bones were also normal (). We did not evaluate bone mineral density in the patient\u2019s father, as his X-rays were of normal appearance. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

Urine for ketone bodies was negative. His HbA1C was 11.8%. ECG and chest X-ray were normal. 24-hour urinary protein was 100 mg/dL. The USG abdomen was normal. Patient was initially managed with IV normal saline and potassium replacement. After initial resuscitation with IV fluids, and potassium replacement, the patient's blood sugar stabilized to 172 mg/dL random; however, metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia persisted. Then, the possibility of dRTA was thought of. Anion gap was calculated as Na \u2013 [HCO3 + Cl], which was normal: 137 \u2013 [12.1 + 116] = 8.9 mEq/L. Furthermore, urine pH was 6.0 even at a serum pH of 7.20. The patient was diagnosed as dRTA in view of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with hypokalemia with inability to acidify urine in the presence of systemic metabolic acidosis. Meanwhile, the patient started tolerating oral intake and was started on oral feeds with pre-meal subcutaneous regular insulin. Subsequently, the patient was put on oral sodium bicarbonate tablets at a dose of 2 mEq/kg and oral potassium replacement. His metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia improved markedly. He was discharged with a final diagnosis of T1DM with dRTA. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 61-year-old man presented to the ED after having black stools for 24 hours. This episode was preceded by the spontaneous onset of abdominal cramps, followed by dyspnea, fatigue, and light-headedness. His prior medical history included multiple hospital admissions for upper GI bleeding. There was no history of smoking, alcohol intake, or illicit drug use. On initial examination, he appeared lethargic, with a blood pressure of 101/55 mmHg, a pulse of 83 beats/minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% while breathing room air. He had conjunctival pallor. Cardiovascular examination revealed a systolic ejection murmur with late systolic peaking and soft second heart sounds. Laboratory tests showed a blood glucose concentration of 101 mg/dL, a white blood cell count of 4.6 x 109/L, a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dL, and a platelet count of 207 x 109/L. Other laboratory tests showed sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 22 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 21 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. He was deficient in high molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Abdominal CT and upper GI endoscopy yielded negative results. A previous capsule examination of the small bowel had been negative. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a severely sclerotic aortic valve with area of 0.65 cm2 and left ventricular ejection fraction 65% (Figure ).\nThe patient was treated with intravenous administration of the proton pump inhibitor octreotide as well as two units of packed red blood cells. Because of his history of chronic GI bleeding, anemia, and AS, he was diagnosed with Heyde syndrome, a diagnosis supported by the deficiency in high molecular weight multimers of vWF.\nThe patient underwent a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement, with the insertion of a 27-mm tissue valve. At the present writing, three years after the procedure, the patient has been asymptomatic with no further episodes of bleeding. What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 \u03bcg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL.

    "question": "A 47-year-old man arrived to the emergency room due to generalized tonic-clonic seizures and altered mental status. He had a history of long-standing uncontrolled type 2 diabetes treated irregularly with insulin and metformin (HbA1c 10.1%), with no known microvascular or macrovascular complications. He had no history of alcohol consumption and twenty-four hours earlier he referred nocturia, polyuria and polydipsia. On the day of admission, while asleep, he suddenly developed three consecutive episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures along with urinary sphincter loss and subsequent postictal state.\nOn physical examination he was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 per minute, temperature 36.5\u00b0C, and room-air oxygen saturation of 98%. His body mass index was 32.2. Mucous membranes were remarkably dry. The patient was lethargic and had a Glasgow coma scale of 11/15, muscle strength was 4/5 in both lower extremities, and deep tendon reflexes were diminished. Cranial nerves were normal, sensitivity was preserved, and meningeal signs and primitive reflexes were absent. Due to the patient status cerebellum function could not be evaluated. Finger-stick glucose could not be recorded due to high blood glucose levels and venous blood gas analysis reported pH 7.36, PCO2 42 mmHg, PO2 32 mmHg, lactate 1.2 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 23.7 mEq/L. Urinary and plasma ketones were negative. Hydration with intravenous normal saline solution at 500 mL/h and an insulin infusion at 0.14 U/kg were started. Plasma glucose was 838 mg/dL (46.5 mmol/L), blood nitrogen urea 21 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL with a MDRD calculated glomerular filtration rate of 71 mL/min, serum sodium 133 mmol/L, and chlorine 89 mmol/L. Calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, hemoglobin, white blood count, and platelets were all within normal limits. Serum albumin was 2.1 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase 192 UI/L, alanine aminotransferase 19 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 21 U/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, and serum osmolality 320 mOsm/kg ().\nHead computed tomography, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray were normal. The patient after 24 hours of treatment continued with altered mental status and paraparesis progressed (3/5). Plasma glucose was lowered down carefully at a rate of 30\u201340 mg/dL/hr and was within 200\u2013300 mg/dL []. Serum osmolality dropped down to 305 mOsm/Kg (). Twenty-four hours after admission a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered and revealed increased signal intensity on T2-weighted FLAIR images with restricted diffusion in the medulla and central pons (). Mammillary bodies, thalamus, third ventricle, and both hemispheres were respected. Lumbar puncture was normal, electroencephalogram showed a nonspecific wave activity, and urinary and serum toxicology panel were negative. During all his admission serum sodium was documented to be within normal range. ODS was diagnosed and aggressive supportive therapy was started. During the next 3 weeks the patient progressively regained consciousness and muscle strength and was able to feed himself. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and MRI showed no residual damage. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 69 year old Hispanic female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post revascularization, ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease had presented to our hospital for further evaluation and care. For the past few months the patient had suffered weight loss (approximately 30\u201335 lb), generalized malaise, low grade fevers (99.9 F), non-productive cough, myalgias and arthralgias. She did not endorse any night sweats or recent travel history, and there were no sick contacts at home. Prior to admission to our institution the patient was at an outside hospital and was being treated for sepsis with combinations of antibiotics including intravenous vancomycin, meropenem, echinocandin, metronidazole, and piperacillin tazobactam for 2 to 3 weeks duration as she was developing fevers and productive cough.\nThe physical exam yielded a thin and chronically ill appearing female patient.\nVital signs at the time of admission were notable for hypertension (186/79 mmHg). Her eyes did not show any conjunctival hemorrhaging or icterus, however there was conjunctival pallor. Oropharynx did not show any active exudates or ulcerative lesions. Her cardiac exam did not reveal any murmurs and her airways were clear to auscultation. Abdominal exam revealed palpable splenomegaly. Examination of the extremities did not show nail deformities including splinter hemorrhages or nail pitting. Her skin had no evidence of skin nodularities or other lesions. There was a 1 cm non tender, movable left axillary lymph node. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nInitial laboratory work revealed that the patient had pancytopenia. White blood cell count (WBC) was stated at 2.4 K/uL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.92 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 11.6, and platelet count of 39,000/uL. B2-microglobulin was seen elevated at 9.2 mg/L. Basic metabolic panel obtained showed sodium 134 mEq/L, Potassium 3.5 mEq/L, Chloride 103 mEq/L, Bicarbonate 26 mEq/L, Blood urea nitrogen 30 mg/dl, Creatinine 0.90 mg/dl, glucose 220 mg/dl. Liver function panel showed Albumin 2.2 g/dl, normal transaminases, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl. Urine analysis showed 200 mg/dl of protein and occasional amorphous crystals.\nInitial computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis during hospital admission showed a 15 cm spleen which was heterogenous and micronodular, as well as scattered abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy (Fig. ). No imaging signs of portal hypertension were noted.\nDuring the hospitalization our patient was noted to become more confused and agitated, and there was concern that the patient was having seizures as she was seen numerous times to lose consciousness and awaken, with occasional loss of bladder function. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed subcortical non enhancing FLAIR hyper intense foci in the bilateral posterior occipital lobes.\nLumbar puncture and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) studies were further performed for further analysis, and showed: WBC 1; no red blood cells; protein 62 mg/dL; glucose 35 mg/dL; and, lactate dehydrogenase 234 mIU/mL. Most notable negative findings in the CSF included no detectable viral cultures for cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, herpes virus, and varicella zoster virus, negative cryptococcal antigen serology and negative bacterial and fungal cultures.\nElectroencephalogram studies showed triphasic morphology waves with and without sharp negative component at 2\u20133 hertz. These were seen in continuum mostly with subtle waxing and waning features. To 0.5 mg intravenous alprazolam, above discharges had slowly resolved, replaced by organized background that consists of 6 hertz rhythms. Importantly, there was a clinical improvement after alprazolam; suggesting a nonconvulsive seizures responding to benzodiazepine.\nTwo weeks later after the initial CT imaging and after the patient was more stable from the neurological perspective in order to attempt a lymph node excisional biopsy, a PET-CT imaging was performed and showed complete resolution of the previously detected lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. (Fig. ).\nAdditional serologies for viral hepatitis and autoimmune etiology work up were performed. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and additional serum erythropoietin level, iron profile; cobalamin and folate level were determined.\nThe patient returned to the benign hematology clinic after discharged from the hospital. During her follow up appointment she appeared in better spirits and recovering well. Physical examination was notable for an absence of lymphadenopathy particularly in the cervical and axillary region, as well as no palpable organomegaly in the abdomen. It was further revealed that her antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer was highly positive (1:640), ESR 108 mm/hr with a CRP 6.74 mg/L. Negative viral hepatitis B, C and Human Immunodeficiency virus serologies.\nSerum quantitative immunoglobulin showed a mildly elevated Ig A and Ig G level, without other abnormalities. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis did not reveal a monoclonal gammopathy. Serum free light chain levels showed kappa 96.3 mg/L and lambda 60.06 mg/dL with a normal ratio 1.6 in a patient with chronic kidney disease.\nComplement C3 level was normal with a slightly elevated C4 at 46 mg/dL.\nBone marrow aspirate yielded a predominance of CD3 positive polytypical small T cells and a population of polyclonal B-cells by flow cytometry and negative for lymphoma or other malignant process. A focal lymphohistiocytic aggregate with granuloma formation was noted; occasional larger cells with prominent nucleolus identified; eosinophils were increased mildly in the vicinity of this aggregate. Acid fast bacilli and fungal stains were attempted; however the focal granuloma could not be appreciated at subsequent sections.\nThe patient\u2019s pancytopenia was thought to be likely secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and she was thus referred to rheumatology for further work up, and further testing included anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-RNP, anti-CCP antibody, ANCA vasculitis panel, direct antiglobulin test, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and anti-SSA and anti-SSB. All these tests were negative, thus ruling out systemic erythematous lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other connective tissue disorders.\nThe interval improvement and self-limited clinical course in our case led us to believe that her elevated ANA titers, her bone marrow granuloma were secondary to an EBV infection-related syndrome. Monospot test was not performed and at that point we evaluated for EBV PCR and EBER staining in the bone marrow. Initial EBV PCR results were positive (960 copies/mL), while Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs staining in the bone marrow was negative. Our in situ hybridization stain is validated to work on decalcified bone marrow trephine biopsies and all stains include an on-slide positive control. As such, the likelihood of a false negative result is low. A possible explanation includes a sampling factor with lack of infected B-cells in the bone marrow despite the presence of viremia.\nHer follow up labs during subsequent clinic visits showed WBC 5.3 K/uL, ANC 3.15 K/uL, Hgb 7.4 g/dL, calculated reticulocyte index of 1.1 and platelets 172 K/uL. Iron was 68 ug/dL, transferrin 124.1 mg/dL, ferritin 2952 ng/mL and serum erythropoietin levels were 31.7 mIU/mL. Serum cobalamin was 394 pg/mL and serum folate 12.3 ng/mL. Since there was spontaneous interval resolution of her neutropenia and her thrombocytopenia our diagnosis at that point was cytopenias secondary to infectious mononucleosis and anemia of chronic kidney disease related to diabetes.\nOur patient presented 7 weeks later at the emergency room with a recurrent febrile syndrome with diffuse cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly (Fig. ) and worsening cytopenias: WBC 1800/uL, ANC 1480/uL, Hgb 8.3 gr/dL, platelet count 20,000/uL; a repeat EBV titer revealed 6580 copies/mL. CT imaging with contrast found bilateral axillary, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Low volume retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly with numerous small ill-defined hypodense lesions was in the spleen and probably also within the liver (Fig. ). At this time a repeat bone marrow biopsy and an excisional lymph node biopsy were performed and reviewed. The bone marrow specimen showed a solitary large cell positive for CD30 identified in the clot. No atypical cells are identified in core biopsy as assessed by IHC for CD30 and Pax-5. EBER was positive in few and scattered cells. The lymph node sections demonstrated near-total effacement of the lymph node architecture by a neoplasm comprised of neoplastic cells with Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg morphology. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD15, CD30, PAX5 (weak), and MUM1. They were negative for CD3, CD20, CD45, ALK, and EMA. The findings were diagnostic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, best subtyped as lymphocyte-depleted. (Fig. ). The expression of PAX5 with weak intensity coupled with MUM1 expression by the neoplastic cells is diagnostic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The expression of PAX5, a gene encoding a B-cell-specific transcription factor, excluded T-cell lymphoma as a diagnostic consideration. It is worth noting also that flow cytometry done on a bone marrow sample with involvement by lymphoma showed no evidence of T-cell or B-cell immunophenotypic aberrancies.\nThe patient was started on ABVD chemotherapy regime, bleomycin was held secondary to patient\u2019s history of cardiomyopathy. She received three cycles of chemotherapy with complete clinical remission. Additional cycles of chemotherapy were not completed given prolonged and severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenias that eventually recovered over the following months. A bone marrow biopsy at completion of treatment revealed no morphologic evidence of residual Hodgkin lymphoma. Her most recent surveillance PET-CT imaging, nine months from completion of treatment, showed no hypermetabolic lymphoma and continuing complete metabolic response to therapy.

    "question": "A 64-year-old man with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and liver failure secondary to hepatitis C, with status post liver transplant 13 years priorly, was brought in by ambulance to the emergency department for acutely altered mental status. The patient had been in his usual state of health, until he told his family 3 hours before that he \u201cfelt sick.\u201d The family incidentally found him on the floor, confused and lethargic, and immediately called the ambulance.\nUpon arrival, the patient had a temperature of 96.4\u00b0F; pulse, 117 beats per minute; blood pressure, 151/93 mmHg; respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation of 100% on nonrebreather. The patient was known to have a history of recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, and his last episode of hepatic encephalopathy was in the prior 3 months, which was treated and controlled with lactulose. The patient's family stated that the patient had run out of lactulose 4 days before presentation. Other than lactulose, the patient was compliant with all of his home medications, including amlodipine, buproprion, cyclosporine, hydrocodone, lasix, methocarbamol, and ramipril. The patient had no known history of seizure, recent illness, brain trauma, or recent surgical procedures.\nPhysical examination showed a male in no acute distress with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 12 (eyes, 4; verbal, 3; motor, 5). There were no signs of trauma found on his body. His pupils were equally round and reactive to light, and his neck was supple and soft with a cervical collar in place. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable except for tachycardia. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Because he was not following commands, the neurologic examination was limited. However, the patient was able to move all extremities equally and pulses were distally equal to all extremities. There was no posturing or clonus noted, and Babinski was downgoing in both feet.\nFingerstick glucose level was 210 mg/dL and bedside hemoglobin level was 13.1 g/dL. Noncontrast head and cervical spine computed tomography revealed no acute pathologic lesion. Chest radiography also showed no acute pathologic lesion. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell counts of 5.5 K/mm3 with 60% neutrophils, hematocrit of 36.5%, and platelets of 115 K/mm3. Electrolyte and liver function results were as follows: sodium, 141 mmol/L; potassium, 3.5 mmol/L; chloride, 104 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 22 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 71 mmol/L; creatinine, 1.9 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 2.1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 128 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 124 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 231 U/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; lipase, 30 U/L; prothrombin time, 14.5 seconds; INR, 1.09; and ammonia, 501 \u03bcmol/L (reference range, 15\u201355 \u03bcmol/L). Toxicology serum screen results were negative for acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol. Urine toxicology screen results were positive only for opiates. Venous blood gas was pH 7.44.\nOwing to the patient's obtunded condition and inability to protect his airway, the patient was electively intubated and given midazolam drip for sedation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring with a presumed diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. While administration of empiric antibiotics was started in the emergency department, it was discontinued after an infectious etiology was deemed unlikely and culture results were negative. Results of a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan were also negative, including no evidence of infarct.\nDuring the ICU stay, the patient was readministered lactulose, and ammonia levels decreased to117 \u03bcmol/L by hospital day 2 and to 78 \u03bcmol/L by hospital day 4. Despite discontinuation of sedation, the patient remained unresponsive. A neurologist was consulted and a bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed findings consistent with status epilepticus. However, the patient had no clinical manifestations of status epilepticus, leading to a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A phenytoin load was immediately administered, while a midazolam infusion was restarted, ultimately leading to EEG resolution of the status epilepticus. The patient did not immediately improve neurologically during the hospitalization stay and was ultimately transferred to another facility for continued treatment and rehabilitation.

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a small amount of ascites and small amount of fluid collection in his bilateral perinephric space. Chest CT showed extensive soft tissue emphysema in his neck and chest wall, extensive mediastinal emphysema, small right pneumothorax, and pericardial fluid (). To rule out esophageal perforation esophagography with gastrographin was performed and it showed no evidence of contrast leakage from his esophagus. The diagnosis of orthorexia nervosa with hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and soft tissue emphysema was made. We started on intravenous fluid supplementation based on treatment of hyponatremia and refeeding syndrome, and oral feeding. He gradually improved, but his total protein and albumin decreased on the 5th hospital day to 4.4 g/dL and 2.5 g/dL, respectively. On the 7th hospital day, his platelet and WBC levels decreased to 27 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L and 1.2 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, respectively.

He denied any chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, profuse sweating, or heat or cold intolerance. He denied a history of smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol. He did endorse a family history of FD in his aunt. Physical examination was remarkable for pale conjunctiva, angiokeratoma of fingertips (Figure ), and asterixis.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis without intravenous contrast (Figure ) showed bilateral renal atrophy, without any evidence of hydronephrosis, pyelonephritis, renal mass, or vascular abnormality. Viral hepatitis panel, HIV panel, and toxicology were negative. The antinuclear antibody (ANA) screen, cytoplasmic and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA and C-ANCA), complement levels, and antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody were all negative. Nephrology service was consulted, and the patient was started on HD due to uremic neuropathy and encephalopathy. Due to the patient\u2019s family history of FD, severe neuropathy, and nephrotic range of proteinuria, the genetic testing, alpha-Gal A activity test, and renal biopsy were performed. The biopsy was limited, with not enough glomeruli for light microscopy (LM) or immunofluorescence microscopy, but electron microscopy (EM) showed numerous electron-dense myelin bodies in the endothelial cell cytoplasm of a glomerular capillary loop, multilamellated myelin bodies (zebra bodies) within the cytoplasm of a tubular epithelial cell, and endothelial cells (Figures , ). Echocardiogram (ECHO) showed mild-to-moderate LVH (Figure ) and mild pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 44 mm/hg with an estimated ejection fraction of 55-60%. Alpha-Gal A activity was significantly reduced, <0.4 nmol/hour/mg protein (reference range: 42.1 to 112.9 nmol/hour/mg protein), which confirm the diagnosis of FD. GAL gene sequencing revealed a novel mutation of c.281G>T; p.Cys94Phe.The patient\u2019s peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy continued to improve on HD, and his blood pressure improved with hydralazine and amlodipine. He was discharged home with continued outpatient HD, with referral to the renal transplant center along with genetic counseling. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 55 year old post menopausal Caucasian female presented with vitiligo on her face, arms and legs. Her past medical history included only mild asthma requiring only intermittent bronchodilators without glucocorticoids. There was no other significant personal or family medical history. Clinical examination showed a well woman, weight of 69.1 kg, height 1.67 metre (body mass index ~25). Her blood pressure was 120/75 lying and 120/70 sitting with a regular pulse of 78 beats per minute. There were 3 vitiligo patches each measuring approximately 3 \u00d7 5 cm on her forehead, anterior abdomen and left cubital fossa. No goitre or liver enlargement was detected. Biochemical investigations are as follow: sodium 130 mmol/L (reference range (RR), 136\u2013146), potassium 5.4 mmol/L (RR, 3.5\u20135.5), chloride 99 mmol/L (RR, 98\u2013108), bicarbonate 21 mmol/L (RR, 24\u201330), urea 9.1 mmol/L (3.0\u20137.0), creatinine 90 umol/L (RR, 40\u201390), bilirubin 18 \u03bcmol/L (6\u201310), alanine aminotransferase 105 IU/L (RR, < 50), aspartate aminotransferase 56 IU/L (RR, < 45), alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L (RR, < 110), \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 40 IU/L (< 60), albumin 33 g/L (RR, 35\u201345), plasma aldosterone 172 pmol/L (RR, 80\u20131040), plasma renin activity > 35.7 ng/mL/hr (RR, 1.2\u20132.8). In essence, they showed mild hyperkalaemic metabolic acidosis and hepatocellular dysfunction. Because the latter persisted, chronic hepatitis C was confirmed with positive serology of genotype 1. The liver biopsy showed changes consistent with chronic persistent hepatitis, the inflammatory and fibrotic changes were both graded 1 according to the scoring method []. Together with additional biochemical and immunological studies, other causes of persistent abnormal liver function tests were excluded. In view of her vitiligo, hepatitis C and biochemical disturbance, the Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test (AST), also known as the Cosyntropin or Short Synacthen test, was performed which revealed the presence of subclinical adrenal insufficiency (AI), additional file . Further investigations for the causes of AI revealed positive adrenal cell antibody (ACA) serology. Computerised tomographic scan showed small adrenal glands bilaterally with normal anatomy and appearance.\nThe patient underwent routine combination treatment of Interferon-\u03b12\u03b2 (IFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) for 48 weeks for her genotype 1 HCV infection. The patient's subclinical adrenal disease was also followed closely using salivary as well as serum cortisol levels to assess the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) every 12 weeks, starting at baseline, during treatment, 6 and 12 month follow-ups. The results suggested a progressive decline of her adrenal function during the treatment phase. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy was seriously considered but with apprehension due to possible exacerbation of the hepatitis. The risks were discussed in detail with the patient and her family and it was decided to continue with anti-viral therapy but without glucocorticoid supplement. The patient and her husband were counselled comprehensively regarding the emergency management of Addisonian crisis, provided with a carrying note and required to wear an alert bracelet. Other immediate family members were also involved in her management plan, with her consent. Her management plan was also forwarded to the local hospital Emergency Department and Hepatitis C Service. Fortunately, there was no crisis other than the common side effects of the treatment regimen. Her pattern of steroid profile and ACA returned to its pre-existing state and remained unchanged at 6 and 12 month follow-up after the cessation of therapy. The patient has remained well since but her subclinical AI persists. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 28-year-old female known case of seizure disorder and depression got admitted to our hospital with a history of consumption of about 80 tablets of amlodipine (5 mg each) at her residence. Patient\u2019s father noticed it initially as she was complaining giddiness and vomiting (30\u201345 minutes later) and immediately she was rushed to the local hospital. Nasogastric tube was placed and stomach wash was given with 50 g of activated charcoal hydrated with adequate intravenous fluids and started on noradrenalin and adrenalin in view of hypotension and later referred to our hospital for further management. Patient came to our hospital 23 hours after consumption of the drug. In the emergency room, the patient was conscious, afebrile, with a pulse rate of 120 beats/minute, blood pressure 88/48 mm Hg, and SpO2 \u221296% (room air). Systemic examination showed bilateral crepitation on auscultation of lungs. Routine blood test showed Hb% 11.3 g/dL, total leukocyte count 9,100, platelet count 1.52 lakh cells/cu mm; serum sodium 132 meq/L, potassium \u22123.8 meq/L, chloride \u2212104 meq/L; serum creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, blood urea: 18 mg/dL, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, SGOT \u221232 U/L, SGPT 28 U/L, serum albumin 3.4 g/L; and arterial blood gas analysis pH: 7.42, pCO2: 28, pO2: 99, and HCO3: 15.6. The 2D transthoracic echocardiography showed global hypokinesia of left ventricle with ejection fraction of 25%, chest X-ray showed bilateral minimal paracardiac haziness (pulmonary edema), and electrocardiograph showed sinus tachycardia. Patient was shifted to ICU for further management. Intravenous glucagon 5 mg bolus was given and another 5 mg repeated after 5 minutes. Insulin-dextrose infusion (0.5 IU/kg/hour) and calcium gluconate infusion (30 mL/hour) was also started. After an hour, her blood pressure dropped to 76/50 mm Hg and she was very drowsy and tachypneic. Doses of noradrenalin and adrenalin were increased and she was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Due to refractory hypotension, VA-ECMO was planned as the rescue therapy. Right femoral vein was cannulated with 25 Fr cannula and placed up to the junction of inferior venacava and right atrium. Left femoral artery was cannulated with 17 Fr cannula and passed up to the abdominal aorta and an additional 7 Fr cannula was used for distal perfusion. Pump flow was maintained at 4.5 L/minute, sweep gas flow of 800 mL/minute, FIO2 of 0.9 and activated clotting time of 180\u2013200 seconds. The ECMO was gradually weaned from 3rd day onward as the blood pressure started improving. Insulin-dextrose and calcium gluconate infusion gradually stopped after 72 hours. Patient was extubated on the 4th day following ECMO decannulation. Patient was shifted to the ward and later discharged home on the 8th day.

    "question": "A 41-year-old man with a history of alcohol intake (90 g ethanol/day for three years) was admitted to Jeju Hospital in June 2004 due to a traffic accident in which he sustained a right distal radius fracture. During the hospital stay, he developed jaundice and was diagnosed with an aneurysm of the distal descending thoracic aorta. He was then transferred to Yonsei Medical Center, where he received further treatment.\nThe physical examination upon admission revealed the following vital signs: blood pressure 160/110 mmHg, pulse rate 85 beats/minute, respiration rate 18 breaths/minute, and body temperature 36.7\u2103. There was a slight hepatosplenomegaly without evidence of other abdominal masses. Laboratory tests revealed the following: hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL, hematocrit 38.7%, white blood cell count 5,720/\u00b5L with 59.4% polymorphonuclear cell, platelet count 97,000/\u00b5L, sodium 136.5 mEq/L, potassium 3.97 mEq/L, chloride 96.7 mEq/L, bicarbonate 23.9 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 6.5 mg/dL, creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, total protein 8.8 g/dL, albumin 3.7 g/dL, total bilirubin 2.6 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 159 IU/L, AST 82 IU/L, ALT 27 IU/L, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 605 IU/L, prothrombin time 70%, c-reactive protein 1.61 mg/dL, HBsAg negative, anti-HBs negative, anti-HBc negative, anti-HCV negative, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 7.52 ng/mL, and protein induced by vitamin K absence II 158 mAU/mL.\nOn the first day of hospitalization, a computerized tomography (CT) of the aorta and a dynamic CT of the liver were taken. The CT of the aorta showed a fusiform shaped aneurysm at the distal descending thoracic aorta measuring 4 cm at the maximal diameter, with circumferential calcification of the aneurysm wall. The CT also revealed surface nodularity of the liver, suggesting liver cirrhosis, and numerous small nodules throughout the entire liver. The dynamic liver CT showed multiple nodular lesions with arterial enhancement and delayed washout in both lobes of the liver (). On the fifth day, a US-guided liver gun biopsy was performed on a 2.5 cm-sized hyperechoic nodule with a peripheral halo in the right lobe of the liver (). The liver biopsy showed a hepatocellular nodule with slightly increased cellularity, fatty change, and Mallory bodies (). It also showed unpaired arteries and focal sinusoidal expression of CD34, indicating increased angiogenesis in the nodule; however, both the structural and cytological atypia were unremarkable and there was focal iron deposition. The background revealed alcoholic micronodular cirrhosis. From these observations, the lesion was tentatively diagnosed as a hypervascular hyperplastic nodule in alcoholic cirrhosis. On the twelfth day, a percutaneous transarterial angiography with stent insertion at the aortic aneurysm was performed. Two days later, an aortic CT demonstrated the complete exclusion of the aneurysm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver was performed on the fifteenth day revealed underlying liver cirrhosis and numerous nodules that showed high signals on T1 weighted images, but there were some with a central low signal portion (). Among those, arterial phase enhancing nodules were present, suggesting overt HCCs. Other nodules also showed central enhancement patterns, suggesting dysplastic nodules with subfocus HCCs (). On the nineteenth day, a second liver gun biopsy was performed on the same lesion as the first biopsy and demonstrated the same pathological features. From these findings, the possibility of mistargeting the biopsy was ruled out and the diagnosis of hypervascular hyperplastic nodules in alcoholic cirrhosis was confirmed. Hepatic angiography performed on the twenty-fourth day showed faint multiple nodular staining of both liver lobes in the early arterial phase (). The patient was discharged three days after the hepatic angiography and scheduled for an outpatient follow-up. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 27-year-old man with no medical history presented with headache since the morning and increasing nausea and drowsiness during the day. He became progressively confused in the late afternoon after which his partner consulted a doctor. On arrival at the emergency department he had an epileptic seizure with spontaneous recovery. Neurological and physical examination were unremarkable. Clinically he was euvolemic. CT head showed diffuse sulcal effacement without signs of haemorrhage, basilar artery thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or an intracranial tumour. Venous blood gas analysis, taken minutes after the seizure, showed a pH of 6.89, Pco2 10.8 kPa, bicarbonate 15.4 mmol/L, base excess \u221219.4 mmol/L and a lactate of 18.0 mmol/L. Blood chemistry was remarkable for sodium 131 mmol/L, chloride 82 mmol/L, albumin 51 g/L and an osmolality of 278 mOsmol/kg. The urine toxicology test was positive for acetaminophen but negative for opiates, amphetamines and cocaine. He was then treated with ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, acyclovir and dexamethasone awaiting the results of the lumbar puncture but the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was normal.\nThis prompted us to reconsider the laboratory results. Patients relatively high haematocrit (0.48 L/L), together with the increased albumin level, were suggestive for haemoconcentration. However, we realised that measurements were done in a venous blood sample, which may have been \u2018haemoconcentrated\u2019 by water influx into the muscles during rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, we suggested that his arterial sodium concentration could well be lower, possibly low enough to explain the seizure. And indeed, in an arterial blood gas analysis taken 45 min after the seizure, the plasma sodium level was 118 mmol/L. Analysis of this hyponatremia revealed a urine sodium level of <20 mmol/L and an osmolality of 92 mOsmol/kg. He was diagnosed with primary polydipsia (the polyuria explaining the relatively low urine sodium concentration) and was admitted to the intensive care unit. In the first hours after admission his urine production was over 1 L/hour and the plasma sodium level rapidly increased to 128 mmol/L.\nAfter regaining consciousness he told he had been drinking an excessive amount of water extra throughout the day (4\u20135 L) because he thought that his headache was caused by dehydration. He further explained that he was living a healthy lifestyle in which drinking ample amounts of water played a central role. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?",

Comorbidities included hypertension, active smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Patient denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, or any shortness of breath. He had a recent admission due to community acquired pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics. He denied using any illicit drugs or alcohol abuse. He was retired truck driver by profession.\nOn examination, he was an elderly man with clinical signs of dehydration. Blood pressure was 155/56 mm Hg, heart rate was 67/min, respiratory rate was 16/min, was afebrile, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He had mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rigidity. He had bilateral lower extremities chronic skin changes with scaling. The rest of the physical examination was normal.\nSignificant laboratory data revealed serum sodium 124 mEq/mL, potassium 5.1 mEq/mL, chloride 89 mEq/mL, bicarbonate 15 mEq/mL, blood urea nitrogen 44 mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, glucose 85 mg/dL, calcium 10.3 mg/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, and albumin 2.9 g/dL.

Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 25 mm Hg, pO2 of 90.3 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. There was an anion gap of 20, lactic acid of 4.8 mmoles/L, serum lipase of 1540 U/L, amylase 406 unit/L, gamma GT 25 unit/L, INR 1.3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 950 unit/L; cancer antigen CA 19-9 was 49.9 \u03bc/mL, TSH was 2.25 mIU/L, serum acetone was negative, and alcohol level was less than 10 mg/dL. His serial cardiac enzymes were negative and he was ruled out for an acute coronary event.\nChest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral patchy airspace disease. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with homogeneous attenuation and without significant peripancreatic inflammation () with extensive retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy (). A para-aortic lymph node measuring 2.1 cm and retrocaval lymph node measuring 1.6 cm were seen. A soft tissue density surrounding the right common iliac vessels likely representing confluent adenopathy was seen. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 67%; right ventricle systolic pressure was estimated to be 44 mm Hg. Pericardium was normal without any pericardial effusion. There was no significant valvular abnormality.\nInitially, the patients EKG showed 2nd degree Mobitz type I block which later progressed to complete heart block. Patient was given atropine without improvement; hence, a temporary pacemaker was inserted. He was started on IV hydration and IV antibiotics and all his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. His temporary pacemaker lead came out and it was removed. Subsequently he became unresponsive, was orally intubated, had four cardiac arrests, and was successfully resuscitated. Due to persistent pulmonary infiltrates he underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies which showed evidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). He was started on Bactrim for the treatment of PJP. He tested positive for HIV and was found to have a CD 4 count of 12/uL.\nA temporary pacemaker wire was again placed after ruling out the relevant reversible causes of third degree heart block. A repeat echocardiogram was unchanged from prior one. CT-guided biopsy of the para-aortic lymph nodes was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with marked tumor necrosis (). Immunoprofile showed that CD 20 (), CD 79a, and CD 10 were positive. CD 43, CD 3, CD 7, and BcL were negative. Upper endoscopy for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement showed gastric polyps which revealed gastric lymphoma on biopsy.\nPatient was not a candidate for chemotherapy or ART due to critical condition.

    "question": "A 23-yr-old woman with type 2 DM and Graves' disease has revisited to the Department of Emergency of Gyeongsang National University Hospital due to nausea, generalized weakness, polyuria and weight loss of 5 kg for 7 days in October 2003 since she was discharged from our hospital three weeks before. She was previously diagnosed as type 2 DM in 1996, and recently started insulin treatment to improve glycemic control due to persistently elevated HbA1c irrespective of oral administration of hypoglycemic agents. Three years before, she had taken propylthiouracil for hyperthyroid Graves' disease for 2 yr. In May 2003, she was diagnosed as relapse of hyperthyroidism at a local clinic and referred to our hospital for management of thyrotoxicosis refractory to usual dosage of propylthiouracil, 300 mg/day and proliferative diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. She had 7.9 mM/L fasting blood glucose, 1.07 nM/L C-peptide (reference range [RR], 0.1-0.83), 222 mM/L fructosamine (RR, 205-285), 8.3% HbA1c (RR, 4.5-5.6) and 0.01 mU/L TSH and 2.02 pM/L free T3 on thryoid function tests. At that time, Her weight was 54 kg and height was 147 cm (body mass index, 25.0 kg/m2). Her thyroid had the volume of about 40 g and it looked diffusely enlarged and rubbery consistency on palpation. The technetium-99m (Tc-99m) thyroid scan revealed marginally increased and somewhat irregular uptake (3.8%). As from hospitalization, the patient had oral administration of relatively high dose of methimazole (60 mg daily), propranolol (160 mg daily) and 12 drops of Lugol's solution (three times a day) for 14 days, and consecutively lithium carbonate (900 mg daily) for 14 days because of persisting tachycardia (>110/ min), dyspnea on exertion and still high concentration of free T3 (4.44 pM/L). She was discharged with receiving methimazole (60 mg daily) and beta-blocker ().\nShe had no family history of thyroid disease, but both parents have been suffering from type 2 DM. She denied ingestion of any drugs including alcohol or excessive consumption of fizzy drinks these days. She also has been adhering to administration of antithyroid drug, beta-blocker and insulin (0.5 units/kg/day) since being discharged. On physical examination, the patient had 143/89 mmHg blood pressure, 36.8\u2103 body temperature, 22/min respiration rate, and 121/min pulse rate. She looked acutely ill, and had slightly tremulous, warmhands, and decreased skin turgor and dried tongue. She was 48 kg weight and body mass index 22.2 kg/m2. Exophthalmos was not present. The abdomen was soft and flat, and liver and spleen were not palpable.\nOn admission, her laboratory findings were as follows; hemoglobin 12.3 g/dL, WBC 8.65\u00d7109/L (segmented neutrophil 58%, lymphocyte 29%), platelet 398\u00d7109/L, total protein 65 g/L, albumin 32 g/L, ALP 3.47 ukat/L, AST 0.42 ukat/L, ALT 0.6 ukat/L, BUN 9.2 mM/L and creatinine 88.7 \u00b5M/L. Levels of blood glucose (32.7 mM/L) and fructosamine (396 mM/L) were elevated. Her serum electrolytes and blood gas parameters were as follows: sodium 144.1 mM/L, potassium 5.4 mM/L, chloride 102 mM/L, calcium 2.5 mM/L, phosphorus 1.0 mM/L, pH 7.32, pCO2 35 mmHg, pO2 98 mmHg, and bicarbonate 16 mM/L. The fasting serum C-peptide was 0.44 nM/L. Serum anion gap was 20.9 and osmolarity was calculated as 321 mosm/kg. Amylase and lipase levels were normal and anti-GAD antibody was negative. Thyroid function tests revealed that the patient had more aggravated hyperthyroid state; 0.01 mU/L TSH, 2.78 pM/L free T3 and 45.38 pM/L free T4 (RR, 11.41-23.08) than when she was hospitalized two weeks before (0.12 mU/L TSH, 1.41 pM/L free T3 and 30.26 pM/L free T4). TSH-receptor antibody level was 26.3 IU/L (RR, <1) and antimicrosomal antibody was 29.3 U/mL (RR, <60). The Tc-99m scan showed still enlarged thyroid with more increased uptake 6.5% than previous uptake scan (3.8%) performed taking propylthiouracil two months before. Based on above results, the patient was diagnosed as HHS accompanying mild ketosis on type 2 DM and aggravated Graves' hyperthyroidism. We treated her with intravenous insulin injection and large volume of intravenous fluid administration. And also, she took high dose of methimazole (90 mg daily, six times a day) and beta-blockers. On the second day, nausea and generalized weakness have been improved.\nAt two months after acute presentation, we measured levels of C-peptide after 75 g glucose loading; 0 min (0.12 nM/L), 30 min (0.74 nM/L), 60 min (1.02 nM/L), 90 min (1.49 nM/L) and 120 min (1.32 nML). Throughout follow-ups for 2 months, she took insulin (0.9 units/kg/day), metformin (1,500 mg daily) and methimazole (45 mg daily). The mean fasting capillary blood glucose level on self monitoring was rather elevated than the target, but free T3 level became normalized ().

    "question": "A 49-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with a 3-month history of general weakness and anorexia. The patient had been treated for stage 5 CKD secondary to diabetic nephropathy at the nephrology division for the last 3 years. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was 57.2 mg/dL and creatinine (Cr) level was 6 mg/dL at 3 months before admission, and he reported worsening of uremic symptoms, such as malaise, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. After his diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus 20 years before admission, the patient was on combination therapy including oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin. He had no past history of pulmonary TB and viral hepatitis. At the time of admission, his blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and body temperature (BT) were 109/53 mm Hg, 80 beats/min, 20 breaths/min, and 37.3 \u00b0C, respectively. His consciousness was clear, and no murmur or crackles were detected on chest auscultation, although both conjunctivae were pale. No signs of a mass, organomegaly, and nearby tenderness were observed on the abdominal examination. A peripheral blood test on admission revealed the following: white blood cell (WBC) count, 7000/\u03bcL (neutrophils, 72%); hemoglobin, 5.2 g/dL; platelets, 374,000/\u03bcL; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 44 mm/h. Serum biochemical examination revealed the following: glucose, 267 mg/dL; total protein, 6.2 g/dL; albumin, 2.6 g/dL; BUN, 96.9 mg/dL; Cr, 8.1 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 8 mL/min); aspartate aminotransferase, 7 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 18 IU/L; Na+/K+/Cl\u2212/total CO2, 130/6.0/100/14 mEq/L; calcium, 7.6 mg/dL; phosphorus, 6.2 mg/dL; uric acid, 13.4 mg/dL; and C-reactive protein, 14.6 mg/L. On urinalysis, 2+ was observed for albumin and 1+ for occult blood, and microscopic urinary sediment evaluation revealed 1 to 3 WBCs per high-power field (HPF) and 3 to 5 red blood cells per HPF. Serum immunological tests showed the following: iron, 14 \u03bcg/dL; total iron binding capacity, 199 \u03bcg/dL; ferritin, 172 ng/mL; and HbA1C, 8%. A 24-h urine examination revealed a urinary protein excretion level of 1156 mg/day and Cr clearance of 8.8 mL/min/1.73 m2. The patient's chest radiograph did not reveal pulmonary infiltrates in either lung field. On admission, hemodialysis was initiated after insertion of a dual-lumen temporary catheter for suspected exacerbation of uremia. Regular hemodialysis was conducted three times a week, and an autologous arteriovenous fistula was created on the 10th hospital day. During hemodialysis on the 14th day of hospitalization, high fever with a BT of 38.3\u00b0C was noted. With suspicion of catheter-related infection, we exchanged the catheter used for vascular access for hemodialysis and administered cefazolin (2.0 g, three times per week) after each hemodialysis. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from blood cultures. On the 25th day of hospitalization, the patient presented with intermittent low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Clostridium difficile toxins in stool specimens detected the toxin B-positive strain. On the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis (PMC), we discontinued the administration of cefazolin and administered oral metronidazole (1500 mg/day). However, the patient's abdominal discomfort, fever (BT, 37.5\u201338.3\u00b0C), and night sweats persisted. Because the origin of fever was not clear, abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed on the 28th hospital day revealed masses with irregular walls in the proximal portion of the ascending colon near the ileocecal valve and adjacent lymphadenopathy (Fig. A); an increase in 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake was also noted in the corresponding region on whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan (Fig. ). The radiologic diagnosis was colon cancer with lymph node metastases. Colonoscopy with biopsy for histopathologic diagnosis was performed. A fungating circumferential mass with hypertrophic ulcerations, which mimicked a colonic tumor, was found in the ascending colon (Fig. A). However, microscopic examination demonstrated chronic caseating granulomatous inflammation and positive Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacillus (AFB), consistent with colonic TB (Fig. A and B). PCR analysis of the colonic lesions was negative for M. tuberculosis. The patient's tuberculin skin test (TST) result was also negative, and tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were all normal. We recommended surgical intervention including hemi-colectomy in view of the morphologic characteristics of the colonic lesions, but the patient refused surgery. Accordingly, we initiated quadruple therapy (HRZE): isoniazid (INH; 300 mg/day), rifampicin (RIF; 600 mg/day), pyrazinamide (PZA; 30 mg/kg, three times per week), and ethambutol (EMB; 15 mg/kg, three times per week). The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 45th day of admission after complete resolution of systemic symptoms. Anti-TB quadruple therapy was applied for the first 2 months; thereafter, it was switched to dual combination therapy (HR) of INH and RIF. Three months after the administration of anti-TB medications, follow-up colonoscopy showed improvement in colonic lesions. However, 9 months after the initiation of quadruple therapy, a second follow-up abdominal CT and colonoscopy showed polypoid residual lesions in the ascending colon (Figs. B and 3B) and we conducted laparoscopy-assisted ileocecal resection. Anti-TB chemotherapy was maintained for a total of 12 months. Progression of lymphadenopathy in the abdominal cavity or recurrence of colonic TB was not noted on follow-up abdominal CT performed at 6 months after discontinuation of anti-TB medications.

He visited a primary clinic, where his blood pressure was 70/50 mmHg. Laboratory findings showed azotemia and leukocytosis, and he was referred to the emergency department of our hospital. His wife also experienced nausea and vomiting that resolved spontaneously. He had a history of cigarette smoking (35 packs/yr). His medical history was insignificant, and he had not been on any medication (including over-the-counter medication) and was denied contact with any sick persons, use of illicit drugs, exposure to animals, and recent travel outside Seoul.\nOn admission, his blood pressure was 106/51 mm Hg, heart rate was 115 beats/min, respiratory rate was 24/min, and body temperature was 37.1\u2103. He looked acutely ill but was mentally alert. Laboratory tests revealed the following: white blood cell (WBC) count, 34,670/\u00b5L (absolute neutrophil count [ANC], 32,243/\u00b5L); hemoglobin (Hb), 17.0 g/dL; platelet count, 322,000/\u00b5L; blood urea nitrogen, 47.9 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 1.6 mg/dL (reference, 0.6-1.1 mg/dL); total protein, 6.2 g/dL; albumin, 3.7 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 34 IU/L (reference, 5-40 IU/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 19 IU/L (reference, 5-40 IU/L); lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), 313 IU/L (reference, 145-250 IU/L); creatine kinase (CK), 213 IU/L (reference, 38-160 IU/L); serum Na/K/Cl, 140/4.9/108 mEq/L; total CO2, 17.1 mmol/L; serum glucose, 180 mg/dL; HbA1c, 7.3%; C-reactive protein (CRP), 159 mg/dL (reference, 0.0-8.0 mg/dL); and prothrombin time (PT) international normalized ratio (INR), 1.24. After receiving 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal prongs, blood gas analysis revealed the following: pH, 7.351; PCO2, 30.1 mmHg; PO2, 65.4 mmHg; HCO3, 18.2 mmol/L; and SaO2, 91.8%. Chest radiography showed slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle (). Urinalysis revealed no proteinuria or hematuria. After admission, he received a large amount of fluid (9 L over 24 hours), and his clinical condition improved as vomiting and diarrhea had subsided until day 3 of hospitalization.\nOn day 4, he developed sudden shortness of breath, coughing, and severe respiratory distress. His laboratory examinations were more aggravated as follows: WBC count, 2,840/\u00b5L (ANC 2,720/\u00b5L); platelet count, 57,000/L; PT INR, 1.16; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 38.0 seconds; fibrin degradation product >20 \u00b5g/mL (reference, 0.0-5.0 \u00b5g/mL); plasma D-dimer, 6.56 \u00b5g/mL (reference, 0.0-0.5 \u00b5g/mL); CRP, 185 mg/L; AST, 82 IU/L; ALT, 50 IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; and serum creatinine, 1.6 mg/dL. Chest radiography revealed new widespread consolidations in the whole left lung (). A subsequent computed tomographic (CT)-scan showed extensive consolidations in the left lung and multiple consolidations from the sublobular to subsegmental areas in the right lung, as well as a small amount of pleural effusion in both lungs (). However, the CT scan did not show any intra-abdominal infection foci or abnormal findings to explain the severe pneumonia sepsis. Bronchoscopy showed no evidence of endobronchial lesions. He received mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) owing to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, a PaO2/FiO2<200 mm Hg, and acute oliguric kidney failure. However, he developed refractory shock and his condition rapidly deteriorated. We suspected a possible fulminant course of necrotizing pneumonia and considered surgical intervention and thus consulted the thoracic department. He underwent left pneumonectomy because the gross appearance of the lung inflammation suggested impending pulmonary gangrene. Skin lesions such as miliaria, bullae, and erythroderma were found on the chest wall, face, and upper extremities (not shown). Lung histology revealed varying stages of inflammation with areas of extensive hemorrhagic necrosis (), massive inflammatory cell infiltration and edema in the alveolar space and interstitium (), type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and prominent proliferation of young fibroblasts (), and the formation of a hyaline membrane along the alveolar wall ().\nHe subsequently suffered from rhabdomyolysis, kidney failure, hepatic failure, pancytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and prolonged shock. On day 7, his body temperature was 39.4\u2103, and his laboratory examinations were more aggravated as follows: WBC count, 120/\u00b5L (ANC, 80/\u00b5L); platelet count, 32,000/\u00b5L; PT INR, 1.50; aPTT, 41.7 seconds; fibrin degradation product>20 \u00b5g/mL (reference, 0.0-5.0 \u00b5g/mL); plasma D-dimer, 4.95 \u00b5g/mL (reference, 0.0-0.5 \u00b5g/mL); CRP, 250 mg/L; AST, 122 IU/L; ALT, 54 IU/L; total bilirubin, 5.0 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 2.0 mg/dL; LDH, 500 IU/L; CK, 4,997 IU/L; and serum myoglobin>1,000 ng/mL (reference, 10-92 ng/mL). A peripheral blood smear showed severe pancytopenia mimicking aplastic anemia. Treatment comprising fluid resuscitation with crystalloid and inotropics was performed. Although causative infectious pathogens were not identified from bronchial washing or blood and lung tissues, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenem, vancomycin, and respiratory quinolone were administrated. Despite the administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), transfusion of platelet concentrates and packed red blood cells, high doses of inotropics (including norepinephrine, dopamine, and dobutamine), as well as lung protective ventilation strategy and CRRT, he did not recover from multiorgan failure and died on day 13 of hospitalization.\nThe wild mushroom specimen in question was sent to a team of expert mycologists, at the National Academy of Agricultural Science in Korea, were it was determined to be P. cornu-damae ().

    "question": "A 29-year-old man presented at a emergency room in a stupor.\nThe patient had started psychiatric treatment after being diagnosed with personality disorder and hypochondriasis by the department of psychiatry in our hospital 4 years ago. After about 1 year of treatment, olanzapine was administered due to the patient's symptoms of social withdrawal and distrust of people. After the initiation of olanzapine, the patient's body weight increased by \u226530 kg, and hyperthermia occurred together with nausea and vomiting 1 week prior to the visit to our hospital. The patient received a prescription from a neighboring hospital and had taken antipyretics, but did not show any improvement. Then the patient showed mental deterioration and was admitted to our hospital via the emergency room.\nBoth parents were moderately built, and none of the family members, including siblings, had a metabolic disease such as diabetes.\nThe patient was on medication due to incidences of personality disorder, hypochondriasis, and psychotic tendency, taking olanzapine 10 mg, valproic acid 500 mg, clonazepam 0.5 mg, and lorazepam 1 mg on a daily basis. The aforementioned medication regimen was maintained for over 1 year without any dosage change, and the intake period of olanzapine was 32 months. There was no other underlying disease than the aforementioned, and there were no abnormal test results based on blood assay, including an assay for fasting plasma glucose, which was performed prior to administration of antipsychotics.\nThe patient had no history of smoking or alcohol drinking and was unemployed since completion of military service as social service personnel.\nIn physical examination, the patient showed acute signs of illness and was in a coma. His vital signs measured at the time of visit to our hospital were 110/70 mm Hg for blood pressure (BP), 120 beats per minute for pulse rate, 24 times per minute for respiratory rate, and 37.2\u2103 for body temperature. The patient's height was 181 cm, weight was 104 kg and body mass index (BMI) was 31.7 kg/m2. His consciousness state was stupor with normal light reflexes, and senses as well as spontaneous motions of extremities were maintained. Chest auscultation revealed that the heart rate was fast, but there was no murmur, and the patient had tachypnea, but had no crackles or wheezing sound auscultated. There was neither notable tenderness nor rebound tenderness from the abdomen. The patient's skin was dry overall.\nPeripheral blood assay showed the following results: white blood cell 6,560/mm3 (neutrophil 72%), hemoglobin 20.2 g/dL, hematocrit 60.8%, and platelets 228,000/mm3. Taking the findings of physical examination into account, dehydration-induced hemoconcentration was suspected. The results of serum biochemical assay revealed that the plasma glucose level had increased to 1,216 mg/dL, the blood urea nitrogen level was 31 mg/dL, and creatinine level was 2.4 mg/dL. The result also showed the following: sodium, 149 mEq/L; potassium, 4.5 mEq/L; chloride, 96 mEq/L; total protein, 8.7 g/dL; albumin, 5.0 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 28 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 44 IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; calcium, 11.5 mg/dL; phosphate, 6.1 mg/dL; and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), 80 U/L (reference range, 30 to 170). Dipstick-utilized urine assay showed a positive reaction to ketone, and increases in amylase and lipase to 545 IU/L (reference range, 28 to 100) and 1,435 U/L (reference range, 13 to 60), respectively. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed that the pH was 7.25, pCO2 was 18.9 mm Hg, pO2 was 86.1 mm Hg, HCO3- was 8.2 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation was 95.7%, presenting metabolic acidosis with 44.8 mEq/L of anion gap. The glycosylated hemoglobin level was 13.8%, while the serum C-peptide level tested during the administration of insulin were 0.38 ng/mL. So the patient was presumed to be in DKA and acute renal failure.\nElectrocardiography findings showed sinus tachycardia with rate of 150 beats per minute.\nThere were no specific findings from the chest X-ray examination, and there was no evidence of ileus other than fecal impaction shown on abdominal X-ray examination. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed no findings of edema or necrosis or fluid retention in the pancreatic parenchyme and its periphery ().\nAlthough there was no sign of BP reduction, the patient showed severe dehydration induced by extreme hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. We administered \u22654 L per day of fluid through intravenous infusion and immediately began insulin pump therapy. Within 24 hours of insulin therapy, the plasma glucose level was reduced to less than 300 mg/dL (), the anion gap level was reduced to normal range and ABGA showed that the patient was out of metabolic acidosis. But, in spite of fluid infusion of \u22652 L per day, hyperthermia occurred and the levels of CPK and creatinine began to increase rapidly to 16,161 U/L and 4.1 mg/dL, respectively, on the 3rd day of hospitalization. Also, the urinary myoglobin level was 1,879 ng/mL. In addition, the patient was in a confused mental state with severe muscle stiffness and rigidity, and increased uptake at upper and lower proximal limb was shown on bone scan (). Even with fluid treatment for acute renal failure, the level of creatinine continued to increase, so we started continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on the 5th day of hospitalization (). After initiation of CRRT, the patient showed remarkable improvement in fever and consciousness, so we converted dialysis modality to intermittent hemodialysis 3 days later and maintained the treatment until the 12th day of hospitalization. The urine output was normalized and there was no additional elevation in creatinine and CPK concentrations, so we discontinued hemodialysis (). The patient presented consciousness deterioration, muscle stiffness, and high fever that did not respond to antipyretics and fluid infusion with history of taking antipsychotics, so we determined that the patient had NMS, and implemented supportive therapy including discontinuation of causative medication. We used the insulin pump for glycemic control in the early stage, and changed to multiple daily injections of insulin to manage the patient's condition. We could discontinue the administration of insulin on the 41st day after the first visit to our hospital as the insulin demand had gradually decreased. And we changed to metformin monotherapy. We stopped the administration of oral hypoglycemic agents on the 52nd day. On follow-up examination, we confirmed a notable reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin and a remarkable restoration of the serum C-peptide level (). Currently, the patient is maintaining very good glycemic control only by life style modification and is under prognostic observation as an outpatient.

    "question": "A previously healthy, 39-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with generalized edema lasting 1 month and with sudden-onset pain in her right lower leg, particularly when walking. On admission, her general appearance was acutely ill and generally edematous. A physical examination revealed that her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, her heart rate was 90/min, her respiratory rate was 22/min, and her body temperature was 36.5\u2103. Her breathing sounds were clear, and her heartbeat was regular without murmur. A subsequent examination of her lower limbs showed asymmetric bilateral pretibial pitting edema predominantly in the left lower limb. In contrast, the right lower limb was less edematous and had very weak popliteal and pedal pulses. Delayed capillary refilling was also found in the right toes. The Homan's sign was negative.\nSerum laboratory findings at admission were as follows: white blood cell count of 5,300/mm3, hematocrit of 39.5% with hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dl, and platelet count of 286,000/mm3. The serum sodium concentration was 141 mEq/L, the potassium concentration was 4.1 mEq/L, the chloride concentration was 104 mEq/L, and total CO2 was 28 mEq/L. The blood urea nitrogen concentration was 12.1 mg/dl, the creatinine concentration was 0.86 mg/dl, the serum total protein concentration was 4.3 g/dl, the albumin concentration was 2.2 g/dl, the total cholesterol concentration was 349.4 mg/dl, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 214.4 mg/dl, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 111 mg/dl, and the triglyceride concentration was 120.1 mg/dl. The results of liver function tests were normal. The coagulation profile showed an activated partial thromboplastin time of 32.0 s, prothrombin time of 9.7 s, anti-thrombin III value of 82% (70-120%), protein C activity of 143% (70-130%), and protein S activity of 65% (58.7-119.2%). The anti-nuclear antibody titer was less than 1:40, the anti-double-stranded DNA titer was 30.9 IU/ml, the C3 level was 158 mg/dl, and the C4 level was 19 mg/dl. Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G, anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin M, and lupus anticoagulant were all negative. Urinalysis revealed 3+ proteinuria (spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 10.9 g/g creatinine; spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 7,406.2 mg/g creatinine) and trace hematuria (1-3 red blood cells/high-power field). To investigate the etiology of nephrotic syndrome, an urgent renal biopsy was performed.\nThereafter, although she had no risk factors for thrombosis such as immobilization, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, or a recent orthopedic or gynecologic surgery, to rule out arterial thrombosis of the right lower extremity, lower extremity computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. The CT imaging revealed that the right superficial femoral artery was occluded and there was no identifiable proximal source of thromboembolism in other large arteries (). On the basis of these CT angiographic findings, right lower extremity angiography was performed, which revealed a total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (). For the treatment of this condition, balloon dilatation was initially tried at the distal superficial femoral artery but failed. Hence, thrombectomy was performed with the Fogarty balloon catheter and the thrombi were successfully aspirated. After the interventional treatment, a good distal arterial flow was reestablished (). Thereafter, warfarin (5 mg/day) as an anticoagulant and corticosteroid treatments were initiated.\nSubsequent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic studies showed no evidence of intracardiac thrombus, vegetation, or other structural abnormalities including patent foramen ovale. Quantitation of proteinuria was confirmed by using a 24-hour urine collection that showed 10.2 g/day of protein excretion and 7.8 g/day of albumin excretion, respectively. Afterwards, with administration of warfarin and corticosteroid, the patient had nearly completely recovered from the edema and claudication and was discharged. The renal pathologic results were consistent with minimal change disease ( and ). Two months after discharge, her urine protein-to-creatinine ratio decreased to less than 0.1 g/g creatinine, her serum albumin level was maintained at 4.1 g/dl, and she had no further symptoms or signs of arterial thrombosis.

    "question": "A 63-year-old woman working in a koji brewery presented to our hospital with a prolonged cough for 20 years but that had been increasing since 2015. In March 2016, she developed dyspnea on effort, and she presented to our hospital in June 2016. She had no past histories including allergic disorders and did not smoke or drink alcohol. She had not experienced episodic wheezes or rhonchi. She had been working as a koji brewer in a factory of her family's koji-brewing business for 30 years.\nOn presentation, mild fine crackles were heard, and her respiratory rate was 17 per minute. Body temperature was 36.2\u00b0C. Results of pulmonary function tests including vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), and FEV1/forced vital capacity were within normal range. The FEV1 did not change by bronchodilator inhalation. Her diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide was not measured. Blood gas analysis under ambient air showed a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 39.5 Torr, PaO2 of 79.4 Torr, and HCO3- of 25.2 mmol/L. Laboratory test results were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC), 4000/mm3; hemoglobin, 12.5 g/dL; platelets, 22.4 \u00d7 104/mm3; serum total protein, 7.5 g/dL; albumin, 4.2 g/dL; creatinine, 0.6 mg/dL; Na, 141 mmol/L; Cl, 104 mmol/L; K, 4.2 mmol/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 234 IU/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 0.1 mg/dL; KL-6, 316 U/mL; IgE, 385 IU/mL; \u03b2-D-glucan, 30.5 pg/mL (normal range <11 pg/mL); and Aspergillus antigen (galactomannan antigen), 6.4. Serum anti-Trichosporon asahii antibody, IgA antibodies against Mycobacterium avium, and interferon-gamma releasing assay were all negative. Chest X-ray (Fig. A) showed no abnormal shadows, but computed tomography (Fig. B) showed ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules in both upper lobes.\nBronchoalveolar lavage could not recover a sufficient amount of saline, and transbronchial lung biopsy showed alveolitis without granuloma formation. A. oryzae was cultured from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum precipitating antibody against A. oryzae was positive. A. oryzae was repeatedly isolated from her factory. After admission, her symptoms improved, and her PaO2 under ambient air improved to 97.5 Torr, although pulmonary function tests remained unchanged. The ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules on computed tomography (CT) improved (Fig. C), and her serum \u03b2-D-glucan value decreased to <11 pg/mL. Thereafter, she returned to her factory, after which her cough relapsed, her PaO2 decreased to 79.7 Torr, and she redeveloped centrilobular nodules on chest CT (Fig. D). Although her WBC counts and serum CRP values did not worsen, we diagnosed her as having HP due to A. oryzae. Her serum \u03b2-D-glucan value was elevated to 28.8 pg/mL. She has stopped working at the factory, but her family has continued to brew koji. She continues to be followed on an outpatient basis, and her HP has not relapsed.

    "question": "A 53-year-old obese male presented due to a wound in his right thigh. He stated that the wound started as an itch and that it progressed to its current state in just 5 days. The wound started to smell bad. The patient had a history of diabetes, which he reports to be diet controlled. He is a truck driver by trade and says he does his best to do a good job with his diet. His past medical history was notable for testicular cancer status after radiation 9 years earlier. He states that his left groin skin has always been a little sensitive after the radiation and in that he often will itch it. He says this wound started out as an itch as well. Intense itching led to an open wound, at which point he applied povidone iodine and put a dressing on it. He was remarkably stoic, considering the extent of the wound.\nReview of systems is negative except as noted above. The patient specifically denied fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary symptoms, or headache. His prescribed medications included atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, Diltiazem and Lisinopril for hypertension, Metformin for diabetes, and Gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy. The patient had no allergies and his tetanus status was up to date.\nPatient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 145/85 mmHg; respiratory rate 20/min; pulse 91/min, SpO2 99%, temperature 36.7\u00b0C; and pain 8/10. On physical exam, he was alert and oriented to person, time, and place and in no acute distress. Pertinent positive findings included a 4 cm \u00d7 10 cm elliptical wound on the left thigh with necrotic flesh within, which was exquisitely foul smelling (). The left leg appeared somewhat mottled and cellulitic compared to right leg. Both legs had intact dorsalis pedis and popliteal pulses.\nLaboratory analysis revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.1 k/cm with the remainder of the CBC within normal limits. The metabolic panel revealed blood sugar of 398 and corresponding hyponatremia of 128 mmol/L. The chloride and bicarbonate were also low at 89 mmol/L and 21 mmol/L, respectively, yielding an elevated anion gap of 18. The patient also has had hypoalbuminemia with a value of 2.5 g/dL. Lactate was elevated at 2.8 mmol/L. Coagulation studies were within normal limits. Blood cultures were sent. The urinalysis demonstrated clear glycosuria with >500 mg/dL of glucose, as well as pyuria with 17 WBC per high power field. There was no ketonuria, leukoesterase, or elevated nitrates.\nAP and lateral radiographs of the left femur revealed mottled lucencies consistent with gas in the soft tissues of the medial thigh ().\nA duplex Doppler exam with real time grey-scale imaging, spectral Doppler with wave form analysis, color Doppler, and physiologic maneuvers including compression were done to evaluate the venous system of the left leg from the groin down through the popliteal fossa. Subcutaneous edema was noted in left thigh, but there was no sonographic evidence of deep venous thrombosis.\nThe patient's presentation was most concerning for gas gangrene versus necrotizing fasciitis. Patient looked remarkably well, despite the differential diagnosis. He was resuscitated with 4 L of NSS, 10 U of intravenous regular insulin, 1 g of intravenous Vancomycin, and 3.375 g of intravenous Piperacillin-Tazobactam. He was given 2 oxycodone tablets for analgesia. Patient's mentation remained intact throughout. The patient was then transferred to the critical care unit where he underwent surgical debridement followed by hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics. He also received diabetes education, as he was not taking his Metformin, but rather under the impression that he was doing a good job controlling his diabetes with diet. His decompensated diabetes was likely a contributing cause to his necrotizing fasciitis. Following hospitalization, the patient was discharged with complete resolution of the infection and left with blood sugar well controlled.

Symptomatically, he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 3 days after returning from a trip to Haiti.\nInitial vital signs included temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 86/40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula. Labs showed a white blood cell count of 2.85 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit 25.5%, platelets 43 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, segmented neutrophils 76%, bands 8%, and lymphocytes 12%. Comprehensive metabolic panel showed sodium 144 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 119 mmol/L, bicarbonate 12 mmol/L, BUN 31 mg/dL, creatinine 3.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 units/L, aspartate aminotransferase 55 units/L, alanine aminotransferase 65 units/L, and albumin 2 g/dL. Initial X-ray and CT of the chest did not indicate any acute infiltrates. A CT of the abdomen showed mild circumferential wall thickening of the colon extending from the cecum to the rectum indicative of colitis. Aggressive IV fluid hydration was initiated and he was empirically started on piperacillin-tazobactam. Initial blood cultures preliminarily grew gram negative rods, at which time levofloxacin was added to his regimen.\nWithin 48 hours of admission he began to experience worsening respiratory distress and severe tachypnea, with ABG indices showing a pH of 7.26, pCO2 of 43, pO2 of 64, base excess of (\u22128), and O2 saturation of 91%. Patient was switched to a nonrebreather. He was found to be fluid overloaded with a significant positive fluid balance. The patient had to be placed on BiPap and diuresed with bumetanide. Repeat chest X-ray indicated new right upper lobe infiltrates. After being stabilized he was weaned back to 4 L of O2 via nasal cannula.\nBlood culture identification showed growth of Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139. Based on identification and susceptibility studies, antibiotic treatment was deescalated to intravenous levofloxacin. The bacterial strain was isolated and identified by the Florida Department of Health in Jacksonville, FL.\nHowever, the patient's clinical status once again deteriorated. He began to develop episodes of copious hemoptysis and worsening thrombocytopenia. Intermittent platelet transfusions and a trial of desmopressin were started; however no significant increase in platelet count was seen. Patient's respiratory status continued to worsen through his course progressing to respiratory failure requiring emergent intubation. He continued to have bloody secretions suctioned from the endotracheal tube. Chest X-rays indicated worsening bilateral fluffy infiltrates. In the setting of continued bloody secretions it was felt that the radiological findings may correlate with pulmonary hemorrhage.\nPatient was sent to the operating room for tracheostomy placement and oral packing by the otolaryngologist. Secondary to the extensive amount of oropharyngeal bleeding, vaginal pads were required. The patient was also started on aminocaproic acid, a fibrinolytic inhibitor without any significant improvement. He continued to require full ventilator support and was too hemodynamically unstable to attempt weaning from the ventilator. As his clinical status deteriorated further, he became less responsive and comatose. A CT of the brain revealed a 2 cm hemorrhage in the left cerebellum with mild surrounding edema. He later underwent cardiac arrest and was unable to be revived, ultimately succumbing to his illness. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?",

    "question": "A 73-year-old female presented initially to our emergency department complaining of cough for three weeks duration. She reported productive cough of white-colour sputum, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, exertional shortness of breath and acute limitation of functional capacity to less than two blocks. There was no history of haemoptysis, fever, night sweats, chills, recent infections or hospitalization. She had loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss of ten pounds over a period of 5 months. Past medical history was non-contributory. She was a lifetime nonsmoker with no history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse. She was afebrile, normotensive and maintaining optimal oxygen saturation on room air. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory testing showed white blood cell count of 5.1 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, haemoglobin 10.8 g/dl, haematocrit 32.4% and platelet count 276 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L. Comprehensive metabolic panel revealed serum sodium 141 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 31 mmol/L, BUN 12 mg/dl, creatinine 0.6 mg/dl, calcium 9.3 mg/dl, bilirubin total 0.5 mg/dl, AST 15 mg/dl, ALT 6 mg/dl, ALP 78 mg/dl, total protein 7 g/dl of which albumin was 3.5 g/dl. Serum \u03922-microglobulin was 3.3 mg/L. Thyroid function tests and iron studies were within normal limits. Chest x-ray () revealed right lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion. In comparison, an old chest x-ray performed 3 years ago showed no active lung disease (). Computerized tomography of the chest without IV contrast () on second day of hospital stay revealed moderate right-sided pleural effusion and right lower lobe consolidation. Treatment with levofloxacin was started. She was clinically stable and was discharged with a plan to continue antibiotic for total duration of 7 days. She was scheduled for follow up with chest clinic in 2 weeks. The patient came back after 2 months for follow up at chest clinic. She reported unchanged cough and worsening shortness of breath. Since her symptoms were worsening, she was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On the second hospital admission vital signs were stable, chest CT scan () revealed no significant change in complete consolidation of right lower lobe as compared to previous chest CT scan there was a moderate right-sided pleural effusion and new right upper lobe infiltrate. Abdomen and pelvis CT scan revealed homogeneous attenuation of the liver. Size and contour were maintained with no focal lesions, the pancreas was intact without ductal dilatation, the spleen was normal in size, the adrenal glands were intact, no enlarged lymph nodes were found, no ascites was present and no worrisome osseous lesions were demonstrated. PET/CT scan revealed 2.5 cm infiltrate in right upper lobe and another larger lesion in right lower lobe, both with significant uptake. Moderate right pleural effusion. Bronchoscopy showed polypoid nodularities surrounded by black discoloured mucosa in the sub-segmental bronchi of the right lower lobe, transbronchial biopsy specimen revealed minute fragments of respiratory epithelium with atypical B cell-rich lymphocytes with no evidence of amyloid deposition. Polymerase chain reaction confirmed a clonal B cell gene rearrangement, findings suggestive of low-grade B cell lymphoma. Pleural fluid was sampled and analysis revealed straw-coloured fluid, pH 7.3, white blood cell count of 6400 cells, red cell count of 3750, fluid albumin of 2.2 g/dl (serum albumin 3.0 g/dl), fluid lactate dehydrogenase 52 IU/L (serum lactate dehydrogenase 199 IU/l). Pleural fluid cytology () with immunophenotypic flow cytometry revealed plasmacytoid lymphocytes. Serum immunofixation and free light-chain analysis unveiled large quantity of monoclonal paraproteins which was classified as IgM Kappa immunoglobulin. Concentration of IgM was 1491 mg/dl (range 26\u2013217 mg/dl) while IgG and IgA levels were normal. Urine contained free kappa light chains. The clinical picture, serum IgM paraprotein, bronchoscopy specimen findings and pleural fluid analysis led to the diagnosis of Extramedullary Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s Macroglobulinemia. Patient was started on cyclophosphamide, prednisone and rituximab. Plan was to follow up with IgM level monthly and Chest CT scan after four months.

    "question": "A 43 year-old male was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) of our hospital after his workplace colleagues noted increasingly strange behavior for three days. The patient arrived complaining of generalized fatigue, lethargy, fevers, severe band-like headache, slurred speech, and increasing confusion. Though it was felt that the patient\u2019s history was not completely reliable secondary to confusion, he was able to deny throat pain, chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, recent sick contacts, or recent travel. Review of systems was limited secondary to altered mental status, but he did admit to mild dry cough.\nThough initially denying immune compromise in the ED, the patient later disclosed he was HIV+. He could not recall his CD4 count but stated that his last viral load was undetectable. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Outpatient medications included Atripla, spironolactone, and gemfibrozil. He had a history of unprotected anal sex with men but denied new partners. He had no recent contact with animals. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day but did not drink or use drugs.\nIn the ED, the patient\u2019s temperature was 103.9\u00b0F (39.9\u00b0C). Heart rate was 121 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Blood pressure was 142/90. The patient appeared unwell. He was somnolent but easily aroused. Pertinent findings on general physical exam included a supple neck and decreased breath sounds diffusely. On neurologic exam, he was noted to be dysarthric. He had general slowness of thought and processing. He was slightly confused, though he was oriented and able to name the days of the week forwards and backwards if given sufficient time.\nInitial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 \u00d7 103 cells/mm3, [lab reference range 4.0\u201310.8], hemoglobin of 15.7 g/dL [lab range 14.0\u201318.0], platelet count of 135 \u00d7 103/mm3 [lab range 150\u2013350]. Automated differential showed 87.5% segmented cells (lab range 30-85%), 9.3% lymphocytes (lab range 15-55%), 2.4% monocytes (lab range 0-10%), 0.8% eosinophils (lab range 0-5%), and 0% basophils. No manual differential was performed. A basic metabolic panel showed serum sodium of 134 mmol/L [lab range 137\u2013145], serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L (lab range 3.5-5.1), serum chloride of 100 mmol/L (lab range 98\u2013107), and CO2 of 19 mmol/L [lab range 22.0\u201330.0]. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum glucose were elevated at 33 mg/dL [lab range 9\u201320], 1.8 mg/dL [lab range 0.7\u20131.3] and 159 mg/dL [lab range 70\u201399], respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was high at 581 mg/dL [lab range 0\u201310]. Liver function studies showed an albumin level of 4.4 g/dL (lab range 3.5-5.0), total protein of 7.6 g/dL (lab range 6.3-8.2), total bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (lab range 0.2-1.3), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (lab range 0\u20130.3), alkaline phosphatase of 62 U/L (lab range 38\u2013126), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 49 U/L (lab range 13\u201369), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 89 U/L (lab range 15\u201346). Urinalysis showed 2+ albumin, 3+ blood, trace WBC esterase, negative nitrite, 5\u201310 WBC, 0\u20135 red blood cells (RBC), 5\u201310 epithelial cells, 5\u201310 hyaline casts, 3+ amorphous cells, and 1+ mucous. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities. Nasopharyngeal influenza assay was negative.\nDue to the combination of altered mental status, headache, and fever, a lumbar puncture was performed. The results demonstrated an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 97 mg/dL [normal 40\u201370], CSF protein of 37 mg/dL [normal 12\u201360], and normal cell count and gram stain. Blood cultures were sent.\nA chest x-ray was done and was read as a left hilar mass extending down towards the left lower lobe (see Figure \n). A chest CT was obtained to better characterize the hilar mass (see Figure \n). This chest CT demonstrated a left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia. Based upon the aforementioned findings, the patient was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as empiric acyclovir for herpes encephalitis.\nGiven the findings of dysarthria and altered mental status in an HIV + individual with unknown CD4+ count, a brain MRI was obtained. No contrast was administered secondary to acute renal injury. The diffusion-weighted coronal cut can be seen in Figure \n, demonstrating abnormal restricted diffusion and swelling of the splenium of the corpus callosum without other significant abnormalities. Abnormal T2-weighted signal in the SCC can be seen in Figure \n. These MRI findings in an HIV + individual raised concern for CNS opportunistic infection. However, since the patient was hemodynamically stable, was on antiretroviral therapy, and had a negative lumbar puncture, it was decided to treat the pneumonia initially and closely monitor the patient\u2019s mental status.\nOver the first two to three days of hospitalization, the patient continued to have high fevers, confusion, and dysarthria. His laboratory markers improved on antibiotics. His serum CRP trended down from 581 mg/L at admission to 200 mg/L on day three. After day three the patient began to demonstrate significant clinical improvement. The patient\u2019s admission CD4+ count returned on day three at 156 cells/mm3, and an HIV viral load came back on day four at <20 copies/mL. On day four, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were sent. By day five the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms had resolved, as had his acute renal insufficiency. This same day his Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen returned positive.\nOn hospital day six a repeat MRI was obtained to monitor radiologic progression of the SCC lesion. This repeat study showed partial interval clearing of the previously noted abnormalities: restricted diffusion, abnormal increased flair, and abnormal T2 signally in the SCC. On hospital day seven the patient was discharged home on oral azithromycin. He had no residual deficits. Initial CSF viral studies including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and JC virus all returned negative, as did the syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C serologies. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and routine culture were negative. Legionella antibody IgG titers sent on day four later came back at 1:64. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 17-year-old Caucasian female presented to local hospital with a history of acute alcohol intoxication and ingestion of large quantities of acetaminophen. The patient complained of nausea for 2 days and subjective increase in thirst and urine output for a day. She did not notice any dysuria, abdominal pain or change in the colour of her urine. She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air. Height and weight were recorded at 170 cm and 63 kg. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. No rash, joint swelling or sign of dehydration was detected.\nInitial renal function tests at the local hospital revealed serum creatinine and BUN levels of 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Other laboratory results included: glucose 112 mg/dL, sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate 29 mEq/L, albumin 43 g/L, aspartate transaminase 20 IU/L, alkaline phosphate 66 IU/L and total bilirubin 1.11 mg/dL. Her INR was reported to be normal at 0.9. Toxicity screens on admission showed acetaminophen level at 9.06 \u03bcg/mL. Urine dipstick showed trace amount of blood and 2 plus protein. Microscopy revealed 25 red blood cells per high power field and was otherwise non-contributory. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased hepatic echogenicity and the kidneys were normal in appearance.\nAt the outside hospital, she was given morphine, ondansetron and lansoprazole for her back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Acetylcysteine was not administered as the patient presented more than 24 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen.\nRenal function tests were repeated later that evening and monitored frequently thereafter. Over the course of 36 hours, the patient's serum creatinine and BUN levels elevated from 1.6 mg/dL and 19.3 mg/dL to 5.7 mg/dL and 49.6 mg/dL, respectively. Urine output was reported to be 2.7 mL/kg/hour. At this time, the patient was transferred to our Children's Hospital for rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.\nPhysical examination upon admission showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 115/74 mmHg, pulse 60 bpm, temperature 36.6\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and 100% oxygen saturation at room air. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were measured at 6.3 mg/dL and 52.4 mg/dL, respectively. Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed. However, her serum creatinine and BUN levels peaked at 7.0 mg/dL and 60 mg/dL two days after admission then began to improve without further medical intervention. Her serum creatinine and BUN levels upon discharge were 4.7 mg/dL and 48 mg/dL respectively. Outpatient follow-up at two weeks after discharge showed that she had completely recovered; her creatinine was 1 mg/dL and BUN was 18 mg/dL. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 76-year-old man with a past medical history of prostate cancer, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and recurring pneumonia was found to have a 10-mm nodule in the left lower lung without hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy on CT of the chest with IV contrast (Figure ). CT/PET scan showed abnormal uptake in the lung nodule (Figure ) and grade II cervical lymphadenopathy. CT-guided biopsy of the left lower lung was performed. Histopathology showed a malignant neoplasm of plasmacytoid cells (Figure ). A panel of immunohistochemical stains was performed to further evaluate the lesion. The tumor cells were strongly and diffusely immunoreactive for the melanocytic marker MART-1 (Figure ). However, stains for AE1/AE3, CK7, TIF-1, Napsin, P63, PSA, and PASP were negative. The immunohistochemical results confirmed a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma of unknown primary origin (MUP) to the cervical lymph nodes (LNs) and lungs. The patient had just finished four cycles of ipilimumab when he presented to our clinic complaining of fatigue, generalized weakness, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, and a 10-pound weight loss. The patient denied any fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or diarrhea. He denied any smoking or drug-use history. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 98/60 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The physical exam was unremarkable except for a slightly enlarged left cervical LN, dark pigmentation of the lips and gingiva, and sinus tachycardia without abnormal heart sounds or murmurs. The complete blood count was within normal limits.\nThe labs before starting ipilimumab were as follows - sodium (Na): 140 mEq/L (normal range: 135-145 mEq/L), potassium: (K) 3.6 mEq/L (normal range: 3.5-5.2 mEq/L), chloride (Cl): 105 mEq/L (normal range: 96-106 mEq/L), carbon dioxide (CO2): 28 mEq/L (normal range: 23-29 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 19 mg/dL (normal range: 6-20 mg/dL); creatinine (Cr): 1.3 mg/dL (normal range: 0.8-1.2 mg/dL); albumin: 3.9 g/dL, and glucose: 110 mg/dL (normal range: 64-100 mg/dL); morning cortisol: 17 \u03bcg/dL (normal range: 5-25 \u03bcg/dL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): 14 pg/mL (normal range: <80 pg/mL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 2.4 \u03bcU/mL (normal range: 0.4-5 \u03bcU/mL), and free thyroxin: 1.2 ng/dL (normal range: 0.8-2.8 ng/dL).\nThe labs after four cycles of ipilimumab were as follows - Na: 131 mEq/L, K: 4.1 mEq/L, Cl: 87 mEq/L, CO2: 27 mEq/L, BUN: 6 mg/dL, Cr: 1.1 mg/dL, albumin: 3.7 g/dL, and glucose: 89 mg/dL; morning cortisol: 5 \u03bcg/dL, ACTH: 120 pg/mL, TSH: 5 \u03bcU/mL, free thyroxin: 0.9 ng/dL, testosterone: 437 ng/dL (normal range: 270-1,070 ng/dL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): 3.5 mIU/mL (normal range: 1.5-12.4 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (LH): 6.8 mIU/mL (normal range: 1.24-7.8 mIU/mL), prolactin: 11 ng/mL (normal range: 2-18 ng/mL). Aldosterone was undetectable, and renin was 31 ng/mL/h (normal range for normal sodium diet: 0.6-4.3 ng/mL/h). The patient's HbA1C was 5.7%, and blood culture showed no growth. Urinalysis showed no abnormality and procalcitonin was negative. After the administration of 250 \u03bcg intravenous (IV) cosyntropin, cortisol was found to be 6.8 \u03bcg/dL at 30 mins, and 10.2 \u03bcg/dL at 60 mins, confirming the diagnosis of PAI.\nHe was diagnosed with grade 3 toxicity of ipilimumab and, given his severe symptoms limiting his daily activities, was hospitalized. The patient was immediately started on IV fluid resuscitation and hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus, followed by 50 mg IV every six hours. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without IV contrast revealed no evidence of intraabdominal or pelvic pathology. MRI of the brain with and without contrast revealed no evidence of hypophysitis and no evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. Symptomatic improvement was seen at 24 hours. He was discharged with a four-day taper of hydrocortisone as per the recommendations of the endocrinologist. On his follow-up at the endocrinology clinic, his symptoms continued to improve. A repeat cosyntropin stimulation test showed cortisol levels within normal limits. The patient was started on a second checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, for 16 cycles of treatment while being followed up by an endocrinologist to monitor any side effects. A repeat CT/PET FDG 12 months later showed complete disappearance of the left lung nodule, indicating tumor remission (Figure ). What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 20-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of on and off swelling of both legs and sudden onset weakness of all 4 limbs without any history of loss of consciousness, seizure, headache, sensory loss, or bowel and bladder involvement. There was no history of such a weakness. Additionally, there was no history of dryness of the mouth and eyes (suggestive of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome), no joint pain, oral ulcers, hair loss, or photosensitivity (suggestive of lupus). A neurological examination revealed normal cranial nerves and higher mental functions. Power in the upper and lower limbs was 2/5 and 1/5, respectively. His deep tendon reflexes were diminished, with no plantar response; however, sensory function remained intact.\nThe patient's laboratory profile was as follows: hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dl, total leukocyte count: 14,300/mm3, platelet count: 2.8 \u00d7 105/mm3, urinary protein: 3+, urinary sugar: 0, urine microscopy: white blood cell count: 4-6/high-power field, red blood cell count: 2-4/high-power field, urinary pH: \u22126.5, 24-hour urinary protein: 3.3 g/day, serum albumin: 2.1 g/dl, serum cholesterol: 526 mg/dl, serum triglycerides: 346 mg/dl, C3: 79.6 mg/dl (normal range: 80-160), C4: 62.8 mg/dl (normal range: 20-40), HBsAg: negative, anti-HCV: negative, HIV I and II: negative, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies: negative, blood urea: 29 mg/dl, serum creatinine: 1.2 mg/dl, random blood sugar: 88 mg/dl, corrected serum calcium: 9.4 mg/dl, serum sodium: 143 mEq/l, serum potassium: 2.0 mEq/l, serum chloride: 120 mEq/l, serum PO4: 4.3 mEq/l, arterial blood gas: pH 7.2, pCO2: 31 mm Hg, pO2: 104 mm Hg, HCO3: 12.5 mEq/l, anion gap: 10.5 mEq/l (normal range: 10-12).\nThe urine anion gap (UAG) [Na+ + K+ \u2013 Cl- (70 + 25 \u2212 65 = 30)] was positive. Urinary pH was <5.5 and the fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FeHCO3) was found to be 2, after intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate. Thus, the diagnosis of dRTA was established. Ultrasonography showed normal-sized kidneys with nephrocalcinosis of the medulla (suggestive of type 1 RTA), mild right-sided pleural effusion, and moderate ascites. A renal biopsy showed a thickened basement membrane with subepithelial spikes (fig. , fig. ). The interstitium showed mild mononuclear cell infiltrate and fibrosis with tubular involvement (fig. ). Immunofluorescence was positive for IgG and C3 (fig. ). Thus, the diagnosis of MN was made. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 73-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and Gilbert syndrome was admitted to the hospital with clinical evidence of encephalopathy. On presentation her temperature was 36.5\u00b0 C, blood pressure 165/73 mmHg, pulse rate 76 bpm, and respiratory rate 16 breaths/minute. Her physical examination was otherwise notable for encephalopathy in which she was initially agitated and combative followed by lethargy and disorientation to time, place, and person. There were no focal neurological deficits nor stigmata suggestive of central nervous system infection, vasculitis or cirrhosis. Laboratory investigations included a leukocyte count of 4900 cell/mm3 (normal: 4.8-10.8 * 103cells/mm3), hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL (14.0-18.0 g/dl), platelet count 339,000/mm3 (140,000-440,000/mm3), prothrombin time (PT) 11.5 sec (9.4-11.7), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.03 (0.93-1.11), sodium 144 mmol/L (136-145 mmol/L), potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5.1 mmol/L), chloride 113 mmol/L (98-111 mmol/L), bicarbonate 25 mmol/L (21-31 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 10 mg/dL (6-20 mg/dl), creatinine 0.5 mg/dL (0.6-1.2 mg/dl), calcium 9.6 mg/dL (8.6-10.0 mg/dl), albumin 3.8 g/dL (3.4- 4.8 g/dl), total protein 6.4 g/dL (6.4-8.3 g/dl), aspartate aminotransferase 20 U/L (8-20 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 15 U/L (10-40 U/L), alkaline phosphatase 68 U/L (25-100 U/L), total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL (0.3-1.2 mg/dl), direct bilirubin 0.44 mg/dL (0.0-0.19 mg/dL) and ammonia level 165 mcmol/L (19-60 mcmol/L). Urinalysis and blood cultures were negative.\nCT of the brain was unremarkable. Further laboratory testing revealed a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screen, hepatitis panel, and anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed normal size and echotexture of the liver along with a dilated portal vein and dilated vascular channel within the right hepatic lobe. The liver appeared non-cirrhotic and a liver elastography showed a Metavir score of F1 indicating no evidence of cirrhosis.\nAbdominal CT angiography revealed a dilated portal vein measuring up to 1.8 cm at the porta-hepatis along with dilated superior mesenteric and splenic veins. Multiple dilated vascular channels were seen within the right hepatic lobe. An intrahepatic portosystemic shunt between an enlarged middle hepatic vein and two separate branches of the right portal vein was visualized (Figures -).\nA liver biopsy showed normal architecture with no sign of inflammation or fibrosis. She received conservative management with lactulose and rifaximin. Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy resolved after the second day of admission and she was discharged with close outpatient follow up by gastroenterology and interventional radiology.

    "question": "A 20-year-old female, unmarried, was admitted via the emergency department of our hospital on 11th December 2013 with complaints of generalized weakness since 2 weeks, difficulty in swallowing since 2 weeks, and loose stools since 5 days. The generalized weakness was gradual in onset and more marked in legs, so much so that she was unable to rise from the bed. She also felt difficulty in swallowing and in subsequent days, difficulty even voiding urine. She also complained of loose stools 4 to 5 times a day, semisolid in consistency. No mucous and no blood was noticed. However, these were associated with occasional abdominal cramps. In systemic inquiry, she did not complain of fever, sore throat, rashes, joint pain, swelling, cough, chest pain, dysuria, hematemesis or backache.\nIn the past history, she experienced similar episodes intermittently over the last five years. During these episodes, she used to develop generalized weakness, more of lower limbs, vomiting, and sometimes muscle cramps. With these complaints, she often visited doctors and also required admission in private hospitals, where she was given intravenous (IV) fluids with potassium and her weakness improved. Then she was discharged on potassium containing tablets which would relieve her symptoms. After recovery from the episodes, she used to discontinue oral potassium supplements. She used to remain well for 6 to 8 months before she developed another similar episode and treated similarly. In this way, she recalled 4 to 5 admissions. Record of some investigations seen showed that the predominant abnormality was low potassium level in the serum with normal renal functions.\nDrug history was remarkable for tablet NeoK, capsule Esomeprazole, multivitamin syrup and tablet motilium. She is the only daughter with two brothers who enjoy good health. No family history of similar disease was elicited. Parents were non-consanguineous. She studied till ninth class and then left study due to the recurrent illness. She was not addicted to narcotics. She had adequate appetite and sleep.\nOn examination, she had short stature, lean built, and looked wasted and sick. Her pulse was 88 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP), 90/60 mm Hg, temperature, 98.6\u00b0F and respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute. She was not pale looking, icteric or cyanosed. No koilonychia or clubbing was noted. Dehydration was positive, and muscles were wasted.\nHer abdomen was soft, non tender, with palpable bladder but no other visceromegaly. The chest was clear. Both heart sounds were audible in all four areas. No added sounds were noted. In central nervous system (CNS) examination, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was15/15; power was 3/5 in both lower limbs, 4/5 in upper limbs with intact sensation. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished in all 4 limbs.\nA clinical differential of malabsorption, periodic hypokalemic paralysis, or salt-losing nephropathy was contemplated.\nOn laboratory investigations, serum urea was 73 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.72 mg/dl; sodium, 127 mEq/L; potassium, 1.4 mEq/L; chloride, 101 mEq/L; and bicarbonate, 09 mEq/L. Her hemogram showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 15.1 g/dl; total leucocyte count (TLC), 37.4\u00d7109/L; and platelets, 494\u00d7109/L. Urine analysis revealed pH of 7.00; albumin, 2+; pus cells, occasional; and red blood cells (RBCs), numerous. Corrected anion gap was 22. Further biochemical tests showed serum calcium, 6.4 mg/dl; phosphorus, 3.2 mg/dl; serum albumin, 1.8 g/dl; total bilirubin, 0.86 mg/dl; direct bilirubin, 0.08 mg/dl; alkaline phosphatase, 50 IU/L; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), 14 IU/L; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), 6 IU/L; and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 7 IU/L.\nUltrasound abdomen showed both sided normal size kidneys with mild pelvicalyceal dilatation bilaterally. Bladder was distended with approximate volume of 430 ml. Chest X-ray was done, which was unremarkable (). Electrocardiography done showed flattening of T waves with occasional inversion in some leads, findings typically seen in hypokalemia ().\nShe was catheterized, rehydrated with isotonic saline with KCL, and IV antibiotics started on suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI) as TLC was high. She maintained good urinary output (>1500 ml). By admission day 5, diarrhea had settled. Repeat laboratory tests at this time showed: serum urea of 47 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.6 mg/dl; potassium, 2.5 mEq/L and sodium, 127 mEq/L.\nFurther investigations showed serum magnesium of 1.02 mg/dl. IV magnesium sulphate was administered daily with modest elevation in serum levels during subsequent days. Potassium requirement remained high and was administered by oral and IV routes. On admission day 10, her serum creatinine was 0.85 mg/dl; potassium, 2.6 mEq/L; and magnesium, 0.95 mg/dl. The temporal changes in serum magnesium and potassium are shown in . The 24-h urinary metabolic study on day 10th of admission showed potassium, 44 mmol/24h; magnesium, 50 mg/ 24 h; calcium, 108 mg/24 h (normal range: 100 to 300 mg/24 h). Fractional excretion of magnesium was 27.3%. In the face of low serum magnesium, fractional magnesium excretion should be less than 2%.\nHer gastrointestinal (GI) workup was also done including upper GI endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Upper GI endoscopy revealed normal mucosa, with mild antral erythema. Sigmoidoscopy showed normal mucosa. Tissue biopsies were also obtained. The duodenal biopsy showed mild stunting of villi with slightly increased intraepithelial lymphocytes; the antrum showed mild chronic nonspecific gastritis and the rectosigmoid, mild nonspecific colitis.\nAnti-trangultaminase antibodies and anti-deamidated gliadin-derived peptide antibodies were negative. Final diagnosis was made of GS along with changes of tropical sprue on duodenal biopsy. Genetic testing could not be done due to non-availability of the test.\nShe was discharged on third January 2014 on tablet spironolactone 25 mg, once daily, increased subsequently to 50 mg; tablet Neok, 2 tablets, 8-hourly, capsule magnesium chloride 1 capsule, 8-hourly, tablet folic acid 5 mg, once daily, tablet Ciproxin 250 mg, 12-hourly. Laboratory tests on 2-week follow up showed serum urea of 15 mg/ dl; creatinine, 0.4 mg/dl; sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.6 mEq/L; chloride, 102 mEq/L; bicarbonate, 30 mEq/L; calcium, 8.8 mg/dl; phosphorus, 3.8 mg/dl; albumin, 3.1 g/dl; and magnesium, 1.9 mg/dl.

    "question": "A 28-year-old female patient presented to the orthopedic department with pain in left lower limb after trivial trauma. Past history was significant for repeated episodes of muscle weakness. At that time, she was diagnosed to have hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) and started on oral potassium supplementation. Her physical examination was normal except for subtrochanteric fractures of bilateral femora. There was no muscle weakness of both upper limbs. The power in the lower limbs could not be tested due to fractures of both femora. On investigation, serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dl, BUN 26 mg/dl, S. Na+ - 133 mmol/L, S.K+ 2.7 mmol/L, S. Ca++ 9.7 mg/dl, S.phosphorus 2.1 mg/dl, uric acid 2 mg/dl, S.bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl, SGOT 42 U/L, SGPT 23 U/L, S.albumin 3.2 mg/dl, and alkaline phosphatase 837 mg/dl. Her Vitamin D3 was 10 ng/ml and S.PTH 38.5 pg/ml. Her thyroid function tests were normal. Analysis of arterial blood gases (ABGs) (on room air) revealed pH of 7.22, PaO2 of 61, PCO2 of 23, HCO3 of 11.3 with base deficit of - 17 mmol/L, Na+ - 139 meq/L, K+ 2.3 mmol/L, Ca++ 0.41 mmol/L, Cl \u2212 - 122 mmol/L, and an anion gap of 8 meq/L. The urinary pH was 7.5. On radiological evaluation, there was an acute pathological subtrochanteric fracture of left femur, old subtrochanteric fracture of the right femur and left proximal fibula. On ultrasound abdomen, there was dystrophic parenchymal calcification in the left kidney and mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right side. Tc-99m diethylene triamine penta acetic acid revealed nonfunctioning left kidney with the normally functioning right kidney. Electrocardiography (ECG) was normal except for frequent ventricular ectopics. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. A bone scan showed avid uptake of tracer in right sixth rib, left seventh rib, bilateral proximal femora, left proximal fibula, shaft of the right humerus, and renal cortex [].\nBased on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed to have RTA (distal or type 1, normal anion gap hyperchloremic acidosis) with hypokalemia, nephrocalcinosis, and metabolic bone disease. Surgery was deferred in order to optimize the condition of the patient. The goal of therapy was to maintain serum pH of >7.3 and S.K+ >3 mmol/L. She was started on potassium supplementation intravenously (IV), followed by oral potassium 21 meq tid, tablet alfacalcidol 0.25 mcg, oral sodium bicarbonate 1 g (11.9 mmol) thrice a day, and oral calcium 500 mg BD. After 4 days, ABG analysis showed pH 7.307, PaO296 mmHg, PCO225 mm Hg, HCO312.3 mmol/L with base deficit of - 12.6 mmol/L, K+ 3.1 mmol/L, and Ca++ 0.92 mmol/L. She was posted for interlocking nailing of fracture of left femur to be followed by right femur after 2 days.\nOn the day of surgery, she was premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg and tablet pantoprazole 40 mg 2 h prior to shifting to the operation theatre (OT). In the OT, standard monitors were attached and wide bore IV access was secured. Radial arterial cannulation was done for continuous blood pressure monitoring and ABG analysis. Under strict aseptic precautions, epidural space was located in sitting position at L3-4 intervertebral space through a median approach by the loss of resistance to air with an 18G Tuohy needle. A subarachnoid block was established with the administration of 3 ml of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine with 25 \u03bcg of fentanyl via 27G spinal needle (needle through needle technique). A 22G epidural catheter was passed into the epidural space and fixed at 9 cm. The time taken for onset of the subarachnoid block was approximately 5-6 min and the highest level of the block (T8) was achieved within 13 min. During the procedure, which lasted for 120 min, 1.5 L of ringer lactate was infused and normal saline was avoided. IV sodium bicarbonate and potassium supplementation were given based on ABG findings so as to maintain pH of more than 7.3 and >3 -5 mEq/L. A total of 50 meq of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate and 10 meq of potassium chloride were infused. Intraoperative vitals were stable, blood loss was approximately 300 ml, and urine output was 20-40 ml/h. For postoperative analgesia, a bolus of 8 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine (after a test dose of 3 ml of 2% lignocaine without epinephrine) was given epidurally and an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine was started at 6 ml/h. The operation on the contralateral femur was done under epidural anesthesia 2 days later. Postoperatively, ECG was continuously monitored and ABG analysis was done twice a day for 3 days. Oral bicarbonate and potassium supplements were continued and additional IV supplementation was given as required. She was discharged on the 10th postoperative day.

    "question": "A 69 year old Hispanic female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post revascularization, ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease had presented to our hospital for further evaluation and care. For the past few months the patient had suffered weight loss (approximately 30\u201335 lb), generalized malaise, low grade fevers (99.9 F), non-productive cough, myalgias and arthralgias. She did not endorse any night sweats or recent travel history, and there were no sick contacts at home. Prior to admission to our institution the patient was at an outside hospital and was being treated for sepsis with combinations of antibiotics including intravenous vancomycin, meropenem, echinocandin, metronidazole, and piperacillin tazobactam for 2 to 3 weeks duration as she was developing fevers and productive cough.\nThe physical exam yielded a thin and chronically ill appearing female patient.\nVital signs at the time of admission were notable for hypertension (186/79 mmHg). Her eyes did not show any conjunctival hemorrhaging or icterus, however there was conjunctival pallor. Oropharynx did not show any active exudates or ulcerative lesions. Her cardiac exam did not reveal any murmurs and her airways were clear to auscultation. Abdominal exam revealed palpable splenomegaly. Examination of the extremities did not show nail deformities including splinter hemorrhages or nail pitting. Her skin had no evidence of skin nodularities or other lesions. There was a 1 cm non tender, movable left axillary lymph node. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nInitial laboratory work revealed that the patient had pancytopenia. White blood cell count (WBC) was stated at 2.4 K/uL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.92 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 11.6, and platelet count of 39,000/uL. B2-microglobulin was seen elevated at 9.2 mg/L. Basic metabolic panel obtained showed sodium 134 mEq/L, Potassium 3.5 mEq/L, Chloride 103 mEq/L, Bicarbonate 26 mEq/L, Blood urea nitrogen 30 mg/dl, Creatinine 0.90 mg/dl, glucose 220 mg/dl. Liver function panel showed Albumin 2.2 g/dl, normal transaminases, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl. Urine analysis showed 200 mg/dl of protein and occasional amorphous crystals.\nInitial computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis during hospital admission showed a 15 cm spleen which was heterogenous and micronodular, as well as scattered abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy (Fig. ). No imaging signs of portal hypertension were noted.\nDuring the hospitalization our patient was noted to become more confused and agitated, and there was concern that the patient was having seizures as she was seen numerous times to lose consciousness and awaken, with occasional loss of bladder function. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed subcortical non enhancing FLAIR hyper intense foci in the bilateral posterior occipital lobes.\nLumbar puncture and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) studies were further performed for further analysis, and showed: WBC 1; no red blood cells; protein 62 mg/dL; glucose 35 mg/dL; and, lactate dehydrogenase 234 mIU/mL. Most notable negative findings in the CSF included no detectable viral cultures for cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, herpes virus, and varicella zoster virus, negative cryptococcal antigen serology and negative bacterial and fungal cultures.\nElectroencephalogram studies showed triphasic morphology waves with and without sharp negative component at 2\u20133 hertz. These were seen in continuum mostly with subtle waxing and waning features. To 0.5 mg intravenous alprazolam, above discharges had slowly resolved, replaced by organized background that consists of 6 hertz rhythms. Importantly, there was a clinical improvement after alprazolam; suggesting a nonconvulsive seizures responding to benzodiazepine.\nTwo weeks later after the initial CT imaging and after the patient was more stable from the neurological perspective in order to attempt a lymph node excisional biopsy, a PET-CT imaging was performed and showed complete resolution of the previously detected lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. (Fig. ).\nAdditional serologies for viral hepatitis and autoimmune etiology work up were performed. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and additional serum erythropoietin level, iron profile; cobalamin and folate level were determined.\nThe patient returned to the benign hematology clinic after discharged from the hospital. During her follow up appointment she appeared in better spirits and recovering well. Physical examination was notable for an absence of lymphadenopathy particularly in the cervical and axillary region, as well as no palpable organomegaly in the abdomen. It was further revealed that her antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer was highly positive (1:640), ESR 108 mm/hr with a CRP 6.74 mg/L. Negative viral hepatitis B, C and Human Immunodeficiency virus serologies.\nSerum quantitative immunoglobulin showed a mildly elevated Ig A and Ig G level, without other abnormalities. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis did not reveal a monoclonal gammopathy. Serum free light chain levels showed kappa 96.3 mg/L and lambda 60.06 mg/dL with a normal ratio 1.6 in a patient with chronic kidney disease.\nComplement C3 level was normal with a slightly elevated C4 at 46 mg/dL.\nBone marrow aspirate yielded a predominance of CD3 positive polytypical small T cells and a population of polyclonal B-cells by flow cytometry and negative for lymphoma or other malignant process. A focal lymphohistiocytic aggregate with granuloma formation was noted; occasional larger cells with prominent nucleolus identified; eosinophils were increased mildly in the vicinity of this aggregate. Acid fast bacilli and fungal stains were attempted; however the focal granuloma could not be appreciated at subsequent sections.\nThe patient\u2019s pancytopenia was thought to be likely secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and she was thus referred to rheumatology for further work up, and further testing included anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-RNP, anti-CCP antibody, ANCA vasculitis panel, direct antiglobulin test, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and anti-SSA and anti-SSB. All these tests were negative, thus ruling out systemic erythematous lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other connective tissue disorders.\nThe interval improvement and self-limited clinical course in our case led us to believe that her elevated ANA titers, her bone marrow granuloma were secondary to an EBV infection-related syndrome. Monospot test was not performed and at that point we evaluated for EBV PCR and EBER staining in the bone marrow. Initial EBV PCR results were positive (960 copies/mL), while Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs staining in the bone marrow was negative. Our in situ hybridization stain is validated to work on decalcified bone marrow trephine biopsies and all stains include an on-slide positive control. As such, the likelihood of a false negative result is low. A possible explanation includes a sampling factor with lack of infected B-cells in the bone marrow despite the presence of viremia.\nHer follow up labs during subsequent clinic visits showed WBC 5.3 K/uL, ANC 3.15 K/uL, Hgb 7.4 g/dL, calculated reticulocyte index of 1.1 and platelets 172 K/uL. Iron was 68 ug/dL, transferrin 124.1 mg/dL, ferritin 2952 ng/mL and serum erythropoietin levels were 31.7 mIU/mL. Serum cobalamin was 394 pg/mL and serum folate 12.3 ng/mL. Since there was spontaneous interval resolution of her neutropenia and her thrombocytopenia our diagnosis at that point was cytopenias secondary to infectious mononucleosis and anemia of chronic kidney disease related to diabetes.\nOur patient presented 7 weeks later at the emergency room with a recurrent febrile syndrome with diffuse cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly (Fig. ) and worsening cytopenias: WBC 1800/uL, ANC 1480/uL, Hgb 8.3 gr/dL, platelet count 20,000/uL; a repeat EBV titer revealed 6580 copies/mL. CT imaging with contrast found bilateral axillary, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Low volume retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly with numerous small ill-defined hypodense lesions was in the spleen and probably also within the liver (Fig. ). At this time a repeat bone marrow biopsy and an excisional lymph node biopsy were performed and reviewed. The bone marrow specimen showed a solitary large cell positive for CD30 identified in the clot. No atypical cells are identified in core biopsy as assessed by IHC for CD30 and Pax-5. EBER was positive in few and scattered cells. The lymph node sections demonstrated near-total effacement of the lymph node architecture by a neoplasm comprised of neoplastic cells with Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg morphology. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD15, CD30, PAX5 (weak), and MUM1. They were negative for CD3, CD20, CD45, ALK, and EMA. The findings were diagnostic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, best subtyped as lymphocyte-depleted. (Fig. ). The expression of PAX5 with weak intensity coupled with MUM1 expression by the neoplastic cells is diagnostic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The expression of PAX5, a gene encoding a B-cell-specific transcription factor, excluded T-cell lymphoma as a diagnostic consideration. It is worth noting also that flow cytometry done on a bone marrow sample with involvement by lymphoma showed no evidence of T-cell or B-cell immunophenotypic aberrancies.\nThe patient was started on ABVD chemotherapy regime, bleomycin was held secondary to patient\u2019s history of cardiomyopathy. She received three cycles of chemotherapy with complete clinical remission. Additional cycles of chemotherapy were not completed given prolonged and severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenias that eventually recovered over the following months. A bone marrow biopsy at completion of treatment revealed no morphologic evidence of residual Hodgkin lymphoma. Her most recent surveillance PET-CT imaging, nine months from completion of treatment, showed no hypermetabolic lymphoma and continuing complete metabolic response to therapy.

Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.\nOn presentation vitals were: 37.5\u00b0C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).\nAbdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.\nPiperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).\nHIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis.

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a small amount of ascites and small amount of fluid collection in his bilateral perinephric space. Chest CT showed extensive soft tissue emphysema in his neck and chest wall, extensive mediastinal emphysema, small right pneumothorax, and pericardial fluid (). To rule out esophageal perforation esophagography with gastrographin was performed and it showed no evidence of contrast leakage from his esophagus. The diagnosis of orthorexia nervosa with hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and soft tissue emphysema was made. We started on intravenous fluid supplementation based on treatment of hyponatremia and refeeding syndrome, and oral feeding. He gradually improved, but his total protein and albumin decreased on the 5th hospital day to 4.4 g/dL and 2.5 g/dL, respectively.

    "question": "A 65-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital because of face and limb edema, back pain and severe general fatigue. She had complained of the symptoms of a cold with fever one week before admission. Her consciousness was mildly disturbed, her blood pressure was 80/40mmHg, heart rate was 130/min, respiratory rate was 32 breaths/min and her body temperature was 35.6\u00b0C. Lymphadenopathy was not detected. Skin flush, urticaria, focal angioedema and stridor were not observed. Her breath sounds and heart sounds were normal. An abdominal examination showed cyanotic skin and slight tenderness on the right lower quadrant. Her extremities were cold and markedly edematous. Laboratory data obtained on admission showed the following values: white blood cells 30,600/\u03bcL with a normal fraction, red blood cells 688\u00d7104/\u03bcL, hematocrit 67.2%, hemoglobin 22.1g/dL, C-reactive protein 4.6mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 43mg/dL, creatinine 2.2mg/dL, total protein 5.5g/dL, albumin 3.1g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 34IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 25IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 220IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 363IU/L, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 243IU/L, creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) 27.0IU/L, D-dimer 0.8\u03bcg/mL, blood glucose 428mg/dL, sodium 130mEq/L, potassium 5.1mEq/L, and HbA1c 6.2%. The laboratory test performed later showed that monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG), rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (<20pg/ml) were undetectable. Her arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis (pH: 6.95, PO2: 102mmHg, PCO2: 21.3mmHg, HCO3\u2212: 4.4mmol/L, BE: \u221235.9mmol/L). A chest X-ray film was normal and a plain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed no pleural effusion, pulmonary congestion nor cardiomegaly but mild pericardial effusion (Figure A, C). An electrocardiogram (ECG, Figure B) showed the low voltage of the limb leads, QS pattern in I and aVL, poor R wave progression in V1 to 4 and ST elevation in V4 to 6, which were not found in the electrocardiogram recorded one month previously (Figure A). A portable echocardiography examination was normal except for mild pericardial effusion and the decreased diameter of the inferior vena cava. At this time, we thought the severe hemoconcentration indicated intravascular hypovolemia, which had caused the peripheral circulatory disturbances and the metabolic acidosis. We started infusing extracellular fluids from a central vein with intravenous administration of insulin according to the sliding scale to correct the intravascular volume deficit and to restore hemodynamic stability (Figure ).\nIn spite of continuous intravenous infusion (total about 2000mL), her blood pressure dropped gradually and about two hours later dropped suddenly to be undetectable, but she could respond to our call. The more rapid infusion of the extracellular fluid (about 1500mL) from a central vein with use of the catecholamine (dopamine 5 to 10mcg/kg/min) restored her blood pressure 30 minutes later and then the contrast CT scan was taken. It did not show any findings of pulmonary embolism and acute abdomen such as acute pancreatitis, abscess, and mesentelic arterial occlusion, but it showed pulmonary congestion and massive edema of the whole body (Figure B, D), which were not found by the first plain CT scan. At this time, the portable echocardiography showed normal left ventricular wall motion. One hour after that, hemodynamic deterioration and respiratory failure due to severe pulmonary edema progressed rapidly. Intratracheal intubation was done but the water blew out from the tube and she died about one hour later in spite of the aggressive treatment (Figure ). The laboratory test result on this hemodynamic deterioration was reported after her death and showed the significant progression of the hypoalbuminemia on the following laboratory data: white blood cells 38,000/\u03bcL with a normal fraction, red blood cells 507\u00d7104/\u03bcL, hematocrit 45.6%, hemoglobin 15.7g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 38mg/dL, creatinine 2.3mg/dL, total protein 1.2g/dL, albumin 0.6g/dL, AST 49IU/L, ALT 35IU/L, ALP 100IU/L, LDH 328IU/L, CPK 543IU/L, blood glucose 226mg/dL, sodium 154mEq/L, potassium 3.9mEq/L. Blood cultures were negative.\nThe autopsy showed generalized edema, especially alveolar pulmonary edema without endothelial apoptosis. The pulmonary alveolar spaces were filled with fluids, which were not stained so much by hematoxylin and eosin. The coronary arteries did not have any atherosclerotic stenosis. Inflammatory cells were not found in the edematous tissues. The bone marrow showed no evidence of multiple myeloma. There were no signs of infection.\nShe had a medical history of two previous episodes of generalized edema and fatigue after antecedent flu-like illness. She recovered without any medication. One month before admission, the laboratory data of her regular medical check was normal as per the following values: hemoglobin 12.7g/dL, protein 6.9g/dL, creatinine 0.78mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen 14.8mg/dL. After her death, we diagnosed that our patient had had SCLS in consideration of all these medical histories. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "An 8-year-old Chinese boy with no specific family or psychosocial history was admitted to our hospital with an emergency occurrence of purpura, severe hematemesis, large bloody stools, and sharp abdominal pain. His symptoms had begun 2 weeks prior to admission, with abdominal pain and an erythematous pinpoint rash on his arms. The rash developed from his upper limbs (opisthenar and arms) to his lower limbs. Laboratory examination in the outpatient clinic revealed no abnormalities in indicators such as white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin. After oral medication (specific unknown), his abdominal symptoms began to reduce, as did the purpura. Ten days prior, the rash progressed mostly on the legs, and he experienced deeper abdominal pain in the form of persistent pain with abdominal gassiness and emesis. He was admitted to another hospital with a diagnosis of HSP. Seven days prior, he had melena. After fasting and fluid replacement, there was no obvious improvement in the symptoms. Half a day prior, his face and lips appeared pale, and he had increased abdominal pain, accompanied by numerous bloody stools and hematemesis. He was immediately treated with methylprednisolone, posterior pituitary injection, somatostatin, and hemocoagulase, together with the infusion of large blood products (Table ). At this stage, the patient still produced large amounts of blood in the vomit and stool. His vital signs were extremely unstable, and he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our hospital. The patient had purpura with lower limb predominance and abdominal pain (consistent with one of the following 4 criteria: abdominal pain, histopathology, arthritis or arthralgia, and renal involvement), and was diagnosed with HSP.[\nOn admission, he had severe anemia, with a blood pressure of 76/44 mm Hg, pulse of 135 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min. There was also a palpable purpura rash on both legs, tenderness in the abdomen, and absence of bowel sounds. Routine blood examination revealed a hemoglobin level of 70 g/L, white blood cell count of 11.48 \u00d7 109/L, and platelet count of 13 \u00d7 109/L. The liver function test showed albumin 10 g/L. The serum electrolytes showed sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 2.92 mmol/L, chloride 112.1 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 15.9 mmol/L (Table ) with coagulopathy. Therefore, HSP complicated with an alimentary tract hemorrhage was diagnosed. He was immediately treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg per day), infusion of blood products, and somatostatin but after 2 days after treatment (day 3), he still had massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, poor circulation, a reduced level of consciousness, and unstable vital signs. Abdominal ultrasonography and plain abdominal radiography revealed no enterobrosis. The patient was also evaluated by pediatric surgeons, and the continuation of medical treatment was suggested. However, his condition deteriorated, and he needed to rely on a life-supporting blood transfusion. He developed signs of peritonitis with abdominal distension. Gastrointestinal tract perforation was suspected. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole abdomen revealed curved liquid samples and gas shadows on the left and front of the stomach, supporting the possibility of gastrointestinal tract perforation (Fig. ). On day 4, an emergency laparotomy was performed. The surgery revealed that the anterior wall of the descending duodenum was thinner with a 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm diameter perforation, and the posterior wall had a 3 cm \u00d7 1 cm ulcer, which had penetrated into the peritoneum of the pancreas and experienced active bleeding from the broken end of the vessel. The intraoperative hemorrhage volume was approximately 3000 mL, including intragastric bleeding and intestinal blood clots. Pathological examination indicated chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall mucosa in the descending part of the stomach and duodenum, with hemorrhage, ulceration, interstitial congestion, and edema. Immunofluorescence microscopy of paraffin sections showed granular and lumpy IgA focal deposition in the blood vessel walls (Fig. ). Postoperatively, he was administered nasal continuous positive airway pressure-assisted ventilation, anti-infection treatment, albumin transfusion, platelet transfusion, abdominal drainage, methylprednisolone, fluconazole antifungal treatment, and wound dressing. The general symptoms gradually improved, vital signs were stable, and abdominal pain was relieved. The drainage tube was assessed after discharge, the abdominal CT was repeated after 1 month and the duodenostomy tube was removed 50 days after surgery. There was no evidence of rebleeding during the 2-month follow-up assessment. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 50-year-old male visited our emergency room(ER) because of generalized edema. He appeared remarkably swollen during the past week, with associated reduced urine output. There was no history of body weight change as the patient was bed-ridden. Specifically, he previously had no edematous disorders including congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, liver cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism.\nFourteen years earlier, he was diagnosed with ALS when he was admitted due to quadriparesis. Motor neuron disease was confirmed by electromyography and muscle biopsy. Involvement of the autonomic nervous system in the disease process was noted, and tracheostomy and feeding gastrostomy were in place. In addition, the patient was being supported by a home ventilator.\nOn physical examination, vital signs were stable: blood pressure 144/89 mmHg, pulse rate 90/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and body temperature 35.0\u2103. Peripheral edema was remarkable at the neck, hands, and feet. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL, white blood cells 17,300/mm3, platelet 199,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen 20.8 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 0.25 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.015, albumin 1+, 5\u20139 RBCs per HPF, and many white blood cells. Serum sodium was 123 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 87 mmol/L, and total CO2 20.7 mmol/L. Urine sodium was 16 mmol/L, potassium 29 mmol/L, chloride 17 mmol/L, creatinine 6.8 mg/dL, and urea nitrogen 425 mg/dL. Serum and urine osmolality were 268 and 405 mOsm/kg H2O, respectively. Chest X-ray showed partial atelectasis of both lower lung lobes ().\nIn the ER, isotonic saline was infused to treat hyponatremia at a rate of 40 mL/h. Follow-up tests done at admission showed serum sodium 127 mmol/L, urine osmolality 223 mOsm/kg H2O, urine sodium 12 mmol/L, urine potassium 8 mmol/L, urine chloride 7 mmol/L, and urine creatinine 2.5 mg/dL. Serum uric acid was 7.3 mg/dL, albumin was 2.8 g/dL, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 93 pg/mL, and C-reactive protein was 33.7 mg/dL. Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were present in the urine, but they were not identified due to low abundance. Thyroid hormones T3 and free T4 were normal, serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 63 pg/mL, and the peak level of serum cortisol in response to rapid ACTH stimulation was 48.6 \u00b5g/dL.\nshows the changes in serum sodium concentration and urine volume during the admission. Soon after admission, serum sodium dropped to 121 mmol/L despite isotonic saline infusion. Notably, true oliguria (200 mL/d) was encountered in association with increasing edema. We had to use intravenous furosemide, and a small volume (500 mL) of 3% saline was given once. The patient's oliguria persisted for 3 days, at which time generalized aggravation of the patient's edema was noted, and hyponatremia was not improved by diuretic therapy (). Intravenous furosemide was gradually increased (10 to 60mg) and was finally administered by continuous infusion (240 mg/d).\nFurosemide was switched into tolvaptan to treat hypervolemic hyponatremia. The initial dose of tolvaptan 15 mg induced an increase in urine output (1,500 mL/d), while serum sodium remained the same (121 mmol/L). On the following day, polyuria was induced by tolvaptan 30 mg in association with an improvement in hyponatremia (). Urine sodium increased from 12 to 56 mmol/L, and urine osmolality decreased from 223 to 147 mOsm/kg H2O. When the serum sodium approached 130 mmol/L, the daily dose of tolvaptan was reduced to 15 mg. Over the next 2 weeks, the patient's edematous state, urine volume, and hyponatremia were stabilized with continued tolvaptan therapy. Following discharge, having been off tolvaptan for approximately one month, the patient's serum sodium concentration was 132 mmol/L. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 32-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of marked edema of 5 days' duration. Past medical history included: Bipolar disorder, panic disorder, hypothyroidism, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Her daily home medications included lithium carbonate 900 mg, synthroid 75 \u03bcg, cymbalata 60 mg, nortryptiline 30 mg, cipralex 30 mg, gabapentin 600-900 mg, and ibuprofen 200 mg. The patient had been on a stable dose of lithium for approximately 5 years experiencing no side effects. She presented to the hospital with a 5-day history of severe fatigue, migraine-like headaches, lethargy, and significant anasarca. Associated with these symptoms were upper extremity tremors as well as polyuria and polydipsia. She denied chest pain, shortness of breath, constitutional symptoms, and any urinary symptoms. Social history included 10-pack year history of tobacco.\nOn admission, the patient's vital signs were: Blood pressure 115/61, heart rate 61 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. The patient was afebrile. There was generalized + 2 edema of lower extremities, upper extremities, and periorbital regions. Minimal bibasilar crackles were appreciated. The remainder of the cardiovascular and abdominal examination was unremarkable.\nBlood work showed a plasma creatinine level of 119 \u03bcmol/L (baseline 69 \u03bcmol/L) and a blood urea of 10.4 mmol/L. Urine dipstick showed a specific gravity of 1.016, pH 7.5, and 4 + protein; and was negative for glucose, ketones, and nitrites. Microscopy revealed oval fat bodies and free fat droplets. The urine albumin to creatinine ratio was 973.4 mg/mmol and 24-h urine protein was 15.69 g. On admission, serum lithium level was 2.66 mmol/L (therapeutic 0.50-1.50 mmol/L). Serum sodium was 130 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 27 mmol/L. A complete blood count demonstrated hemoglobin 106 g/L, white blood cell count 9.46 \u00d7 109 /L, and platelet count 234 \u00d7 109 /L. Serum albumin was low at 20 g/L; but all liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and coagulation studies were within normal limits. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was 18.90 mU/L and free T4 8.2 pmol/L. Serology for hepatitis B and C, anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, ribonucleoprotein, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, inflammatory myositis, and Smith antibody were all negative. Antinuclear antibody was slightly positive on admission. Chest radiographs revealed nonspecific bibasilar infiltrates. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated normal kidneys with no renal calculi or hydronephrosis.\nLithium treatment was discontinued immediately and the patient was treated conservatively with fluids. Initially the patient refused renal biopsy. Once stabilized, she was discharged from the hospital and lithium remained discontinued. At 2 months follow-up, the patient experienced worsening anasarca, significant acute kidney injury (AKI; serum creatinine 209 \u03bcmol/L), and persistent proteinuria. She was readmitted to the hospital and subsequently underwent a renal biopsy, when at the time her creatinine peaked at 348 \u03bcmol/l. On light microscopy, there was no global sclerosis, crescent formation, or necrotic lesions capillary wall thickness was normal. There was evidence of moderate focal interstitial fibrosis []. Immunofluorescence did not demonstrate any immune deposits. Electron microscopy revealed widespread fusion of podocyte foot processes affecting more than 75% of the surface of glomerular capillary loops []. No electron dense deposits were evident. A diagnosis of MCD secondary to lithium use was established and the patient was started on high dose corticosteroids, initially intravenously, but changed to oral prednisone 80 mg daily on discharge. Over the next 2 months of follow-up, the patient's creatinine, proteinuria, and edema all decreased significantly and she was tapered to oral prednisone 40 mg. At her 4 months follow-up, her albumin/creatinine ratio had decreased to 220 mg/mmol and she remained on oral prednisone 40 mg daily. Her edema as well as AKI had resolved.

    "question": "A 52-year-old white male with O2-dependent COPD, hypertension, GERD, idiopathic gastroparesis, and chronic low back pain was noted to have persistent hypokalemia in the 2.7\u20133.3 meq/L range over more than 2 years. He complained also of chronic generalized weakness and fatigue. He denied nausea or vomiting, but did have occasional loose stools. The hypokalemia persisted despite discontinuation of diuretic treatment for hypertension and fludrocortisone that had been prescribed briefly for orthostatic hypotension. There was no improvement with aggressive oral potassium supplementation in amounts up to 120 meq per day. The patient's serum potassium level normalized on three occasions when he was hospitalized and given supplemental potassium (COPD exacerbations in 7/06 and 1/07, pseudoseizures in 7/07), but the hypokalemia promptly recurred after discharge from the hospital (Figure ). His medications were paroxetine, trazodone, pregabalin, sustained-release morphine, loratadine, isosorbide mononitrate, lisinopril, metoprolol, simvastatin, omeprazole, metoclopramide, potassium chloride, calcium/vitamin D tablets, alendronate, and mometasone, tiotropium, and albuterol inhalers. He smoked one-half pack of cigarettes per day and did not drink alcohol.\nOn physical examination, he was a chronically ill-appearing man wearing a nasal cannula. Height was 69 inches, weight 205 pounds. There were no cushingoid facies, buffalo hump, or abdominal striae. Vital signs were temperature 98.6 degrees, pulse 95, respiratory rate 14, blood pressure 128/73. There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. Lungs showed decreased breath sounds and mild expiratory wheezes bilaterally. Heart sounds were regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, with no masses or organomegaly. Extremities showed no edema, clubbing or cyanosis. The neurologic examination revealed mild generalized muscular weakness (4+/5) and normal deep tendon reflexes.\nLaboratory results include serum sodium 137 mg/dL, potassium 3.0 mg/dL, chloride 95 mmol/L, CO2 30.0 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 5 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, calcium 9.3 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.1 mg/dL, albumin 3.6 g/dL, ferritin 126 ng/mL, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, white blood cell count 10.6 K/cmm, and platelet count 160 K/cmm. Serum aldosterone was 4.8 ng/dL (normal 4\u201331 ng/dL) and the plasma renin activity was 0.33 ng/mL/hr (normal 1.31\u20133.96 ng/mL/hr upright, 0.15\u20132.33 ng/mL/hr supine). Spot urine potassium was 8.6 mEq/L, urine sodium was < 10 mEq/L, and urine chloride was 16 mmol/L.\nIn the absence of a clear explanation for this patient's chronic hypokalemia, he was asked to give the details of his diet. He admitted to drinking 4 liters of Pepsi-Cola per day for the past several years. It was his habit to sip cola slowly but almost continuously, throughout the day. When hospitalized, he had stopped drinking cola and his potassium levels had temporarily normalized. In early May 2008, he decreased his cola intake to 2 liters per day, with a resultant increase in the serum potassium from 3.0 to 3.5 mg/dL (Figure ).

    "question": "A 41-year-old man with a history of alcohol intake (90 g ethanol/day for three years) was admitted to Jeju Hospital in June 2004 due to a traffic accident in which he sustained a right distal radius fracture. During the hospital stay, he developed jaundice and was diagnosed with an aneurysm of the distal descending thoracic aorta. He was then transferred to Yonsei Medical Center, where he received further treatment.\nThe physical examination upon admission revealed the following vital signs: blood pressure 160/110 mmHg, pulse rate 85 beats/minute, respiration rate 18 breaths/minute, and body temperature 36.7\u2103. There was a slight hepatosplenomegaly without evidence of other abdominal masses. Laboratory tests revealed the following: hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL, hematocrit 38.7%, white blood cell count 5,720/\u00b5L with 59.4% polymorphonuclear cell, platelet count 97,000/\u00b5L, sodium 136.5 mEq/L, potassium 3.97 mEq/L, chloride 96.7 mEq/L, bicarbonate 23.9 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 6.5 mg/dL, creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, total protein 8.8 g/dL, albumin 3.7 g/dL, total bilirubin 2.6 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 159 IU/L, AST 82 IU/L, ALT 27 IU/L, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 605 IU/L, prothrombin time 70%, c-reactive protein 1.61 mg/dL, HBsAg negative, anti-HBs negative, anti-HBc negative, anti-HCV negative, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 7.52 ng/mL, and protein induced by vitamin K absence II 158 mAU/mL.\nOn the first day of hospitalization, a computerized tomography (CT) of the aorta and a dynamic CT of the liver were taken. The CT of the aorta showed a fusiform shaped aneurysm at the distal descending thoracic aorta measuring 4 cm at the maximal diameter, with circumferential calcification of the aneurysm wall. The CT also revealed surface nodularity of the liver, suggesting liver cirrhosis, and numerous small nodules throughout the entire liver. The dynamic liver CT showed multiple nodular lesions with arterial enhancement and delayed washout in both lobes of the liver (). On the fifth day, a US-guided liver gun biopsy was performed on a 2.5 cm-sized hyperechoic nodule with a peripheral halo in the right lobe of the liver (). The liver biopsy showed a hepatocellular nodule with slightly increased cellularity, fatty change, and Mallory bodies (). It also showed unpaired arteries and focal sinusoidal expression of CD34, indicating increased angiogenesis in the nodule; however, both the structural and cytological atypia were unremarkable and there was focal iron deposition. The background revealed alcoholic micronodular cirrhosis. From these observations, the lesion was tentatively diagnosed as a hypervascular hyperplastic nodule in alcoholic cirrhosis. On the twelfth day, a percutaneous transarterial angiography with stent insertion at the aortic aneurysm was performed. Two days later, an aortic CT demonstrated the complete exclusion of the aneurysm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver was performed on the fifteenth day revealed underlying liver cirrhosis and numerous nodules that showed high signals on T1 weighted images, but there were some with a central low signal portion (). Among those, arterial phase enhancing nodules were present, suggesting overt HCCs. Other nodules also showed central enhancement patterns, suggesting dysplastic nodules with subfocus HCCs (). On the nineteenth day, a second liver gun biopsy was performed on the same lesion as the first biopsy and demonstrated the same pathological features. From these findings, the possibility of mistargeting the biopsy was ruled out and the diagnosis of hypervascular hyperplastic nodules in alcoholic cirrhosis was confirmed. Hepatic angiography performed on the twenty-fourth day showed faint multiple nodular staining of both liver lobes in the early arterial phase (). The patient was discharged three days after the hepatic angiography and scheduled for an outpatient follow-up. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "23-year-old female presented to the Emergency Room with carpopedal spasms and tingling numbness in hands. Patient endorsed tingling sensation in hand since a month which was intermittent and unrelated to wrist movement. She denied history of preceding trauma and swelling in hands. There was no history of similar complaints in the past or any prior surgery. She denied complaints like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Tingling in hands was not associated with paresthesia in other extremities and sensory or motor deficits. Patient was a known case of multidrug resistant tuberculosis and was being treated with the following drugs for two months: amoxicillin-clavulanate, ethionamide, intramuscular capreomycin, linezolid, and para-aminosalicylate (PAS) granules. Patient was afebrile and her initial vital signs were normal with a pulse of 78/min and blood pressure of 110/76 mm of Hg. On examination, flattening of chest wall on the left side was noted. Trail's sign was positive with a deviation of the trachea to the left side. On auscultation of lung fields, breath sounds were diminished on the left. These findings suggested presence of tuberculous fibrosis in the left lung. No other stigmata of TB were noted and rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nInitial blood-work at the time of presentation revealed a low serum calcium level of 6.98 mg/dL. Patient was hospitalized and detailed investigations were done. Coexisting with hypocalcemia, other electrolyte abnormalities noted were as follows: serum sodium of 130 mEq/L, potassium of 1.8 mEq/L, chloride of 95 mEq/L, calcium of 6.98 mg/dL, and magnesium of 0.5 mg/dL. Serum albumin was 4 g/dL. Serum creatinine was normal and remained so throughout the course of hospitalization. The arterial blood gas evaluation showed metabolic alkalosis without respiratory compensation with pH of 7.5, HCO3 of 30 mEq/L, and PaCO2 of 30 mmHg. Routine urine examination revealed a 2\u20134 pus cells, 1-2 RBCs, and 1-2 epithelial cells, in the absence of proteinuria and glycosuria. Urine calcium/creatinine ratio was 0.49 (>0.2), which confirmed hypercalciuria. Urinary prostaglandin-E level was not performed as this assay is not readily available in our institute.\nVitamin D and serum parathyroid levels were found to be in the normal range, thus ruling out hypovitaminosis D and secondary hyperparathyroidism, respectively. Patient was treated symptomatically; injectable calcium, magnesium, and potassium were administered to correct electrolyte abnormalities. Due to the association of aminoglycoside antibiotics with alterations in electrolyte levels, capreomycin was discontinued. Subsequently, the electrolytes started to rise after two days of stopping capreomycin (). Patient was discharged once her symptoms resolved and the serum electrolytes were normalized. On follow-up, there were no complains of tingling sensations or carpopedal spasms and electrolytes remained to be in the normal range. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.\nDifferential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.\nAfter four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

    "question": "A 54-year-old female patient who had type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure and ESRD was admitted to our nephrology clinic. She had complaints of increasing shortness of breath, orthopnoea, fatigue and generalized pruritus. Her complaints also included daytime sleepiness, sudden awakening at night without witnessed apnoea. She had been on haemodialysis three times weekly for 3 years. At admission, she appeared non-distressed, blood pressure was 160/80 mmHg, heart rate was regular 78 bpm, she was afebrile and had 3/6 systolic ejection murmur on mitral region. There were diminished breath sounds at the lung bases; she had pedal oedema +/+ bilaterally. She had 5 kg above her dry weight. Thyroid gland was normally palpable. The urine output was \u223c100 ml/day.\nInitial biochemistry revealed BUN: 117 mg/dl, Cre: 5.9 mg/dl, Na: 141 mEq/l, K: 3.3 mg/dl, Cl: 83 mEq/l, albumin: 2.9 g/dl, TSH: 29.3 mU/l and free T4: 0.54 pmol/ dl. On complete blood count, haemoglobin was 9.7 g/dl, WBC 8700/mm3 and platelets 160 000/mm3. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed pH: 7.637, HCO3: 45 mmol/l, PaCO2: 43 mmHg, PaO2: 53 mmHg and oxygene saturation: 93%.\nHer medications included insulin glargine, l-thyroxine, quetiapine, sertralin, enalapril, furosemid and bisoprolol.\nThe patient had severe metabolic alkalosis. However, there were no conditions that could lead to metabolic alkalosis, i.e. vomiting, nasogastric suction or alkali administration. On further inquiry, she revealed that she had been taking baking soda occasionally for \u223c6 years in order to relieve dyspepsia. During the last month, she increased the amount of ingestion to 4\u20135 packs per day due to severe dyspeptic complaints. She underwent upper endoscopy for dyspeptic complaints a few months prior to current admission, and the procedure revealed chronic gastritis.\nWe attributed the presence of metabolic alkalosis to oral alkali intake, because she did not have sufficient renal function to excrete excess alkali load. She was not hospitalized previously for any reason at our institution, and routine ABG analysis was not done at her dialysis centre. Thus, we do not exactly know her acid\u2013base status prior to this admission. We performed haemodialysis with a haemodialysis solution whose bicarbonate concentration was 8 mEq/l below standard bicarbonate value, i.e. 26 mEq/l. We also monitored ABG values. After three consecutive haemodialysis sessions with this bicarbonate value, subsequent ABG analysis revealed pH: 7.338, HCO3: 19 mmol/l, PaCO2: 37 mmHg and PaO2: 74 mmHg. l-thyroxine dose was increased to attain euthyroid state. Her presenting symptoms were relieved at follow-up with the normalization of volume status, metabolic alkalosis and hypothyroidism. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 60-year-old lady, a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years and hypertension for 3 years, presented to the clinic with fever, chills, and bilateral loin pain of 4 days duration. No other co-morbidities like chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease were known in her in the past and she was apparently in normal state of health prior to the presenting illness.\nShe developed high-grade fever with chills and rigors. Fever was accompanied by dysuria and bilateral loin pain which was constant and aching in nature. Two days following the onset of fever and loin pain, she developed hematuria and subsequently her urine output started declining and she was anuric at the time of admission to the hospital. She also experienced severe generalized muscle ache. There was no arthralgia, skin rash or hemoptysis. Her medications included glipizide and multivitamin.\nAt the time of admission, she was conscious, irritable, febrile, and tachypneic. Her conjunctivae appeared suffused. There was no icterus, purpura, or lymphadenopathy. Muscle tenderness in limbs was noted. Her pulse was 104/min, BP\u2013110/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate 23/min, temperature 101\u00b0F, oxygen saturation 95% at room air. Rales were appreciated in the basal regions of the chest. Examination of abdomen revealed no organomegaly, but both renal angles were tender on palpation.\nInvestigations revealed hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL; leukocyte count of 28400 cells/\u03bcL; differential count revealed polymorphs 91%, lymphocytes 8%; platelet count 60000/\u03bcL. The blood film revealed normocytic normochromic RBCs, neutrophilic leucocytosis with toxic granulations. No hemoparasites were detectable. Urine analysis revealed 1+ protein, 40-50 WBCs/high power field, 20-25 RBCs/high power field, bile salts and pigments - negative, ketone-negative. Blood sugar on admission was 208 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen 74 mg/ dL; serum creatinine 5.4 mg/dL; serum sodium 138 mmol/L; potassium 4.8 mmol/L; bicarbonate 7.0 mmol/L; chloride 104 mmol/L; plasma anion gap +27 mmol/L, pO290 mm Hg., pCO226 mm Hg. Serum total bilirubin measured 2.1 mg/dl; SGOT \u2013 44 U/L; SGPT \u2013 34 U/L; alkaline phosphatase \u2013 242 U/L; serum total protein 6.5 g/L; and serum albumin measured 2.4 g/ dL. Urine culture revealed significant growth of E. Coli., (>105 colony forming units/ ml) sensitive to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and ceftriaxone. However, blood culture grew no organism. Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed bilaterally enlarged kidneys with hydroureteronephrosis. No radioopaque lesion could be made out in the ultrasonogram or X-ray KUB region. An MR urogram performed to further evaluate the obstruction [] revealed bilateral renal papillary necrosis (RPN) with bilateral midureteric obstruction.\nThrombocytopenia and severe myalgia prompted a search for leptospirosis, a common cause of AKI in this part of the country. The organism could not be isolated from the urine or blood. However, the MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test) done in the second week of the illness detected Leptospira icterohemorrhagica; serovar hardjo. Serologic investigations for dengue were negative.\nShe was subjected to a USG-guided renal biopsy which revealed acute tubular necrosis, interstitial inflammation, and mild mesangial proliferation [Figure \u2013].\nThe patient was treated with hemodialysis and her antibiotics included benzyl penicillin and ceftriaxone. Gradually, the fever settled, her general condition stabilized, and renal function started to improve. By the 20th day of the illness, serum creatinine was 1.7 mg/ dL and platelet count was 190,000/\u03bcL and patient was discharged. Follow-up at 3 months revealed a serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL.

    "question": "A 57-year-old Turkish woman presented to an emergency department with a 7-day history of fever, jaundice, abdominal distention, personality changes, slurred speech, and constipation. The patient was born in a village and lived in the eastern part of Turkey. The patient had a history of hepatic Echinococcus multilocularis, which had been diagnosed 8 years earlier, and she was receiving oral albendazole at a dose of 800 mg per day. At the time of evaluation, she appeared ill. He had a temperature of 38.2 \u00b0C, a blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg, and a heart rate of 86 beats per minute. Her conjunctivas were icteric. There was moderate hepatomegaly with tense ascites. There was no splenomegaly. Her neurologic examination showed flapping tremor (asterixis) and somnolence. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood tests showed a white-cell count of 11,800/mm3. An automatic differential cell count revealed 52% eosinophils, 40% neutrophils, and 8% lymphocytes. The hemoglobin level was 10 g/dl, the platelet count was 209,000/mm3, the prothrombine time was 17 seconds, and D-dimer level was 5.5 (normal range, 0 to 0.5). The serum sodium level was 125 mmol/L; chloride, 102 mmol/L; potassium, 3.8 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 21 mmol/L; blood urea nitrogen, 10 mg/dl; creatinine, 0.7 mg/dl; glucose, 80 mg/dl; albumin level, 2.8 g/dl; globulin level 4.8 g/dl; aspartate aminotransferase level, 56 U/L (normal range, 0 to 41); alanine aminotransferase level, 48 U/L (normal range, 0 to 40); alkaline phosphatase level, 378 U/L (normal range, 40 to 125); gammaglutamyl transferase level 121 U/L (normal range, 0 to 45) and total bilirubin level, 8 mg/dl (normal range, 0.0 to 0.8 ). Blood ammonia level was 212 mmol/L (normal range 11 - 51) and C-reactive protein level was 48 U/L (normal range 0 - 5). The ELISA test for E. multilocularis was also positive.\nAn abdominal paracentesis showed 800/mm3 white cell (50% eosinophil); the further examinations in ascitic fluid revealed the glucose level was 87 mg/dl, the protein level was 3.7 mg/dl and the albumin level was 1.5 mg/dl. Serum ascites-albumin gradient was calculated as 1.3 g/dl. At the time of emergency admission, an abdominal ultrasonography showed a hepatic mass, ascites and lack of the visualization of the hepatic veins. An abdominal CT scan also demonstrated multiple hepatic masses in the right lobe of the liver, the largest of which was 12 cm in diameter, nonuniform contrast enhancement of the liver parenchyma, an enlarged caudate lobe, and hepatic and portal vein thrombosis with ascites (). Her echocardiography revealed no major cardiac abnormality. The patient was considered as hepatic encephalopathy due to acute BCS and was given dextrose-containing intravenous fluids with low molecular weight heparin. Ammonia-lowering therapy with rifaximin was also initiated. On day 5 of the patient\u2019s hospitalization, her ammonia level was in normal ranges and clinical parameters were gradually normalized. At this time, albendazole (15 mg/kg per day in divided doses) was also started as adjunctive therapy and she was discharged from hospital with close follow-up.

    "question": "A 65-year-old man was referred to the hospital in 5th July 2019 because of refractory edema in both legs.\nThe patient had a history of CKD stage 3a, a hypotrophic left kidney, and hypertension. He had been prescribed amlodipine 2.5 mg for hypertensive medication. He also underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer two years earlier. He underwent pelvic MRI using gadoterate meglumine (15 mL), immediately after iodide contrast-enhanced chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) for cancer surveillance. Thirty days before CT scan, his creatinine level was 1.28 mg/dL and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 58 mL/min/1.73 m2. After 185 days, he visited a local clinic because of edematous changes in both lower extremities. CT angiography of the lower extremities was performed; no stenosis or occlusion of vessels was observed. Although diuretics were administered for 2 weeks, the edema worsened and was accompanied by pruritus and pain (). Eventually, he was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\nUpon admission, his body temperature was 36.8\u00b0C and his blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. His height was 161.3 cm, weight was 53.2 kg and body mass index was 20.4 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed grade 2+ pretibial pitting edema with redness, mild heat, and tenderness in both lower extremities. Both inguinal lymph nodes were not enlarged.\nInitial laboratory findings at admission (about 210 days after MRI scan) were as follows: white blood cell count, 6,200 /\u03bcL (neutrophil 66%, lymphocyte 22%, monocyte 10.3%, eosinophil 0.5%); hemoglobin, 10.7 g/dL; platelet, 253,000 /\u03bcL; blood urea nitrogen, 41 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 2.07 mg/dL; eGFR, 32 mL/min/1.73 m2; serum sodium, 134 mmol/L; potassium, 3.4 mmol/L; chloride, 102 mmol/L; total CO2, 20 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.5 mg/dL; total protein, 6.9 g/dL; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; aspartate transaminase, 43 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 15 U/L; and C-reactive protein, 0.96 mg/dL. Routine urine analysis revealed a pH of 6.0 and trace proteins. Red and white blood cells were absent in the urine. The spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was 209 mg/g and the spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio was 60 mg/g. Thyroid function tests were normal: thyroid stimulating hormone, 2.47 \u03bcIU/mL and free T4, 0.98 ng/dL. Fractional excretion of Na 0.1% and Fractional excretion of urea on admission was 17.6%, which suggested the patient was prerenal AKI.\nChest radiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. During doppler sonography of both lower extremities, the venous velocity was normal and there was no evidence of thrombosis. None of the aforementioned findings were suggestive of refractory edema.\nFluid therapy was administered to treat the AKI, which was probably caused by the diuretics he was given during his two-week stay in the local clinic. Subsequently, his renal function improved: serum creatinine, 1.18 mg/dL; and eGFR, 63.9 mL/min/1.73 m2. Since the redness and tenderness of both legs were suggestive of cellulitis-associated edema, intravenous cefazolin was administered for two weeks. However, the lesion gradually spread from his ankle to his thigh and changed into fibrotic induration. Contracture of the ankle and knee joints also occurred ().\nTo detect diffuse or localized systemic sclerosis, antinuclear antibody, anti-Scl 70 antibody, and anti-centromere antibody tests were performed, but the results were all negative. Also, eosinophilia and paraproteinemia was not seen, which is commonly accompanied in scleromyxedema or eosinophilic fasciitis. Although approximately 50 weeks had passed since he was exposed to the gadolinium, the characteristic clinical features led to the suspicion of NSF. A biopsy of the right anterior tibial skin lesion was performed to examine tissue for disease. This revealed unique features of the NSF such as dermal thickening with collagen fibers extending into the subcutaneous septa and a large number of spindle-shaped fibrocytes (). Neither eosinophilic tissue infiltration nor fat necrosis with calcification of adipocytes was found.\nSystemic methylprednisolone (20 mg/day) was administered for two weeks to treat the NSF. Additionally, UV-A1 topical phototherapy of 1.5 joule (J)/cm2 was administered to the lower leg lesion twice a week. The patient underwent intensive physical therapy including stretching, pneumatic compression, and Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation . We administered MTX 15 mg weekly while reducing the methylprednisolone dose weekly by half until a dose of 2 mg/day was administered. Simultaneously, the UV-A1 intensity was gradually increased to 3.0 J/cm2. After 6 months of treatment, the reddish edema improved and the skin induration decreased. Although the contracture of the ankles was still present (), there was no further disease progression. Currently, the patient receives MTX (10 mg) weekly and methylprednisolone (2 mg) daily.\nInformed consent for publication of clinical data was submitted by the patient and the images are published with the consent of the patient.

He had a recent admission due to community acquired pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics. He denied using any illicit drugs or alcohol abuse. He was retired truck driver by profession.\nOn examination, he was an elderly man with clinical signs of dehydration. Blood pressure was 155/56 mm Hg, heart rate was 67/min, respiratory rate was 16/min, was afebrile, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He had mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rigidity. He had bilateral lower extremities chronic skin changes with scaling. The rest of the physical examination was normal.\nSignificant laboratory data revealed serum sodium 124 mEq/mL, potassium 5.1 mEq/mL, chloride 89 mEq/mL, bicarbonate 15 mEq/mL, blood urea nitrogen 44 mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, glucose 85 mg/dL, calcium 10.3 mg/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, and albumin 2.9 g/dL. The rest of the liver function tests were within normal limit. Anemia was with hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit 27%, platelets 558 k/\u03bcL, and white blood cells 10.4 k/\u03bcL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 25 mm Hg, pO2 of 90.3 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. There was an anion gap of 20, lactic acid of 4.8 mmoles/L, serum lipase of 1540 U/L, amylase 406 unit/L, gamma GT 25 unit/L, INR 1.3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 950 unit/L; cancer antigen CA 19-9 was 49.9 \u03bc/mL, TSH was 2.25 mIU/L, serum acetone was negative, and alcohol level was less than 10 mg/dL. His serial cardiac enzymes were negative and he was ruled out for an acute coronary event.\nChest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral patchy airspace disease. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with homogeneous attenuation and without significant peripancreatic inflammation () with extensive retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy (). A para-aortic lymph node measuring 2.1 cm and retrocaval lymph node measuring 1.6 cm were seen. A soft tissue density surrounding the right common iliac vessels likely representing confluent adenopathy was seen. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 67%; right ventricle systolic pressure was estimated to be 44 mm Hg. Pericardium was normal without any pericardial effusion. There was no significant valvular abnormality.\nInitially, the patients EKG showed 2nd degree Mobitz type I block which later progressed to complete heart block. Patient was given atropine without improvement; hence, a temporary pacemaker was inserted. He was started on IV hydration and IV antibiotics and all his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. His temporary pacemaker lead came out and it was removed. Subsequently he became unresponsive, was orally intubated, had four cardiac arrests, and was successfully resuscitated. Due to persistent pulmonary infiltrates he underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies which showed evidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). He was started on Bactrim for the treatment of PJP. He tested positive for HIV and was found to have a CD 4 count of 12/uL.\nA temporary pacemaker wire was again placed after ruling out the relevant reversible causes of third degree heart block. A repeat echocardiogram was unchanged from prior one. CT-guided biopsy of the para-aortic lymph nodes was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with marked tumor necrosis (). Immunoprofile showed that CD 20 (), CD 79a, and CD 10 were positive. CD 43, CD 3, CD 7, and BcL were negative. Upper endoscopy for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement showed gastric polyps which revealed gastric lymphoma on biopsy.\nPatient was not a candidate for chemotherapy or ART due to critical condition.

She was treated with spironolactone (100 mg/day), magnesium lactate (1.2 g/day), potassium chloride (5.4 g/day) and indometacin (25 mg/day).\nThe patient was recently admitted to our Nephrology Department with oliguria and progressive facial and lower limb oedema 15 days in duration. Her blood analyses showed urea 60 mg/dL, creatinine 0.93 mg/dL, Na 138 mmol/L, K 3.3 mmol/L, Cl 98 mmol/L, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, Ca 8.2 mg/dL (ionic 1.08), P 3.1 mg/dL, total proteins 4.5 g/dL, albumin 1.7 g/dL, bicarbonate 30.1 mmol/L, cholesterol 441 mg/dL, triglycerides 151 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein 101 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein 339 mg/dL. Anti-nuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and serologic tests for hepatotropic virus, human immunodeficiency virus and treponema were negative, and her complement system, haemogram and thyroid function were normal. Urinalysis findings were proteinuria 11.7 g/day, Na 74 mmol/L, K 152.6 mmol/L, Ca 5.7 mg/dL (136.8 mg/day) and Mg 3.8 mg/dL. A renal biopsy showed: subendothelial and mesangial segmental C1q deposits, mainly located in the distal areas of the capillary loops (), with discrete mesangial proliferation, slight interstitial fibrosis and hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus ().\nHer definitive diagnosis was nephrotic syndrome secondary to C1q nephropathy, probably minimal change type. Treatment with steroids at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day was started. The nephrotic syndrome resolved after 6 weeks of treatment. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "Ms. JB, a 66-year-old Caucasian woman, was admitted to our inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit from her long term care (LTC) facility because of behavioral disturbances associated with her dementing illness. She was resistant to care, was having persistent vocalization, and was hallucinating. Functionally, she required full assistance with all her ADLs. Her past medical history included early-onset dementia of Alzheimer's type, severe, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and dysphagia. The patient did not have a history of psychiatric illness including anxiety, psychosis, substance abuse, or psychiatric hospitalizations.\nHer medications at admission to our unit were multivitamins, citalopram 20 mg po daily, simvastatin 40 mg po daily, Vitamin D3 1000 IU po daily, calcium carbonate 600 mg po bid, valproic acid sprinkles 375 mg po twice daily, docusate 100 mg po twice daily, and risperidone 0.5 mg po twice daily.\nOur review of record, indicates that the patient was being treated with citalopram, valproic acid sprinkles, and risperidone for the behavioral disturbances associated with her dementia. It is unclear exactly as to when the valproic acid sprinkles was started, but it appears that the patient was taking this drug for at least the last month prior to her hospitalization.\nOn admission examination, the patient was noted to be perseveratively calling out and crying. Her vital signs were stable, and she was uncooperative to the examination. She was underweight, at 66 inches in height, 99 lbs in weight, and body mass index (BMI) = 16 kg/m2. Despite her history of hypertension, her blood pressure (BP) on admission was low at 96/57 mm hg. She was noted to have a dysconjugate gaze. She had marked jerking movements of her upper extremities consistent with myoclonus. Muscle tone was increased, and it was difficult to assess for cogwheeling, as patient was unable to voluntarily relax her extremities. Myoclonus in her lower extremities was also noted when her feet were dorsiflexed. She was disoriented to time, place, and person and was unable to participate in a formal cognitive testing.\nLaboratory examination on admission revealed a low serum albumin of 3.4 gm/dL. Her ammonia level was low normal at 4 umol/L. Her valproic acid level was 39 mg/L, a level generally considered to be subtherapeutic for patients with seizure disorders. Sodium was 143 meq/L, potassium was 3.7 meq/L, chloride was 104 meq/L, bicarbonate was 33 meq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 12 mg/dL, serum creatinine was 0.7 mg/dL, glucose was 91 mg/dL, serum calcium was 8.5 mg/dL, aspartate transamisase (AST) was 7 iu/L, and alanine transaminase (ALT) was 21 iu/L. Vitamin B12, folate, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were normal. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Complete blood count (CBC) was normal with a white cell count of 8100/cmm, a hemoglobin level of 13.7 gm/dL, and a hematocrit of 41.2%.\nFollowing the initial evaluation, the VPA dose was decreased and then discontinued, with complete resolution of her myoclonus. Quetiapine was started and titrated to 25 mg po at noon and 12.5 mg po at 5 pm for agitation. Because of her late afternoon agitation, risperidone 0.5 mg was increased from twice a day to 0.5 mg po three times a day, with the additional dose given in the early afternoon. Her restlessness, agitation, vocalizations, hallucinations and resistance to care were significantly decreased from admission on this medication regimen. She was discharged back to her long term care facility in a stable state. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 40-year-old woman suffering from abdominal pain and diarrhea since September 1994 was admitted to another institution. She had undergone colonoscopic examination and endoscopy of the colon and histological examination showed chronic inflammatory bowel disease with signs of Crohns disease involving the entire colon and the terminal ileum. Differential therapeutic strategies, including corticosteroid, had improved the symptoms which were dominated by abdominal pain and bloody stools 5 times a day for 6 months. After stopping medication, including corticosteroid since Februrary 1995, she had experienced abdominal pain and bloody stool twice a day.\nWhen she visited our institute in April of 1995 due to ineffective long-term treatment with corticosteroid, she presented with bloody stool twice a day and 7kg weight loss in a period of six months. Among her complaints were having diarrhea over 5 times a day and bloody stool twice a day. She also complained of dizziness, anorexia and general weakness of the body. Physical examination revealed a slightly slender female. Her blood pressure was 130/80mmHg, pulse rate 85/min, respiratory rate 20/min and body temperature 36.\u00b0C. There was no abnormal sound in the chest. Abdominal palpatation and percussion indicated a slightly painful abdomen and showed normal peristalsis, no superficial lymphadenopathy and no hepatospelomegaly. Bowel sounds were decreased.\nThe hematocrit was 38.6% and the white cell count was 7300/mm3, with 89% polymorphonuclear cells and 5% lymphocyte. The serum sodium was 138mEq/L, potassium 4.0mEq/L, chloride 99mEq/L, bicarbonate 23.2mEq/L. The results of liver function tests were as follows : protein 7.3g/dl, albumin 4.4g/dl, cholesterol 189mg/dl, bilirubin 0.6mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 69U/L, AST 17U/L and ALT 13U/L. Urinalysis did not reveal any evidence of proteinuria. The result of a stool examination revealed positive occult blood. Anti-HIV was negative, findings on the chest radiograph and simple abdomen were normal. Colon study revealed shallow and geographic ulcerations along the entire colon. Small bowel series and enteroclysis revealed ulceration on the distal jejunum. Laboratory examination showed mild inflammatory activity, anemia, normal total and differential white blood cell counts and normal immunoglobulin values. Repeated stool cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography were both negative. In upper endoscopy, we were able to find only multiple erosions of the gastric mucosa. Histological examination of the stomach showed only inflammatory infiltrate. Colonoscopy showed geographic ulcerations along the entire colon, especially rectum and terminal ileum(). Histologic examination of the colon showed diffuse infiltration of monotonous small atypical lymphocytes in the laminar propria of the colon(). These atypical lymphocytes invaded the epithelium of the crypts, mimicking a lymphoepithelial lesion of low grade B cell lymphoma of MALT type. However, they were positive for CD45RO() and CD3, negative for CD20. Thus, a diagnosis of primary T-cell lymphoma, small cell type, was made. Although there was reactive epithelial change including depletion, no histologic evidence of inflammtory bowel disease was found in the uninvolved mucosa. Also, we reviewed the pathology of the colon which was taken from colonoscopy at another institute. The histologic findings were very similar to those of the 2nd biopsy except for marked acute inflammatory reaction associated with mucosal ulceration. There were dense atypical small lympohoid infiltrates in the lamina propria with destruction of colonic glands and crypts. No evidence of Crohns disease was present. The histologic finding of bone marrow was negative. In conclusion, she had developed primary T-cell lymphoma of the colon. What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?",

    "question": "A 4-year-old boy, who had no systemic or inherited disease, presented with a 3-week history of intermittent vomiting without diarrhea or abdominal pain. In the past year, he experienced polydipsia and polyuria. Physical examination revealed body weight 17.5 kg (50th percentile), body height 100 cm (15~50th percentile), blood pressure 230/120 mmHg, heart rate 138 /min, and decreased skin turgor. There was no focal neurological deficit, blood pressure discrepancy between upper and lower extremities, palpable mass, nor any appreciation of an abdominal thrill. Laboratory studies revealed serum Na+ 124 mmol/L, K+ 2.4 mmol/L, Cl\u2212 87 mmol/L, Ca2+ 8.5 mg/dL, HCO3\u2212 34.5 mEq/L, creatinine 0.41 mg/dL, albumin 3.4 g/dL, IgG 247 mg/dL, and osmolality 290 mOsm/KgH2O. Urine analysis was significant for creatinine 11.2 mg/dL, Na+ 24 mEq/L, K+ 18 mEq/L, Cl\u2212 24 mEq/L, osmolality 232 mOsm/KgH2O, RBC 168/\u03bcL, FENa 6%, and nephrotic-range proteinuria (55 mg/m2/hour). Survey for possible glomerulonephritis demonstrated the absence of anti-streptolysin O, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, ANA, and normal immunoglobulin A, C3, and C4 levels. In addition, work-up for secondary hypertension included: free T4 1.51 (normal range 0.8\u20132.0 ng/dL), TSH 5.7 (normal range 0.25\u20135.00 \u03bcIU/mL), cortisol 40.18 (normal range 4.3\u201325 \u03bcg/dL), ACTH 9.32 (normal range < 46 pg/mL), renin 1745 (normal range 2\u201315 ng/L), aldosterone 92.6 (normal range 4\u201325 ng/dL), and urine vanillylmandelic acid 3.8 (normal range 1.9\u20139.9 g/day). Renal ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic right kidney (7.6 cm in length) and small left kidney (5.3 cm in length). Due to the presence of hyperreninemic hypertension, natriuretic-hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and nephrotic range proteinuria, HHS was highly suspected. Computed tomography angiography confirmed high-grade renal artery stenosis with hypoplasia of the left kidney (Fig. ).\nIn terms of management for this case, we began with volume repletion by normal saline administration. Subsequently, his blood pressure declined from 210/120 mmHg to 180/90 mmHg. Intravenous calcium channel blocker was used to treat his hypertensive emergency, while oral captopril was prescribed for RAA axis blockage after diagnosis of unilateral renal artery stenosis. The systolic blood pressure gradually declined to 150~160 mmHg on the 3rd day. Potassium supplement was infused for his profound hypokalemia and generalized muscle weakness. Due to the severity of left renal artery stenosis, he was not a candidate for angiographic intervention, and decision was made to proceed with left nephrectomy. Overall, electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia and hypokalemia were corrected within 1 week after admission, and resolution of polyuria, polydipsia, proteinuria, and hypertension were achieved 2 weeks after nephrectomy (Additional file : Table S1).
