    "question": "A sequence is an ordered collection of objects (usually numbers), which are allowed to repeat. Sequences can be finite or infinite. Two examples are the finite sequence (π,−2–√,0,π)\n and the infinite sequence of odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9,…)\n. We use the notation an\n to represent the n\n-th term of a sequence.\n\nA recurrence relation is a way of defining the terms of a sequence with respect to the values of previous terms. In the case of Fibonacci's rabbits from the introduction, any given month will contain the rabbits that were alive the previous month, plus any new offspring. A key observation is that the number of offspring in any month is equal to the number of rabbits that were alive two months prior. As a result, if Fn\n represents the number of rabbit pairs alive after the n\n-th month, then we obtain the Fibonacci sequence having terms Fn\n that are defined by the recurrence relation Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2\n (with F1=F2=1\n to initiate the sequence). Although the sequence bears Fibonacci's name, it was known to Indian mathematicians over two millennia ago.\n\nWhen finding the n\n-th term of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, we can simply use the recurrence relation to generate terms for progressively larger values of n\n. This problem introduces us to the computational technique of dynamic programming, which successively builds up solutions by using the answers to smaller cases.\n\nGiven: Positive integers n≤40\n and k≤5\n.\n\nReturn: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n\n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k\n rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).\n\nSample Dataset\n5 3",

    "question": "A binary tree is a tree in which each node has degree equal to at most 3. The binary tree will be our main tool in the construction of phylogenies.\n\nA rooted tree is a tree in which one node (the root) is set aside to serve as the pinnacle of the tree. A standard graph theory exercise is to verify that for any two nodes of a tree, exactly one path connects the nodes. In a rooted tree, every node v\n will therefore have a single parent, or the unique node w\n such that the path from v\n to the root contains {v,w}\n. Any other node x\n adjacent to v\n is called a child of v\n because v\n must be the parent of x\n; note that a node may have multiple children. In other words, a rooted tree possesses an ordered hierarchy from the root down to its leaves, and as a result, we may often view a rooted tree with undirected edges as a directed graph in which each edge is oriented from parent to child. We should already be familiar with this idea; it's how the Rosalind problem tree works!\n\nEven though a binary tree can include nodes having degree 2, an unrooted binary tree is defined more specifically: all internal nodes have degree 3.

For example, Figure 1 demonstrates that \\( m_6 = 21 \\). Note in this figure that technically, the \"trivial\" matching that contains no edges at all is considered to be a matching, because it satisfies the defining condition that no two edges are incident to the same node.\n\nHow should we compute the Motzkin numbers? As with Catalan numbers, we will take \\( m_0 = m_1 = 1 \\). To calculate \\( m_n \\) in general, assume that the nodes of \\( K_n \\) are labeled around the outside of a circle with the integers between 1 and \\( n \\), and consider node 1, which may or may not be involved in a matching. If node 1 is not involved in a matching, then there are \\( m_{n-1} \\) ways of matching the remaining \\( n-1 \\) nodes.

For every unique first symbol in the strings, an edge is formed connecting the root to a new vertex. This symbol is then used to label the edge.\n\nWe may then iterate the process by moving down one level as follows. Say that an edge connecting the root to a node \\( V \\) is labeled with 'A'; then we delete the first symbol from every string in the collection beginning with 'A' and then treat \\( V \\) as our root. We apply this process to all nodes that are adjacent to the root, and then we move down another level and continue. See Figure 1 for an example of a trie.\n\nAs a result of this method of construction, the symbols along the edges of any path in the trie from the root to a leaf will spell out a unique string from the collection, as long as no string is a prefix of another in the collection (this would cause the first string to be encoded as a path terminating at an internal node).\n\nGiven: A list of at most 100 DNA strings of length at most 100 bp, none of which is a prefix of another.\n\nReturn: The adjacency list corresponding to the trie \\( T \\) for these patterns, in the following format.

Writing \\( S' \\) directly over \\( t' \\) so that symbols are **aligned** provides us with a scenario for transforming \\( S \\) into \\( t \\).

We define the corresponding **edit alignment score** of \\( S' \\) and \\( t' \\) as \\( d_H(S', t') \\) (Hamming distance is used because the gap symbol has been introduced for insertions and deletions).
