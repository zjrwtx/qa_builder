    "question": "A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination. She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.\nUpon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th–75th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th–75th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4–48 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.\nA right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm ×2.2 cm×2.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()\nPostoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",

    "question": "A 56-year-old man was admitted to the renal unit of the tertiary university hospital with symptoms of polyuria with nocturia, and polydipsia with severe thirst for the past 2 months. Initially, the patient visited a local clinic and was diagnosed as type 2 DM with a fasting blood sugar, 150mg/dL. Despite being controlled hyperglycemia with an oral hypoglycemic agent, he continued drinking daily more than 8 L of cold water (about 10 bottles of refrigerated water, 750 ml capacity) and passed large amounts of urine frequently. He had no specific history including head trauma or mental disorder, and denied any pertinent family history. The patient showed no signs of systemic illness such as fever or arthralgia, or neurologic symptoms involving the central nervous system. He has been working as a gardener with 176 cm in height and 68 kg in weight (71 kg before this event). The physical examination was unremarkable with blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, pulse rate of 80/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and temperature of 36.8℃. In the laboratory findings, his white blood cell count was 9,700/mm3; hemoglobin, 13.4 g/dL; platelet, 376×103/mm3; sodium, 140 mEq/L; potassium, 3.8 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 12 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL and osmolality 295 mOsm/kg water. HbA1c was 7.2% and post-prandial glucose was checked around 180mg/dl with fasting blood sugar of 140 mg/dL. In urine analysis, the urine pH was 6.0; specific gravity 1.006; albumin (-); glucose (-); WBC 0-4/HPF; RBC 0-2/HPF, and osmolality 140mOsm/kg water. Fluid intake and output in 24 hours recorded 9 L in oral water intake from water containers and 11.7 L in urine output. In hormone assays, ACTH was 25.2 pg/mL (reference value, 6.0-76.0 pg/mL), prolactin 8 µg/L (reference value, 0-15 µg/L), cortisol 9.8 µg/dL (referencel value, 5-25 µg/dL), hGH 2.26 ng/mL (reference value, 0.5-17 ng/mL), and TSH 0.99 µU/mL (reference value, 0.5-4.7 µU/mL). Also, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was within normal range (reference value, <40 U/L).\nOn hospital day 5, the patient underwent a water deprivation test according to the method of Miller-Moses test because of persistent polydipsia and polyuria despite blood glucose control. The results are shown in . During dehydration, the patient lost 3kg (4.4% of body weight), and urine osmolality remained hypotonic below 130 mOsm/kg. Basal ADH level was 5.18 pg/dL, and the repeat ADH level following the stimulation by water deprivation was 3.95 pg/dL, which revealed no increment despite the increased serum osmolality up to 300 mOsm/kg from the baseline levels of 285 to 295 mOsm/kg. One puff (5 µg) of desmopressin nasal spray resulted in the increase of urine osmolality to 266 mOsm/kg (>100% increase from the baseline level, 126 mOsm/kg) and in the marked reduction of urine output from 200-410 ml/hr to 44-60 ml/hr. These results were compatible with CDI,, whose causes would be mostly idiopathic because of normal findings in hypothalamus and hypophysis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of sella ().\nOn discharge (hospital day 9), the dose of desmopressin nasal spray (minirin nasal spray®) was adjusted to 1 puff per 12 hrs (10 µg/day), and urine output was markedly reduced to below 2-3 L/day with no more intense thirst. Also, DM was controlled with fasting blood sugar below 115 mg/dL by metformin (novamet GR® 500mg bid) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended diet. What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",
